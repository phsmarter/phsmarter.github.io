                                            Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows.This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample.In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.Source:http://www.uwlux.edu/uploaded Files/Academics/Departments/Political_Science_and_Public_Admin/journal_article_critique_example.pdfType of Document:Purpose of the:Review:Writer’s Persona:Intended Reader:Strengths:Weaknesses:​</a>

It seemed to be sobeneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act(similarly. For children,having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, imate for sharingnumerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help inthe time of need. Howevery having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins.share many interests: they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in anyother relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits.The advantages of being a twin are especiall evident in the early childhood years. In the earlyyears, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Siblingrivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birthFurthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense ofsupport and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs oflife and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support whichbuilds their relationship and creates trust between themIn contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacyand sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and fromparents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both becamewuccessful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012.para 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. Thetwins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remainstangiyatatamaran​</a>

In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample.
In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.
There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.

                                            B. Group gathered data on their chosen topic Instructions: 1. Choose a topic: The first step is you have to choose a topic that you are interested in and want to create a frequency distribution table for. The topic could be anything from sports to movies to books. But it is best to choose a topic where you can get numerical data related to industry. Example; Number of Employees and their Salary, Number of time spent in study and their academic performance (Grade). You are encouraged also to advocate a social issue and use that information in this activity. I f you're advocating for women's rights, you may gather data on the frequency of abuse experienced by women in different age groups etc. 2. Collect data: You should then collect data on their chosen topic. This could involve conducting a survey, researching online, or using data from a reliable source. The data collected should be numerical in nature.3. Organize the data: Next, you should organize the data into a table. You should list the values of the data in one column and the corresponding frequency in another column. The frequency is the number of times a particular value occurs in the data set.4. Determine the class intervals: Depending on the range of values in the data set, you should determine the class intervals. Class intervals are the ranges of values that are used to group the data in the frequency distribution table. For example, if the data set ranges from 1 to 100, you may choose to group the data into intervals of 10.5. Group the data: Using the class intervals determined in step 4, you should group the data into the appropriate intervals. They should then count the number of values that fall within each interval to determine the frequency.6. Create the frequency distribution table: Using the organized and grouped data, you should create a frequency distribution table. The table should have columns for the class intervals, the frequency, and possibly a column for cumulative frequency.7. Check for accuracy: Finally, you should double-check their work to ensure that the frequency distribution table is accurate and complete.​</a>

Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</a>

                                            A. Create a frequency distribution table for the standard deviation of Asian countries and use the method of computing measures of central tendency for ungrouped data to calculate the central tendency measures.B. Group gathered data on their chosen topic Instructions: 1. Choose a topic: The first step is you have to choose a topic that you are interested in and want to create a frequency distribution table for. The topic could be anything from sports to movies to books. But it is best to choose a topic where you can get numerical data related to industry. Example; Number of Employees and their Salary, Number of time spent in study and their academic performance (Grade). You are encouraged also to advocate a social issue and use that information in this activity. I f you're advocating for women's rights, you may gather data on the frequency of abuse experienced by women in different age groups etc. 2. Collect data: You should then collect data on their chosen topic. This could involve conducting a survey, researching online, or using data from a reliable source. The data collected should be numerical in nature. 3. Organize the data: Next, you should organize the data into a table. You should list the values of the data in one column and the corresponding frequency in another column. The frequency is the number of times a particular value occurs in the data set. 4. Determine the class intervals: Depending on the range of values in the data set, you should determine the class intervals. Class intervals are the ranges of values that are used to group the data in the frequency distribution table. For example, if the data set ranges from 1 to 100, you may choose to group the data into intervals of 10. 5. Group the data: Using the class intervals determined in step 4, you should group the data into the appropriate intervals. They should then count the number of values that fall within each interval to determine the frequency. 6. Create the frequency distribution table: Using the organized and grouped data, you should create a frequency distribution table. The table should have columns for the class intervals, the frequency, and possibly a column for cumulative frequency. 7. Check for accuracy: Finally, you should double-check their work to ensure that the frequency distribution table is accurate and complete. ​</a>

Even in English, reading Death of a Naturalist Seamus Heaney, I found myself thinking up an experiment to do with dragonflies and fireflies. I have a fish tank at home with three different sorts of fish. I've noticed that they all respond differently when I feed them. I'm wondering what else is different in their behavior so, in this extended essay, I'm going to find out how they react to light. 3. When I go into a supermarket there is always gentle background music playing, although in the clothes shop I like it is always pop music. At breakfast my dad likes to listen to Apo Hiking Society, while my little brother has rock songs on his phone and will head bang his way through the dining area. My essay is trying to research why people rely on certain types of music to influence their mood and how music is used in this way for advertising. I am not sure if there is a connection and whether the music does affect, for example, people's shopping habits, but it will be interesting to try to find out, especially to see if different peoples' brains are wired differently when it com 1. 2. 3. pa help ​</a>

                                            How important is research for teachers in general, and ICT teachers in particular? One might be tempted to say that people learn in the same way now as they did thousands of years ago, so research, apart from keeping abreast of the latest developments in technology, is pretty redundant. I think there are problems with that attitude. First, we don't know what we don't know. Research can shed light on issues we didn't even know existed, and can raise questions we hadn't realized even needed asking. Second, I'm not convinced that people do learn in the same way as they did thousands of years ago. Technology has meant that we can make mistakes that would have been fatal in the past, through the use of simulations and modelling. Social media has meant that we can canvass, or be exposed to, views from a much wider range of people than would have been possible hitherto. This happens almost by accident. For example, I recently wrote an article about how school districts in the USA are spending their money on computer hardware. This led to comments by John McLear, Michael Pickett and someone called Hamish. All their views are interesting, especially as two of them (John and Michael) seem to feel the same way as I do about tablets vs netbooks (article on that subject is already in the works). Moreover, Michael has provided a couple of links to articles on his website which I am looking forward to reading, and provided a further reference on Twitter this morning. Perhaps in a sense the actual mechanisms by which stuff enters our brains, stays there and then becomes useful in a practical way really hasn't changed for millennia - which may or may not be true, but in a sense that is irrelevant. The Importance of Research for ICT Teachers February 8, 2011 I'd also say that, if you discovered that your doctor hasn't read a medical journal article since he or she qualified, you might consider changing your doctor! Hopefully, research is not a life or death issue in education, but I do believe that what makes a professional a professional is keeping up-to-date with the issues and thinking that are pertinent to that subject. That's why it's quite right that the powersthat-be believe teachers should continue to do research, although I agree with Christina Preston (see below) that such research doesn't have to be at Masters level. What is research? On the one hand you have the highly academic stuff that universities and other institutions engage in. On the other hand, you have Freda Bloggs keeping a note of what happens in her classroom when she introduces a new application into her teaching. And somewhere in the middle are people like myself, who carry out research via online surveys or on Twitter. The methodology may not be scientific in the true sense of the term, but I like to think that at the very least it can act as a catalyst for discussion and flag up issues for further exploration.

Then, complete the table that follows.This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, the authors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boost up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. It is interesting that the language background of the participants is never made explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English is a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draw on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per grade level, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level on both accredited and non-accredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produce 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample.In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack of research problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have a time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.Source:http://www.uwlux.edu/uploaded Files/Academics/Departments/Political_Science_and_Public_Admin/journal_article_critique_example.pdfType of Document:Purpose of the:Review:Writer’s Persona:Intended Reader:Strengths:Weaknesses:​</h2><br />

It seemed to be sobeneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act(similarly. For children,having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, imate for sharingnumerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help inthe time of need. Howevery having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins.share many interests: they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in anyother relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits.The advantages of being a twin are especiall evident in the early childhood years. In the earlyyears, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Siblingrivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birthFurthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense ofsupport and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs oflife and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support whichbuilds their relationship and creates trust between themIn contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacyand sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and fromparents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both becamewuccessful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012.para 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. Thetwins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remainstangiyatatamaran​</h2><br />

                            11. B. Group gathered data on their chosen topic Instructions: 1. Choose a topic: The first step is you have to choose a topic that you are interested in and want to create a frequency distribution table for. The topic could be anything from sports to movies to books. But it is best to choose a topic where you can get numerical data related to industry. Example; Number of Employees and their Salary, Number of time spent in study and their academic performance (Grade). You are encouraged also to advocate a social issue and use that information in this activity. I f you're advocating for women's rights, you may gather data on the frequency of abuse experienced by women in different age groups etc. 2. Collect data: You should then collect data on their chosen topic. This could involve conducting a survey, researching online, or using data from a reliable source. The data collected should be numerical in nature.3. Organize the data: Next, you should organize the data into a table. You should list the values of the data in one column and the corresponding frequency in another column. The frequency is the number of times a particular value occurs in the data set.4. Determine the class intervals: Depending on the range of values in the data set, you should determine the class intervals. Class intervals are the ranges of values that are used to group the data in the frequency distribution table. For example, if the data set ranges from 1 to 100, you may choose to group the data into intervals of 10.5. Group the data: Using the class intervals determined in step 4, you should group the data into the appropriate intervals. They should then count the number of values that fall within each interval to determine the frequency.6. Create the frequency distribution table: Using the organized and grouped data, you should create a frequency distribution table. The table should have columns for the class intervals, the frequency, and possibly a column for cumulative frequency.7. Check for accuracy: Finally, you should double-check their work to ensure that the frequency distribution table is accurate and complete.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>Let's say we want to create a frequency distribution table for the ages of a group of people attending a music festival. We collected the data on the ages of 100 people and we want to group the data into intervals of 5. Here's an example of how the frequency distribution table could look like:</p><p></p><p>Age Interval	Frequency</p><p>15-19	12</p><p>20-24	30</p><p>25-29	25</p><p>30-34	18</p><p>35-39	10</p><p>Total	100</p><p>In this example, we chose to group the data into intervals of 5 and the data ranges from 15 to 39. The frequency column indicates the number of people whose ages fall within each interval. For example, 12 people are between the ages of 15-19, 30 people are between the ages of 20-24, and so on. The last row of the table shows the total number of people, which should always be equal to the sum of the frequencies.</p><br />

Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</h2><br />

                            21. A. Create a frequency distribution table for the standard deviation of Asian countries and use the method of computing measures of central tendency for ungrouped data to calculate the central tendency measures.B. Group gathered data on their chosen topic Instructions: 1. Choose a topic: The first step is you have to choose a topic that you are interested in and want to create a frequency distribution table for. The topic could be anything from sports to movies to books. But it is best to choose a topic where you can get numerical data related to industry. Example; Number of Employees and their Salary, Number of time spent in study and their academic performance (Grade). You are encouraged also to advocate a social issue and use that information in this activity. I f you're advocating for women's rights, you may gather data on the frequency of abuse experienced by women in different age groups etc. 2. Collect data: You should then collect data on their chosen topic. This could involve conducting a survey, researching online, or using data from a reliable source. The data collected should be numerical in nature. 3. Organize the data: Next, you should organize the data into a table. You should list the values of the data in one column and the corresponding frequency in another column. The frequency is the number of times a particular value occurs in the data set. 4. Determine the class intervals: Depending on the range of values in the data set, you should determine the class intervals. Class intervals are the ranges of values that are used to group the data in the frequency distribution table. For example, if the data set ranges from 1 to 100, you may choose to group the data into intervals of 10. 5. Group the data: Using the class intervals determined in step 4, you should group the data into the appropriate intervals. They should then count the number of values that fall within each interval to determine the frequency. 6. Create the frequency distribution table: Using the organized and grouped data, you should create a frequency distribution table. The table should have columns for the class intervals, the frequency, and possibly a column for cumulative frequency. 7. Check for accuracy: Finally, you should double-check their work to ensure that the frequency distribution table is accurate and complete. ​</h2><br />

                            28. How important is research for teachers in general, and ICT teachers in particular? One might be tempted to say that people learn in the same way now as they did thousands of years ago, so research, apart from keeping abreast of the latest developments in technology, is pretty redundant. I think there are problems with that attitude. First, we don't know what we don't know. Research can shed light on issues we didn't even know existed, and can raise questions we hadn't realized even needed asking. Second, I'm not convinced that people do learn in the same way as they did thousands of years ago. Technology has meant that we can make mistakes that would have been fatal in the past, through the use of simulations and modelling. Social media has meant that we can canvass, or be exposed to, views from a much wider range of people than would have been possible hitherto. This happens almost by accident. For example, I recently wrote an article about how school districts in the USA are spending their money on computer hardware. This led to comments by John McLear, Michael Pickett and someone called Hamish. All their views are interesting, especially as two of them (John and Michael) seem to feel the same way as I do about tablets vs netbooks (article on that subject is already in the works). Moreover, Michael has provided a couple of links to articles on his website which I am looking forward to reading, and provided a further reference on Twitter this morning. Perhaps in a sense the actual mechanisms by which stuff enters our brains, stays there and then becomes useful in a practical way really hasn't changed for millennia - which may or may not be true, but in a sense that is irrelevant. The Importance of Research for ICT Teachers February 8, 2011 I'd also say that, if you discovered that your doctor hasn't read a medical journal article since he or she qualified, you might consider changing your doctor! Hopefully, research is not a life or death issue in education, but I do believe that what makes a professional a professional is keeping up-to-date with the issues and thinking that are pertinent to that subject. That's why it's quite right that the powersthat-be believe teachers should continue to do research, although I agree with Christina Preston (see below) that such research doesn't have to be at Masters level. What is research? On the one hand you have the highly academic stuff that universities and other institutions engage in. On the other hand, you have Freda Bloggs keeping a note of what happens in her classroom when she introduces a new application into her teaching. And somewhere in the middle are people like myself, who carry out research via online surveys or on Twitter. The methodology may not be scientific in the true sense of the term, but I like to think that at the very least it can act as a catalyst for discussion and flag up issues for further exploration.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Research is extremely important for all teachers, including ICT teachers. It is through research that teachers are able to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in technology and teaching methodologies, and to gain a deeper understanding of the issues that affect their students.
