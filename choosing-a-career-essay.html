                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Firstly, allowing children to choose their own career helps them to discover their true passions and talents. Children are naturally curious and have a sense of what interests them. By allowing them to explore their interests, they can find what they are passionate about and what they are good at. This can lead to greater job satisfaction, as they are doing something they enjoy.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, when children are allowed to choose their own career, they are more likely to take ownership of their decisions. This sense of ownership and responsibility can lead to greater motivation and effort in pursuing their chosen career path. They are also more likely to stick with their chosen career path, rather than being forced into a career that they have no interest in.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, allowing children to choose their own career can foster independence and confidence. When children make their own decisions, they learn to trust themselves and their abilities. This can lead to greater self-esteem and confidence in their own abilities to make decisions and handle challenges.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Nursing is a rewarding career that involves caring for patients and helping them achieve optimal health. Nurses work in a variety of settings, including hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and schools. They provide direct patient care, administer medications, monitor vital signs, and collaborate with other healthcare professionals to develop treatment plans.</p><p></p><p>Some people choose nursing as a career because they have a natural inclination to help others and make a difference in people's lives. Others are drawn to the profession because of the job security and opportunities for advancement. Nursing is also a field that offers a wide range of specialties, such as pediatrics, oncology, and critical care.</p><p></p><p>If you are considering a career in nursing, it is important to research the educational requirements and job outlook for the profession. You will need to complete a nursing program and obtain a license in order to practice as a nurse. Additionally, it is important to have strong communication skills, empathy, and the ability to work well under pressure.</p><p>I chose nursing as my career option because it can be a rewarding experience and provides an opportunity to make a positive impact on people's lives. Moreover, the demand for nurses is expected to grow in the coming years due to the aging population and increasing healthcare needs. This means that there will be more job opportunities and career growth for those who choose this profession.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong>A career can be defined as a person's progress within an occupation or series of occupations. However, a career is more than just a job, or working, or your occupation. It also includes your progress through life, your growth and development in vocational and avocational areas of life. Deciding on your initial career may present a stressful and frightening prospect. Many tend to perceive career decision-making as complex or even mysterious, only because they tend to concentrate on the outcome and overlook the decision-making and planning process. Successful career decisions are based on current and accurate information. Today, career information is abundant and easily accessible. While this is exciting and potentially helpful, it can also be overwhelming. Nevertheless, one major fact emerges from the mass of data and literature available: effective career planning is a process that involves the total person. Comprehensive career planning stresses the importance of knowing enough about your unique attributes, about specific career fields, and about your life priorities.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Basically, I want to become a lawyer because I believe that it is a good way of rendering service to society and that it will fully develop in me skills, abilities, and attitudes that I can apply in a lot of aspects of my life. I believe that the law profession plays an integral role in any community as it is generally works to analyze and solve legal theories and ensure that justice is enforced. In this regard, I want to be involved in that kind of profession while at the same time ensuring my professional growth.<p></p>For me, the interesting characteristics that a lawyer possesses are his or her wit, boldness, and audacity. In general, a lawyer exudes confidence and integrity while doing his or her job because this creates an aura of authority and professionalism around him. A lawyer must also be in total control of his or her emotions at all times especially during intense moments in court. In addition, it is notable that he or she works well under pressure, which is something I would like to emulate and apply in various situations in my life. In this regard, I want to have the same kind of confidence and calmness and possess unparalleled analytical and critical skills because this would no doubt aid me in several aspects of my life. I also believe that at present, I possess all of these traits and this is why I am convinced that the law profession is for me.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        To choose a career, put enough thought into it and you will increase your chances of making a good decision. Think wisely and carefully. Follow what interests you and what's your passion.<br /><br />Choosing a career is one of the most important decisions you will make in life. It's about so much more than deciding what you will do to make a living. <br />

                            14. Adjust the present choice of career in consideration of the various aspects in choosing a career?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>4 Factors to Consider When Choosing Your Career Path</p><p></p><p>1.Personality</p><p></p><p>One of the most valuable things to consider is the nature of your personality and the level of satisfaction that you would like to achieve from your work. Someone who is extraverted enjoys interacting with others and finds job satisfaction in roles that require a lot of socializing. Extraverts perform well in areas such as sales and marketing, medicine, healthcare, and customer service. “Extraverts may find themselves unhappy in a job that requires them to work alone for extended periods. On the contrary, those who are more introverted usually prefer to work alone or in smaller groups. Careers in freelance writing and editing, software engineering and paralegal are mostly populated by introverts,” explains Fiona Adams, a writer at 1 Day 2 Write and Write My X.</p><p></p><p>2.Lifestyle</p><p></p><p>It’s important to strike a balance between what you need and what you want. Geography is also another factor to consider. If you are someone who does not like hustle and bustle, you may not want to pursue a city-based career that involves a long commute. Likewise, if you are someone who loves the fast-paced city life, you may not want to settle in a job that requires you to work in remote locations. However, it is important not to place yourself into a box! Remember that people are complicated, and personality works on a spectrum.</p><p></p><p>3.Transferrable Skills</p><p></p><p>“So, you know the type of career that you want, but what is the best way to go about getting that dream job? Try choosing a path that utilizes the skills that you already have or learn garner skills that will take you in a new direction,” says Rachel Christensen, an educator at Britstudent and NextCoursework. Matching your future career to your current skill set may mean that your interests and experience are better aligned, making success come easier. For example, a car mechanic who’s tired of working in a repair shop may take an engineering course so they can work on design projects in an office instead. Not only does the former mechanic now have new design skills, but their prior knowledge in the industry will also be a great advantage in the new role.</p><p></p><p>4.A New Path</p><p></p><p>If it is a complete change that you are looking for, you can study something entirely different by going back to school or college, or gaining experience in a new industry by starting in an entry-level position. However, you may have commitments that mean you are unable to take a career break or temporary pay cut while you re-train. In that case, look for ways to enroll in an online or evening course. Online courses are very flexible and can work around your current job. Always remember that when you embark on a new career path, employers will consider your previous experience as valuable, even if it is in an unrelated field.</p><br />

                        Passing high school is crucial, what to do next – is even more critical. Making a right career choice involves a lot of thinking as you have to analyze various majors and right colleges. Today, most of the students are forced to opt for a career according to the choice of their parents.<br /><br />Parents are the major influential factor in the career development of a child.<br /><br />The world is changing, and the dreams of each teen change accordingly. Children should choose their career path and live their dreams. However, the real world experience of parents definitely cannot be put on a back seat. So, who should be the one choosing a career for a child — the child himself, parents or both together?<br /><br />If parents choose their child’s career, they will be more supportive of their child’s future. Many parents who have failed their past career goals set them on their children, and seem to relive their aspirations in their child. The parent then does as much as they can to make sure that their child lives the life they wish they could live by overspending on opportunities to ensure success with that career. <br />Adding on, parents have more experience in the world than their child, and therefore have a better understanding of the right and wrong decisions for career paths. In a parent’s perspective, a child could possibly end up making a bad decision for their future. The parent could act as a guide to make sure that their child makes good life decisions and doesn’t set unrealistic goals for themselves.<br />However, although parents seem to know everything that will lead to a successful future, the opposite may be true. Children know themselves better than anyone else, including their parents. By choosing their own career paths, children are setting themselves up for a future that they are interested in. Instead of living a monotonous life, they will be enjoying whatever career they choose based on their interests.<br />Furthermore, children have the right to choose what they want to achieve in the future. Every child has their dream career, and it is up to them if they want to follow their career dreams or not.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Career planning is always important. It is through career planning that I will be guided on my plans in pursuing the chosen field. With such, it is necessary to base my health career on my skills and interest.</p><p>As I set my foot to achieve my dreams, I should know that together with my aspirations is my inclinations on the chosen field. Why must my skills and interest be in accordance with my future health career? Simply because I cannot fully function in my chosen career if my abilities, values and personality do not align with it. Choosing a career that is way far from who I am and what I am capable of doing is like departing to the ocean without proper destination. If my skills are not in line with my career, then I will be not functional in that field in any way. Besides, I will just be wasting my time, effort and money in preparing for the field that will not give me self-fulfillment as a person and as a member of the society.</p><p></p><p>With such, I need to fully understand first who I am before I will work on my dreams of playing an important role in the society.</p><p></p><p>For reference about health career:</p><p> https://brainly.ph/question/2644800</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2580998</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>#BrainlyFast</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            18. Essay about Career talk​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Each and every one of us has faced a certain junction or a cross-road at some point in our lives that has had a major impact on our lives. This can be both a professional crossroads or personal crossroads. But in this essay on career, I would like to talk about the cross-road that we see in our professional career. It’s not just the students who would have faced a dilemma in deciding a career, even employees past 30 years of age face this crisis.</p><p>When a student’s face its called a beginner’s crisis, but when an employee 6 years down the lane faces dilemmas in his or her career choices, then its usually called a mid-life crisis or mid-career crisis. Midlife crisis is a term that refers to people who are having second thoughts about their career a few years down after working in the same. There might be plenty of reasons for these some of which may be an everyday monologue, fatigue, salary issues, professional growth issues, internal office dilemmas, etc. In this essay on career, I am going to talk about both the type of career choices.</p><p></p><p>A student’s life is the first crossroad that we face in our lives. By keeping certain factors in mind, there is plenty of career choice a student can choose from. Some of the popular career choices are engineering, medicine, arts, and commerce. Which career to choose and on what terms is something that every student will have to worry about. There are certain criteria to choose a career, which are:</p><p></p>Passion: The word passion sounds cliche, but it is an important criterion to consider before choosing a career path. If everyone follows their passion and chose a career accordingly, then the concept of a mid-career crisis wouldn’t have occurred in the first place. Every one of us would have dreamt of something during our childhood. We all wanted to become a police, a cricketer, an actor, a doctor or an engineer. But not everyone follows and listens to the child in them. We ultimately give up on our passions and choose a safe career which will give us a good salary. Risk-taking is a part and parcel of life and no one should regret not doing something 80 years down the lane when they are on their death bed.Stability: Financial stability, as well as job stability, is something that should be considered as an important criterion. Because the world is increasingly changing and many industries are being taken out by emerging technologies. So before choosing a particular career path, the stability as the well the salary factors should be taken into accountFuture prospects: Future prospects, both in terms of your interest in the field as well the survival of the field itself, in the next 20 years should be taken into consideration. A Mid-career crisis can be avoided if future prospects are evaluated properly. Certain industries might fall and certain might become the next biggest phenomenon. People who are serious about their careers choose a path which has a long-lasting prospectSatisfaction: This is another important factor while choosing a career path. A good salary, a nice work environment and a good location might give some people the job satisfaction they need, but there are some people who are not affected by any of that. The only thing that matters to them is the job itself. Usually, a job that is socially helpful is the ones that provide true satisfaction.<p></p><br />

A worldview is a way in which we see the world and the people around us. A worldview is like looking through glasses because a person’s worldview clarifies the way, in which they view people and the world around them. A person’s worldview is the foundational element that guides their decision-making. Worldviews are a set of presuppositions that are different from person to person, but are crucial to understand because they provide the basis for our decision-making. As a Christian there are certain elements that should be contained in a Christian worldview. (105)</p><p></p><p>A Christian worldview starts with the belief that God exists.

That does not mean that I am looking for a pastor to be president, but rather that I look at what presidential candidate’s beliefs are and check their beliefs against the Bible. Voting for a candidate that aligns pretty close with what Christians believe is best because that means the candidate will do their best to run the country to honor God. Another key area that my worldview should influence is my future career because whatever I decide to do, I should have the mindset to honor and serve God with my career. As of right now, my future plans are to become a counselor and that aligns with my beliefs because I know that there are many people that are hurting in this world. Those hurting people need encouragement, but they also need to know that God is always there for them.

As I began my career planning in High school the realization of how long it would take to become a doctor discouraged me. I once again changed my career goals to becoming a teacher, and then finally to a nurse who could assist with the delivery of babies. Making the right choice was important to me and that explains the ever changing career decisions. After doing some research I decided that a nurse midwife was along the lines of where I want to be. Completing this the personal career development plan will not only help me see my goals on paper but will give me something to look back on when I have acquired all the goals I set to accomplish.</p><br />
