It involves a commitment to promoting peace, justice, and sustainability, as well as respecting and valuing cultural diversity.</p><p></p><p>One characteristic of global citizenship is an awareness of global issues and an ability to analyze and evaluate information from diverse sources. Another characteristic is a willingness to take action to address global problems, whether through personal or collective efforts.</p><p></p><p>To become a global citizen, one may need to develop skills such as intercultural communication, empathy, and critical thinking. Additionally, a global citizen should have a deep sense of social responsibility, respect for human rights, and a commitment to ethical values.</p><p></p><p>One ethical obligation of global citizens is to promote social justice and equality. This can be applied in many ways, such as supporting efforts to reduce poverty, promoting access to education and healthcare, or advocating for human rights.</p><p></p><p>One real experience of applying an ethical obligation of a global citizen could be volunteering for a non-profit organization that works towards improving the lives of marginalized communities. On the other hand, not applying an ethical obligation of a global citizen could be ignoring or denying the impact of climate change and failing to take actions to reduce our carbon footprint.</p><p></p><p>Overall, becoming a global citizen is a lifelong journey that requires continuous learning and growth, and a commitment to promoting a more just, sustainable, and peaceful world.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            10. In 250-300 words, write a descriptive essay on global citizenship with emphasis on what it meantto be a citizen of the world.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Defining global citizenship is not as easy as it may seem. According to Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, the term "global" is defined as "covering or affecting the whole world." The term "citizenship" is defined as "the legal right to belong to a particular country," "the state of being citizen and accepting the responsibilities of it." Putting together the two definitions "global citizenship" would mean, the legal right to belong to a particular country, here the whole world and the state of being citizen (of the world), and accepting the responsibilities of it. Well, that was easy, at least theoretically, it was.Applied to the global context, it is the legal right to belong to the world. If this is easy for a country, there is no legal right, tangible and formal given to an individual as a global citizen. There are several requirements to be met before a citizenship of a country is granted. Here in the United States, for instance, citizenship is obtained by birth on American soil or outside America from American parents. Foreigners can be naturalized Americans, meaning to become American citizens by legal residency for more than five years, or by marrying an American, among other requirements. In France, another developed country, and in Togo, a small African nation and my native land, the requirements are more or less the same. For Saudi Arabia, a kingdom keen to protecting its cultural values, it is almost impossible to be a naturalized Saudi, even if one was born in the kingdom from foreign parents. From the above revelations, one question comes into my mind.Restricting Immigration Policies</p><p>Restrictive immigration policies stand as a major wall towards global citizenship as freedom to travel is breached. While it may have certain advantages, the disadvantages of such immigration policies cannot be overlooked. Here are a few:</p><p>Better Standard of Living</p><p>On an individual level, is that people are able to earn a lot more than in their native country and thus, have a better standard of living.</p><p></p><p>hope it helps</p><br />

                        <p>As a global citizen, I think at least <strong>four issues in the Philippines</strong> that I can do something about as a global citizen:</p><p>1. Mental health crisis</p><p>2. The Philippines congestion problem</p><p>3. Philippines employment issues</p><p>4. The Moro Ethnic Conflict on the Philippine Island of Mindanao</p><p></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Mental health crisis</strong></p><p>With the Philippines' public health system and work-related health insurance, only about 15 percent of that cost is covered by insurance. The rest, worth 450 million rupiah, he must pay himself. Many Filipinos are threatened with poverty because of the loss of their livelihoods or the high costs of falling ill with the coronavirus. Even if they recover from Covid-19, many are experiencing a mental health crisis due to the conditions and situation of the pandemic.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. The Philippines congestion problem</strong></p><p>The Philippines has a big job in overcoming the problem of congestion. Vehicle density is a daily sight, especially in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. Not only rush hour, crawling vehicles even occur during normal hours. So, Filipinos can start to switch from previously using private vehicles, switching to more comfortable public transportation and reaching urban areas.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Philippines employment issues</strong></p><p>The high economic growth over the past few years has not had a significant impact on the Philippines' employment problems. Last year, unemployment in this country reached 7%, while the underemployment rate was 20%. A strong industrial base, particularly in manufacturing, can generate a wide variety of jobs. However, manufacturing development in the Philippines has lagged behind that of the major countries in Southeast Asia.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. The Moro Ethnic Conflict on the Philippine Island of Mindanao</strong></p><p>One of the existing conflicts and the concern of many countries is the conflict that occurred in the Philippines, where this conflict has also been involved in disputes to seize power regionally and globally. Moro became a term for Muslims who lived on the islands by the Spanish who colonized the northern and central parts of the island in 1565.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>why does the philippines have only two seasons:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/28509269</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                        Yes, in the sense of having many personal experiences, ideologies, and tastes that are commonly identified with various parts of the world.

According to Diogenes Laërtios, someone once asked Diogenes of Sinope which city he was a citizen of.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Why is it Important to Study History?</p><p></p><p>We all live in the present and we plan for the future – but how do we understand where we’re going and what progress looks like? To know exactly where you’re going, you first need to understand where you have come from. For that, you need an appreciation of history.</p><p></p><p></p><p>History is one of the most respected and most valuable academic subjects your child will learn. This guide takes a deep dive into the importance of learning history at school, plus a few tips for studying it effectively.</p><p></p><p>secondary students pudong</p><p>Benefits of Studying History</p><p>Entire societies, and the individuals within them, benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of history. Here are six benefits your child will enjoy if they study history in school.</p><p></p><p>1. Develop an Understanding of the World  </p><p>Through history, we can learn how past societies, systems, ideologies, governments, cultures, and technologies were built, how they operated, and how they have changed. The rich history of the world helps us to paint a detailed picture of where we stand today.</p><p></p><p>Developing your knowledge of history means developing your knowledge of all these different aspects of life. Children can learn about the pillars upon which different civilizations were built, including cultures and people different from their own.</p><p></p><p>All this knowledge makes them more rounded people who are better prepared to learn in all their academic subjects.</p><p></p><p>2. Become a More Rounded Person</p><p>History is full of stories. Some are inspiring and uplifting; others are chaotic and immoral. Tap into the vivid realm of history, and there are many vital lessons your child needs to learn. They will study times of suffering and times of joy, and the lessons they learn here can then be applied to their own life experience.     </p><p></p><p>History also encourages a deeper understanding of difference. There are lessons, both good and bad, to be learned from the way our ancestors have interacted with other people who have different ways of living. In a modern world where inclusivity is embraced no matter your background, an understanding of how past societies have integrated is key to humanity improving in the future.</p><p></p><p>3. Understand Identity </p><p>Nations are made up of a collection of stories and legends. These stories shape the way we think about our country and our standing within it. History is where we learn about how great institutions are formed, and how they’ve contributed to where we are today.</p><p></p><p>For many of us, looking back at incredible fellow countrymen is a way of establishing our own identity. Finding who we are and what mark we can make on the world is a huge part of childhood. Allowing children to learn about the identity of their country is one way of facilitating that.</p><p></p><p>4. Become Inspired </p><p>Those historical stories can also serve to inspire individuals to greatness. History remembers brilliant people and their heroic acts that have changed the shape of nations. You get a huge amount of motivation from learning about the inspirational events that make up where we are today.</p><p></p><p>It only takes one great story from the pages of history to light up children’s imagination and spur them on to do great things.</p><p></p><p>5. Learn from Mistakes </p><p>“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” George Santayana’s quote is one of academia’s most cited and paraphrased lines, and one that explains perfectly why everyone should study history. The past is filled with warning signs. We must be able to reflect on the events that built up to them, learn from mistakes made, and resist and question if we see similar patterns emerging.</p><p></p><p>If your child studies history, they will be able to identify when society is going down perilous routes and contribute towards getting it back on track.</p><p></p><p>6. Develop Transferrable Skills  </p><p>History is a respected academic pursuit that challenges our intellect. Students must analyse information that may not have one clear interpretation before offering a balanced conclusion. Critical thought is at the heart of every challenging intellectual pursuit.</p><p></p><p>The ability to question and evaluate information is one that applies to workplaces in many industries, and Nord Anglia Education strive to provide the necessary transferrable skills to all our students. History is one of the best subjects for stimulating and developing this ability.</p><br />

                            24. 300 word form the poem Rules for citizen by jeet Thayil</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The one speaking in the poem is generally assessed as an agent of the state. Since the voice is seemingly authoritarian.  
</p><p>
</p><p>Self-censorship is the act of censoring or classifying one's own discourse. This is done out of fear of, or deference to, the sensibilities or preferences (actual or perceived) of others and without overt pressure from any specific party or institution of authority.
</p><p>
</p><p>It is a mean to assert force and authority.
</p><p>
</p><p>The idea with the rules is tyrannical. It sounds that it is commanding the citizens that their freedom of thought shall not be exercised. If government tries to control what you think and how you behave, this is to preempt the citizens’ right to speak out or complain about the abuses of the state.  
</p><p>
</p><p>My reaction while reading this is chilling. This is because we know what follows ahead with tyrannical statements as this. There comes power tripping, control, corruption, and hidden crimes.  
</p><p>
</p><p>After all, there is a reason why tyranny now has a very negative connotation. Firstly, due to the fact that tyrants always takes the power of the powerful aristocrats, they are obviously not big fans of them so they create propaganda against the tyrants and do what they can to drag their name through the mud and get them kicked out.  Secondly, the second generation was never the same as the first. The second generation of tyrants was mainly considered to be spoilt and unsuitable to govern, as they tended to be less experienced, knowledgeable, rash and harsh.  The second generation of citizens tended to be against tyranny as it was considered to jeopardise all of their freedom.  Thirdly, tyrants were people who took control without the permission of the city states people and often a tyrant was someone or a group of people that was set up by an outside populous that is trying to control them and how much power they have.
