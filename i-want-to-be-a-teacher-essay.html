All my life I have loved doing many things, but only a few amazing things have turned into big goals that have made me the person I am today.
	One of these amazing goals is in TKD. I have enjoyed doing TKD since I was in the kinder garden. I enjoy TKD because it has taught me honesty, integrity, perseverance, self-control, an indomitable spirit, and most importantly confidence. The dojang has taught me self-defense obviously, and I have stuck to it for many years. It is important to me because the people there have kept me going. Also, it is a very fun sport to do. With all of this information, I think you can conclude that this sport is very important to me. Since you probably understand now why I picked this sport. Even though I am very good and have my black belt, my journey will not stop there. I want to continue helping at the dojang, And go up in ranks. That is my current goal for TKD for now.</a>

	One of these amazing goals is in TKD. I have enjoyed doing TKD since I was in the kinder garden. I enjoy TKD because it has taught me honesty, integrity, perseverance, self-control, an indomitable spirit, and most importantly confidence. The dojang has taught me self-defense obviously, and I have stuck to it for many years. It is important to me because the people there have kept me going. Also, it is a very fun sport to do. With all of this information, I think you can conclude that this sport is very important to me. Since you probably understand now why I picked this sport. Even though I am very good and have my black belt, my journey will not stop there. I want to continue helping at the dojang, And go up in ranks. That is my current goal for TKD for now.</h2><br />

I also gained knowledge about the planets, food, and vegetation. And I've learnt a ton about both nature and the nations I genuinely adore. But it's different. My habit of rushing,opening my gadget, getting up early to complete my modules,was like making you healthier throughout the break. You are fr-ee to nap whenever you choose. Deadlines and timetables won't cause you worry. I'm happy that our professors allowed us a break from schoolwork since I can't really convey how much I appreciated the holiday.</p><p></p><br />
