                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>5 Ways to Engage with Your Social Media Followers</p><p>Consider five ways to engage or initiate interaction on social media with your followers.</p><p></p><p>Be a Storyteller</p><p>Of course, there’s a time and place for direct, fact-based content such as when describing products and services. Yet, especially in the relaxed atmosphere of social media, it’s often more appropriate to use more emotional elements. Like what? Stories—whether internal experiences from team members or external ones from customers.</p><p></p><p>Storytelling brings your brand to life, giving people a glimpse into what you’re all about, what you value, what you work hard to achieve or solve, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Be Personable</p><p>While still being professional, you also want to inject a little fun and personality into your communication. This goes for captions and text, as well as replies to comments. How can you exude light, positive vibes?</p><p></p><p>By using emojis, GIFs, trending hashtags, and current language that’s popular amongst your audience.</p><p></p><p>Conduct Polls and Surveys</p><p>One way to encourage people to engage and to show your approachability is to ask questions. Questions about what? Likes, dislikes, opinions, knowledge.</p><p></p><p>While your polls and surveys shouldn’t be overly serious or always for the purpose of gathering info, you can actually learn quite a lot about your audience from the responses you receive. You can then use these insights to further improve your social media marketing strategy.</p><p></p><p>Use Video</p><p>Perhaps even leveraging what you learn through your polls and surveys, you can create videos that will appeal to and excite your followers. For example, you could answer frequently asked questions using video.</p><p></p><p>With live video also growing in popularity, you can showcase your company culture, record industry-related events, share fun facts or give tutorials…all in real-time. Humans—visual creatures that we are—are very receptive to video. You can expect, then, that if you choose interesting subject matter, many will gladly tune in, perhaps even commenting on or sharing your videos.</p><p></p><p>Ask For User-Generated Content (UGC)</p><p>Reaching out to followers can prove effective since it shows customers that you value their opinions and experiences. You might ask for written or video testimonials, pictures that positively highlight your brand or other content that might be helpful to the rest of your audience.</p><p></p><p>How can you request user-generated content and get your followers excited to submit it? You could organize contests, use clever captions or even start a hashtag campaign. Don’t be afraid to get creative. It may encourage your followers to do the same, which could make your social media accounts that much more vibrant and authentic.</p><br />
