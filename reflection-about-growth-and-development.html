Global Migration
Migration is a key feature of our increasingly interconnected world. It has also become a
flashpoint for debate in many countries, which underscores the importance of understanding the
patterns of global migration and the economic impact that is created when people move across
the world’s borders. A new report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), People on the
move: Global migration’s impact and opportunity, aims to fill this need.
Refugees might be the face of migration in the media, but 90 percent of the world’s 247 million
migrants have moved across borders voluntarily, usually for economic reasons. Voluntary
migration flows are typically gradual, placing less stress on logistics and on the social fabric of
destination countries than refugee flows. Most voluntary migrants are working-age adults, a
characteristic that helps raise the share of the population that is economically active in
destination countries.
By contrast, the remaining 10 percent are refugees and asylum seekers who have fled to another
country to escape conflict and persecution. Roughly half of the world’s 24 million refugees are in
the Middle East and North Africa, reflecting the dominant pattern of flight to a neighboring
country. But the recent surge of arrivals in Europe has focused the developed world’s attention
on this issue. A companion report, Europe’s new refugees: A road map for better integration
outcomes, examines the challenges and opportunities confronting individual countries
While some migrants travel long distances from their origin countries, most migration still
involves people moving to neighboring countries or to countries in the same part of the world
(exhibit). About half of all migrants globally have moved from developing to developed
countries—indeed, this is the fastest-growing type of movement. Almost two-thirds of the
world’s migrants reside in developed countries, where they often fill key occupational shortages.
From 2000 to 2014, immigrants contributed 40 to 80 percent of labor-force growth in major
destination countries.</a>

                                            The International Year of Rice: Background and History Rice is life for major populations of the world and is deeply embedded in the cultural heritage of many societies. It is the staple food for more than half of the world population. In Asia alone, more than 2,000 million people obtain 60 to 70 percent of their caloric intake from rice and its products. It is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa, and is of significant importance to food security in an increasing number of low-income food-deficit countries. Rice-based production systems and their associated post-harvest operations employ nearly 1,000 million people in rural areas of developing countries. About four-fifths of the world’s rice is grown by small-scale farmers in low-income and developing countries. It follows that efficient and productive rice-based production systems are essential for economic development and for improved quality of life of much of the world’s population. It is estimated that there are about 840 million undernourished people, including more than 200 million children, in developing countries. Undernourishment greatly limits development. Improving the productivity of rice systems would contribute to hunger eradication, poverty alleviation, national food security and economic development. However, rice production is facing serious constraints including a declining rate of growth in yields, depletion of natural resources, labour shortages, gender-based conflicts, institutional limitations and environmental pollution. Overcoming hunger, poverty and malnutrition - while protecting the environment - requires collective action by all stakeholders. The initiative for establishing an IYR commenced in 1999 when the International Rice Research Institute, reflecting the growing concerns of its members over an increasing number of serious issues facing rice development, requested and obtained FAO collaboration in having an International Year declared. This was pursued by FAO Member Countries leading to a resolution, adopted at the 31st session of the FAO Conference (Resolution 2/2001) requesting the UNGA to declare 2004 as the IYR. The request, submitted to the UNGA by the Delegation of the Philippines and co-sponsored by an additional 43 countries, was considered at the Fifty-seventh session, which declared 2004 the International Year of Rice (Box 1). FAO was invited to facilitate the implementation of the IYR in collaboration with other relevant organizations. The importance that member states are giving to sustainable rice development is reflected in a growing number of global initiatives. These include those taken at the 1992 Rio Summit and elaborated in Agenda 21’s chapter on Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD), at the recent World Conference on Sustainable Development, in the Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and in the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 1996 (Box 2). These initiatives share a common theme that is central to the declaration of the IYR: in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential.QUESTIONS:1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Self-Confidence and Performance</p><p>Self-confidence is considered one of the most influential motivators and regulators of behavior in people's everyday lives (Bandura, 1986). A growing body of evidence suggests that one's perception of ability or self-confidence is the central mediating construct of achievement strivings (e.g., Bandura, 1977; Ericsson et al., 1993; Harter, 1978; Kuhl, 1992; Nicholls, 1984). Ericsson and his colleagues have taken the position that the major influence in the acquisition of expert performance is the confidence and motivation to persist in deliberate practice for a minimum of 10 years.</p><p></p><p>Self-confidence is not a motivational perspective by itself. It is a judgment about capabilities for accomplishment of some goal, and, therefore, must be considered within a broader conceptualization of motivation that provides the goal context. Kanfer (1990a) provides an example of one cognitively based framework of motivation for such a discussion. She suggests that motivation is composed of two components: goal choice and self-regulation. Self-regulation, in turn, consists of three related sets of activities: self-monitoring, self-evaluation, and self-reactions. Self-monitoring provides information about current performance, which is then evaluated by comparing that performance with one's goal. The comparison between performance and goal results in two distinct types of self-reactions: self-satisfaction or -dissatisfaction and self-confidence expectations. Satisfaction or dissatisfaction is an affective response to past actions; self-confidence expectations are judgments about one's future capabilities to attain one's goal. This framework allows a discussion of self-confidence as it relates to a number of motivational processes, including setting goals and causal attributions.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sa wekapidea kopo yan kinuha basahin nyo nalang po</p><p></p><br />

Global Migration
Migration is a key feature of our increasingly interconnected world. It has also become a
flashpoint for debate in many countries, which underscores the importance of understanding the
patterns of global migration and the economic impact that is created when people move across
the world’s borders. A new report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), People on the
move: Global migration’s impact and opportunity, aims to fill this need.
Refugees might be the face of migration in the media, but 90 percent of the world’s 247 million
migrants have moved across borders voluntarily, usually for economic reasons. Voluntary
migration flows are typically gradual, placing less stress on logistics and on the social fabric of
destination countries than refugee flows. Most voluntary migrants are working-age adults, a
characteristic that helps raise the share of the population that is economically active in
destination countries.
By contrast, the remaining 10 percent are refugees and asylum seekers who have fled to another
country to escape conflict and persecution. Roughly half of the world’s 24 million refugees are in
the Middle East and North Africa, reflecting the dominant pattern of flight to a neighboring
country. But the recent surge of arrivals in Europe has focused the developed world’s attention
on this issue. A companion report, Europe’s new refugees: A road map for better integration
outcomes, examines the challenges and opportunities confronting individual countries
While some migrants travel long distances from their origin countries, most migration still
involves people moving to neighboring countries or to countries in the same part of the world
(exhibit). About half of all migrants globally have moved from developing to developed
countries—indeed, this is the fastest-growing type of movement. Almost two-thirds of the
world’s migrants reside in developed countries, where they often fill key occupational shortages.
From 2000 to 2014, immigrants contributed 40 to 80 percent of labor-force growth in major
destination countries.</h2><br />

                            17. The International Year of Rice: Background and History Rice is life for major populations of the world and is deeply embedded in the cultural heritage of many societies. It is the staple food for more than half of the world population. In Asia alone, more than 2,000 million people obtain 60 to 70 percent of their caloric intake from rice and its products. It is the most rapidly growing source of food in Africa, and is of significant importance to food security in an increasing number of low-income food-deficit countries. Rice-based production systems and their associated post-harvest operations employ nearly 1,000 million people in rural areas of developing countries. About four-fifths of the world’s rice is grown by small-scale farmers in low-income and developing countries. It follows that efficient and productive rice-based production systems are essential for economic development and for improved quality of life of much of the world’s population. It is estimated that there are about 840 million undernourished people, including more than 200 million children, in developing countries. Undernourishment greatly limits development. Improving the productivity of rice systems would contribute to hunger eradication, poverty alleviation, national food security and economic development. However, rice production is facing serious constraints including a declining rate of growth in yields, depletion of natural resources, labour shortages, gender-based conflicts, institutional limitations and environmental pollution. Overcoming hunger, poverty and malnutrition - while protecting the environment - requires collective action by all stakeholders. The initiative for establishing an IYR commenced in 1999 when the International Rice Research Institute, reflecting the growing concerns of its members over an increasing number of serious issues facing rice development, requested and obtained FAO collaboration in having an International Year declared. This was pursued by FAO Member Countries leading to a resolution, adopted at the 31st session of the FAO Conference (Resolution 2/2001) requesting the UNGA to declare 2004 as the IYR. The request, submitted to the UNGA by the Delegation of the Philippines and co-sponsored by an additional 43 countries, was considered at the Fifty-seventh session, which declared 2004 the International Year of Rice (Box 1). FAO was invited to facilitate the implementation of the IYR in collaboration with other relevant organizations. The importance that member states are giving to sustainable rice development is reflected in a growing number of global initiatives. These include those taken at the 1992 Rio Summit and elaborated in Agenda 21’s chapter on Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD), at the recent World Conference on Sustainable Development, in the Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and in the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 1996 (Box 2). These initiatives share a common theme that is central to the declaration of the IYR: in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential.QUESTIONS:1.

                        <p></p><p></p><p>As human beings, we all have personal qualities that we would like to cultivate and develop to become better versions of ourselves. Whether it's kindness, perseverance, or humility, the desire to improve ourselves is inherent in our nature. However, it's not enough to simply list these qualities; we must also create a plan for growth to develop them.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, it's essential to reflect on why we desire to cultivate these personal qualities. Is it for personal fulfillment, or to benefit those around us? Understanding the motivation behind our desire to grow is critical to creating an effective plan.</p><p></p><p>Once we've identified our motivations, we can then begin to identify the steps we need to take to develop these qualities. For example, if we want to cultivate kindness, we can start by performing small acts of kindness towards others, such as giving compliments or helping someone in need. Over time, these small acts can become habits, leading to a more significant overall shift in our behavior.</p><p></p><p>It's also important to recognize that personal growth is a continuous process. We must remain committed to our plan, even in the face of setbacks and challenges. The road to personal growth is not always easy, but with dedication and perseverance, we can achieve our goals.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, cultivating personal qualities is an essential aspect of being human.
