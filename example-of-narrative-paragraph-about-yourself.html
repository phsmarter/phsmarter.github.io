                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Though certain things in my life have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, I would say I have so far been one of the lucky people who has not been too negatively affected.</p><p></p><p>Currently, no one dear to me has been infected and hopefully that does not change in the days following this publication. Those in my life who are especially at risk have been practicing social distancing and staying in their homes, as everyone should continue to do.</p><p></p><p>I have been fortunate enough to still be able to make an income. My two campus jobs moved online, and though I’m grateful to still be able to earn money through them, my hours have suffered. Luckily, I work for a veterinary clinic, which is an essential business, and with the cancellation of on-campus classes and sports, I have been able to work more shifts there.</p><p></p><p>However, as it is with everyone, I still have been impacted by the measurements we all have had to take to avoid spreading this virus.</p><p></p><p>As a student-athlete, the sport of track and field has been a huge part of my everyday life for the past several years. COVID-19 took away my senior outdoor track and field season. Though the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) has given all seniors another season of eligibility, I’m still unsure as to whether I will be able to take advantage of that since I’m set to graduate this spring.</p><p></p><p>Though running is still an available form of exercise, recent injuries have prevented me from being able to run too much or too hard. The closure of weight rooms prevents me from being able to lift, which is one of my favorite activities to do. I have often used lifting as an outlet for any built-up frustration, but now I’m unable to do that even though I could certainly use it.</p><p></p><p>I have applied for an EOU Master’s degree, but unless I get a graduate assistant (GA) position, I might not be able to go through with the program due to costs. As of right now, I have no idea what will happen. If I am unable to join the Master’s program, then I won’t be able to compete in uniform. I may never get the chance to achieve and surpass the goals I had for myself.</p><p></p><p>The pandemic has also prevented me from being able to travel. It has always been my dream to visit other countries. My parents and I were going to take a trip to Europe this summer. I was extremely excited and having to postpone the trip was quite devastating for me. I’m grateful that it was only postponed until next year and not cancelled entirely.</p><p></p><p>Even through all the negative things that have happened, there has been a silver lining. With the cancellation of sports and a light class load, I have gotten to spend more time with my dog. I was even able to bring home a foster dog that I have been working with. Either my roommate or I will adopt her, though we have yet to talk that out. Though it may be difficult at times, it’s important to keep your head up and remember that this won’t go on forever. Make the best of it in any way that you can</p><br />

                            7. Write a brief narrative about yourself, portraying personnel and moi?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I am sentimental, out-going, indecisive, understanding, curious, naive, lazy, and young. I want to be ... , well a lot of things, and growing is discovering what they are. I feel people cannot see the potential within, although there is no one to blame but myself. I look to others for approval instead of to myself. I aim to please; it leads to approval. I don’t like to discuss my faults; I pity myself.</p><p></p><p>I am weak in some respects, but in others I am strong. My life is a balance of ups and downs. With my extremes however, my scales never fulfill the word "balance." The ups and downs equal a median on which I travel daily. I love those who understand me, who chose to come close to the fire, who stay long enough to love its warmth, and who know how to avoid being burned. I don’t trust people easily. I don’t throw around my heart. I’ve lost love from my lack of giving. I regret this.</p><p></p><p>I grab hold of things, always seeking support, a rock on which to lean. I have tried God, boyfriends, and small successes in school and sports, feeling the title FAILURE rise upon my forehead when I slipped. Afterwards I tried even harder to bring myself back up, my recovery taken on the quickest, most unstable route. This explains how I fell so easily. The self-esteem I had needed to be constantly replenished and refilled. My source was not myself, but others, whose opinions mattered more than my own.</p><p></p><p>I am passionate and at times fearless. I am everything, and I am nothing. I am ever-changing and unpredictable. I crave security but cry for independence. I am black or white, never gray. My actions may not reflect my feelings and vice-versa.

                        <p>A literacy narrative is a personal story about one's relationship with reading and writing. Here are three paragraphs of a literacy narrative about a famous novel:</p><p></p><p>Growing up, I was never much of a reader. I struggled with comprehension and often found myself bored with the books assigned in school. However, everything changed when I discovered "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee. This novel opened my eyes to the power of storytelling and the importance of empathy. I was captivated by the characters and their struggles, and I found myself invested in their lives. Reading this book was a turning point for me, and it sparked a love of literature that has stayed with me to this day.</p><p></p><p>As I grew older, I began to appreciate "To Kill a Mockingbird" on a deeper level. I realized that the novel was not just a story about racism and injustice, but also a commentary on the human condition. The characters in the book are flawed and complex, and they grapple with issues that are still relevant today. I was struck by how Lee was able to capture the nuances of human behavior and create a world that felt both familiar and foreign. Reading this book taught me the power of literature to challenge our assumptions and broaden our perspectives.</p><p></p><p>Today, "To Kill a Mockingbird" remains one of my favorite novels. I have read it countless times, and each time I discover something new. This book has taught me so much about the world and myself, and it has inspired me to become a better writer and reader. I am grateful for the impact that "To Kill a Mockingbird" has had on my life, and I will always cherish the memories of reading it for the first time.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>While it is true a narrative is a story, there is more in the telling of the story. The narrative, or story, needs to make the reader feel involved, teach a lesson, help get an idea across, or feel emotionally about it. The narrative needs to explain who is in the story, tell what is happening, and when it happened. The topic sentence needs to be clear so the reader knows they are going to learn something from the story. The story itself is written in time, or chronological order, as the events occured.~ Mary M.</p><p></p><p>Common Transitional expressions used in a narrative paragraph are after, finally, soon, as (soon as), later, then, before, meanwhile, upon, during, next, when, first, now, and while.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>A good way to plan for a well developed paragraph is to write out a topic sentence, then write events in chronological order and then write a conclusion.

One summer, we went to a remote campsite that was surrounded by lush trees and a serene lake. On the second day of our trip, my siblings and I decided to go on a hike to explore the area. As we were walking, we suddenly heard a rustling in the bushes nearby. We froze, not knowing what it could be. Suddenly, a curious little fox poked its head out of the bushes and looked up at us. We were all amazed by the sight and slowly approached the fox, which didn't seem to be afraid of us. For the next few minutes, we watched in awe as the fox played and chased its tail right in front of us. It was an unforgettable experience that we still talk about to this day."</p><p></p><p>This paragraph is a narrative text because it tells a story, including details about the setting, the characters, and a specific event that happened.

(Sec. 2, RA 10627) These acts are collectively called “cyber bullying” when committed online. (Sec. 2-D, RA 10627) This covers social bullying aiming to belittle another individual or group or gender-based bullying that humiliates another on the basis of perceived or actual sexual orientation and gender identity. (Sec. 3, B-1, RA 10627, Implementing Rules).</p><br />

                        <p>Hi, there! I cannot give you a direct answer because this may encourage plagiarism. What I can do is give you some guiding questions on how your homework can have some structure.</p><p>Since the homework is about another person, your best friend, it will be very easy to write about it. A best friend is someone you know well and who also knows a lot about you.</p><p>Since it is a narrative, you can choose to write about a certain experience that you and your best friend shared. It may be a cherished memory like the following: </p>first time you met each otherthe first time you visited each other's homethe time you realized why this person is the best friend you will ever havethe time that your best friend helped you through a very painful experiencethe first time you travelled with your best friendor it may even be about the first time you fought but got back together<p>A narrative can be one of the easiest paragraphs to write because the first thing you have to do is to look back on the memory and remember the details. Next thing you do is to find the words to describe each scene and the feelings that you both had during those moments. You may even add in adjectives or adverbs about the things around you and how one has acted.</p><br />

There are good study habits and there are bad study habits, and this article is going to show you how to ditch what’s not working and focus on strategies that will work and make a difference come test day. When you’re finished, you’ll know how to study smarter, not harder. Plus, you’ll have a few tricks up your sleeve for when you need that extra boost of motivation!</p><p></p><p>*Create a study space.</p><p>Set up your study space. It’s great if you have a desk for studying, but a table will also work great. Make sure your space has good lighting and remove any clutter or distractions that might break your focus. </p><p></p><p>*Create a schedule.</p><p>Create a daily study schedule for yourself. Rather than trying to do all your studies in 1 day, plan to study a little every day. Start by choosing the time of day when you feel the most focused. Then, decide which subjects you’ll study each day. Keep your study schedule in your agenda or somewhere you can see it every day.</p><p></p><p>*Organize your materials.</p><p>Organize your study materials so it's easy to find what you need. You probably have a lot to do, so you need to spend your time wisely. Keep all of your papers, notebooks, texts, and writing utensils in a specific place so you don’t waste precious study time looking for them. This way you can quickly pull out what you need and get started.</p><p></p><p>*Remove distractions.</p><p>Remove distractions so you can stay focused on your studies. You’ll have an easier time focusing if there aren’t distractions around. Ask the people around you to not disturb you while you’re studying. Additionally, turn off your TV and silence your phone so you won’t be tempted to check it.</p><p></p><p>*Review your notes.</p><p>Review your notes at the end of each school day so everything is fresh. You'll likely need to re-read your notes a few times before they start to stick in your mind. Set aside a few minutes every day to go back over what you learned in all of your classes. It doesn't need to be a big block of time</p><p></p><p>*Create a study guide.</p><p>Rewrite your notes with extra information to create a study guide. Making a study guide helps you review the material and gives you something to review in future study sessions. Start by typing your notes into a blank document. Then, use your textbook and online resources to add to your existing notes. Additionally, answer questions from your textbook or ones that come to mind as you study</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>summariz</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>n</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong><strong> </strong><strong>^</strong><strong>^</strong></p><br />

We were really happy going on a trip with them. Me and my brother were super excited upon that, but that’s where things go wrong. We were going to Fairy Meadows. It’s a place in Bihar. So were actually going there by the train. The two other families like mine and theirs family booked a room in the train so that we can sleep easily. At that time I was like obsessed with chocolates. Well so we bought our own food while they bought theirs. We still shared the food. The train stopped at a particular station and I asked my dad that if he can go and buy me some chocolates. So my brother and my father went out of the train to get me some chocolates that’s when things actually start to go wrong. while they were coming back the train almost left them behind. Whilethey were coming the train started to go. When they saw this and they ran as fast as they could and reached toward me or maybe us. Well the story isn’t finished yet. I started to eat the chocolates as soon as my father brought them. Well I didn’t even eat half of them when I stopped eating so that I can use them later in my trip( inside the train). As it was a long way to go. After a couple of hours we felt a bit tired so we decided to go to sleep. While I went to sleep I don’t know when one of our friends came into our room and they took our chocolates with them. When I got up I was so hungry when I leaned towards the table to take my chocolates I couldn’t find them. I looked every where in the room but couldn’t find it any ways that is when I thought that maybe I should ask my friends. As soon as I entered in their room I saw them eating our chocolates and you know what’s the most interesting part they ate them all and were about to eat the two last ones. That’s when me and my brother took the chocolates form them.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>essay </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Camillus’s Religious and Non-religious Arguments</p><p>Topic: Religion</p><p>Words: 151 </p><p>Mar 25th, 2022</p><p></p><p>After the devastating attacks of the Gauls, the Romans wanted to leave the city and immigrate to Veii. Camillus, as a “Romulus and as the father of his country and second founder of the city,” developed a powerful speech (Livy 395). Using non-religious arguments, Camillus remembered the time when Romans tried to abandon the unharmed city and explained it as “victory, glorious for us and for our posterity” (Livy 401). Now, leaving the city was “pitiful and shameful for us, but glorious for the Gauls” because the Romans must go “not as victors but as vanquished men who have lost their city” (Livy 401). However, his religious arguments had a stronger impact because Camillus underlined the worth of ancestors, priests, “sacred rites and temples” (Livy 400). Even if the Romans thought that gods turned away, they should not interrupt their worship but restore the land and obtain gods’ grace and support.</p><p></p><br />

                            30. narrative paragraph about face to face learning</h2><br />
                        <p> </p><p>Face to face learning, also known as traditional classroom learning, involves students physically attending classes and interacting directly with their teachers and peers. In this learning approach, students can ask questions and receive immediate feedback from their instructors, which can help them better understand complex topics. Additionally, face to face learning allows for group discussions and collaboration, which can enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills. It also provides students with a structured routine, helping them stay focused and motivated. Furthermore, face to face learning provides opportunities for socialization, allowing students to build relationships with their peers and expand their network. Overall, face to face learning is a valuable educational approach that provides students with a rich and engaging learning experience.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />
