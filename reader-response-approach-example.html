                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Title: "My Heart Leaps Up"</p><p></p><p>Author: William Wordsworth</p><p></p><p>Description: "My Heart Leaps Up" is a short poem written by William Wordsworth in 1802. The poem is also known as "The Rainbow" and was inspired by the beauty of nature. The poem reflects Wordsworth's belief in the importance of connecting with nature and the joy that it can bring to our lives.</p><p></p><p>Thesis Statement: In "My Heart Leaps Up," Wordsworth celebrates the beauty and power of nature and emphasizes the importance of having a deep connection with the natural world.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>As a reader, my reaction to "My Heart Leaps Up" is one of awe and wonder at the beauty of nature that Wordsworth describes. The poem begins with the lines "My heart leaps up when I behold, A rainbow in the sky," which immediately evokes a sense of joy and excitement at the sight of such a magnificent natural phenomenon. Wordsworth goes on to describe how he has felt this way since he was a child, and how even now as an adult, he still finds joy and inspiration in nature.</p><p></p><p>What strikes me about this poem is the way that Wordsworth is able to capture the essence of the natural world in such a simple and elegant way. His use of language is both vivid and evocative, and it creates a powerful image in the mind of the reader. For example, when he says "The rainbow comes and goes, And lovely is the rose," he is able to convey the transience and beauty of nature in just a few words.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><br />
