                                            "The Duplicate War: A Review" by David Lowe
Critique by Robert Keating
(1) The most valuable portion of any critique is "What I didn't like and why." (2) Unfortunately, there's not much
wrong with The Duplicate War: A Review. (3)I will try to be as specific as possible with my praise, so you'll know
what you did right.
(4) The vehicle of an opera review to tell your tale is an excellent one. (5)1 have seen this approach before, and it is
very effective as long as it keeps moving. (6) Your tale moved at a brisk (but not rushed) pace.
(7) "The photograph of his father in the wheelchair that had brought him back from Vietnam could be dusted..." (8)
The paragraph this line appears in is an excellent example of characterization by setting, and the line I referenced
is the wonderful little which completes the scene and sheds a little light on who Scott is.
(9) "The networks showed the tape over and over, he sat up drinking strong coffee and watched Michael every
hour until dawn." (10)I think that amending this line to end"... and watched Michael die every hour until dawn" will
add impact and help justify Scott's actions later.
(11) This is an excellent story and should see publication. (12) It is on par with what I see in the short science
fiction markets.

When we assess the state of the world, and identify looming challenges like climate change, global pandemics, security threats and diminishing resources, we don't hesitate in turning to science to gauge the problems and find solutions. And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hovering on the horizon-stem cells, genomic sequencing, personalized medicine, longevity research, nanoscience, brain-machine interface, quantum computers, space technology-we realize how crucial it is to cultivate a general public that can engage with scientific issues; there's simply no other way that as a society we will be prepared to make informed decisions on a range of issues that will shape the future.

AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by
aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 
percent.
Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. “Overtaking on the left” 
appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it 
relates to aggressive driving. “Improper lane change,” ”running stop sign,” 
and “running red light” rank second through four in terms of their 
contribution to fatalities.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>According to Lowe, knowledge requires a form of action to be accurate and precise. In other words, knowledge is created on the basis of a rationally conceived design such as an experiment. Experiments are a great example of how action is required to produce or replicate knowledge.  Moreover, one necessitates research and a rational design to attain certainty in his or her knowledge claim. Generally, this certainty may be achieved with an experiment. Natural sciences may be referred to as a science of the physical world, whereas a social science may be defined as a branch of science dealing with human society and relationships. Furthermore, social sciences and natural science may be distinguished by the method of their creation. </p><br />

                            5. "The Duplicate War: A Review" by David Lowe
Critique by Robert Keating
(1) The most valuable portion of any critique is "What I didn't like and why." (2) Unfortunately, there's not much
wrong with The Duplicate War: A Review. (3)I will try to be as specific as possible with my praise, so you'll know
what you did right.
(4) The vehicle of an opera review to tell your tale is an excellent one. (5)1 have seen this approach before, and it is
very effective as long as it keeps moving. (6) Your tale moved at a brisk (but not rushed) pace.
(7) "The photograph of his father in the wheelchair that had brought him back from Vietnam could be dusted..." (8)
The paragraph this line appears in is an excellent example of characterization by setting, and the line I referenced
is the wonderful little which completes the scene and sheds a little light on who Scott is.
(9) "The networks showed the tape over and over, he sat up drinking strong coffee and watched Michael every
hour until dawn." (10)I think that amending this line to end"... and watched Michael die every hour until dawn" will
add impact and help justify Scott's actions later.
(11) This is an excellent story and should see publication. (12) It is on par with what I see in the short science
fiction markets.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Thinking about our future, it has always been ourselves we keep revolving on. Feeling things and making our lives dramatic was all we care about that we tend to forget being mindful in our environment. Now think about the heroes you admired when you are still a child, this beings have supernatural powers and they save the world by just flying everywhere and finding the supposed to be their supervillain. We think it would be awesome to be someone like this being and have power to eliminate anyone and save others from any dangers they have encountered to. However, we don't need to be someone like that where they would wait for their powers that would be bestowed into them. We are already have power enough to make a move today and create change. Even though, we start as an individuals to make an action but you can have networks in many people as much as possible. Our mother earth was always been our home. Even with its cruelty of reality, do not make it your enemy as if it has something to do with you when we are the ones responsible for our actions. Do something and start with yourself since we are not meant to save the world if we cannot even save ourselves. If we are falling and need a break, it is fine and try to confide with someone. Everyone of us need help from another and they are also the heroes in our lives. We just never try to notice and appreciate the people around us. We can also be our own heroes to another since just a share of kindness would be able to lift up someone. The world don't need saving, it needs love. Even with the improvement of science and breakthroughs of technology, it was still there, the abstract concept every one of us exchange in any kinds. The world needs love and it needs collaboration of every person in this planet as we can see that it was suffering from our selfishness and greed. We should use our knowledge of science and our works of improvement in our environment to solve every real world problems. We could make it possible and it always has been. We just forgot to see what was around us and was being blind by ourselves. Try to see it then, everything around you and feel it, then start making a change.</p><br />

Transportation is very important in our society especially in the rough times now in this pandemic to have a safe way to travel however the risks and problems to this are pollution and lack of human excercise, the reason I said these are risks from human transportation is because almost all our vehicles run on gas and they just destroy our environment and our health thanks to this gas and the lack of human excercise is because some people become too relying on these transportation that they begin to get lazy and then their body wont function the way it used to now having the difficulty of moving your body and the development of more body mass. </p><p></p><p>Sorry if it is too long you can edit this if you need to and I hope it helps</p><br />

When we consider the ubiquity of cellphones, iPods, personal computers and the internet, it's easy to see how science (and the technology to which it leads) in woven into the fabric of our day-to-day activities. When we benefit from CT scanners, M.R.1. devices, pacemakers and arterial atents, we can immediately appreciate how science affects the quality of our lives. When we assess the state of the world, and identify looming challenges like climate change, global pandemics, security threats and diminishing resources, we don't hesitate in turning to science to gauge the problems and find solutions. And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hovering on the horizon-stem cells, genomic sequencing, personalized medicine, longevity research, nanoscience, brain-machine interface, quantum computers, space technology-we realize how crucial it is to cultivate a general public that can engage with scientific issues; there's simply no other way that as a society we will be prepared to make informed decisions on a range of issues that will shape the future.

                            29. Read the essay carefully. Then, answer the questions that follow. 
 Circle the letter of the correct answer.
AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by
aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 
percent.
Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. “Overtaking on the left” 
appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it 
relates to aggressive driving. “Improper lane change,” ”running stop sign,” 
and “running red light” rank second through four in terms of their 
contribution to fatalities.
