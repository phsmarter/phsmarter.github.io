                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Learning in the new normal is a challenge for the teachers, students and even parents. After postponing the opening of online classes last August 24, DepEd now confirms that they are ready for October’s opening of classes, for the school year 2020 to 2021, through blended learning approaches after reaching more than 23 million enrollees. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Blended learning is a combination of both online and offline learning methodologies with the use of technology. Online is when the students study with their teacher and classmates through an application that uses a webcam while offline is when the teacher provides the students with the lesson, seatwork or assignment that they can finish at their own pace, within the deadline. All works are submitted and graded via online. </p><p></p><p>This new way of learning brought by COVID-19 pandemic can be an additional challenge during this tough time. And since going back to the “normal” we’re all accustomed to isn’t going to happen anytime soon, let’s all do the best we could to adjust and make this current situation work. Remember, the goal of online learning is to keep the students engaged academically in order to retain what they have learned</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The education of a society plays a crucial role in dictating the future and identity of the country as this valuable acquisition of knowledge has a great impact in the national development and stability of the economy. The provision of quality education and an ambient learning environment encourages the Filipino people to nurture and enhance their knowledge, potentials, and creativity. By providing quality education to the Filipino youth, we are enabling the youth of the nation to grow into globally competitive professionals, thus, offering the country with a better quality of living. </p><p></p><p>Before the Philippines broke away from their rule under Spain and the United States, their educational system was arranged according to their colonial powers. This radically changed after the Philippines carried off with their independence in 1946. The Philippines implemented a 10-year basic educational system composed of…show more content…</p><p>Cebu City National Science High School shall correspond its system to the new K to 12 educational program that is being implemented throughout the country.  The new K to 12 educational program is accompanied by a new curriculum where it implies that the mastery of academic concepts is not sufficient enough for young professionals to face the real world. Thus, the Department of Education or DepEd has incorporated media and technology skills, learning and innovation skills, effective communication skills, and life and career skills. Through this system, the Cebu City National Science High School shall be able to incorporate the new curriculum to the institution’s design and planning.  Unfortunately, the current facilities of the educational institution are not able to accommodate to the updated K to 12 program as more classrooms, laboratories, and ancillary rooms are related.</p><p>We should partake in things that we believe in and things that will contribute to our success. However, public education prepares you to become something you are not and grow out of your creativity. It gives you the false hope that what you have desire to become is something else because you were not taught in a way to prepare for you to exhibit yourself into the world. There are many things that is learned in school, but is soon realized on how eventually we can not use these life lessons in our lives. For example, a person who wants to be a musician is forced to intensely focus on science, math and English when it does not correspond to the musical field.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            5. Help me this. Essay What you think is the state of academic writing in the Philippines Education Context. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> The state of academic writing in the Philippines is mostly determined by the student's educational background as well as the school's resources. Based on our academic performance, there is a significant gap between the Philippine and American contexts. Filipinos' writing style has to be improved. Through a combination of detailed criticism, writing practice, and rigorous rewriting, we may overcome the challenges of writing academic papers.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Academic writing in science takes two forms, one, theses/dissertations, and two, manuscripts for the purpose of peer-reviewed publishing. Both not necessarily mutually exclusive. My five year stay in the Philippines was in academe. I found out more about the state of academic writing during this time than before I migrated. These are what I observed (not in all cases)</p><p></p><p>Graduate students in many universities find it hard to obtain a thesis topic</p><p>Theses and dissertation titles usually have parochial themes</p><p>Research results, not to mention, successfully defended theses (dissertations) are for the most part unpublished, they usually end up stacked in library shelves of the institution</p><p>When research results are submitted for publication in international peer-reviewed journals and get rejected, the authors usually do not submit to another journal, meaning they give up</p><p>University faculty are very aware of publishing research results, but they rarely publish; thus “publish or perish” does not apply. This means faculty can go on being a professor without publishing for years on end until retirement</p><p>Crab-mentality and subterfuge are alive and well in Philippine academe</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Academic writing is properly nested in schools. That is the proper place. The purpose is to train the mind of the student.</p><p></p><p>However, academic writing has become business to some people, and this is true the world over, not only in the Philippines. In these business outfits, hired writers do the academic writing for students for a fee. But it does not do the country good especially for the students concerned.</p><p>To talk about status of academic writing in the Philippines, you would have to look into sschools. Unfortunately, it is the business side of it that gets attention these days.</p><p></p><p>For my opinion why this topic is properly nested in education and not in business, please refer to my post here. Why you should write your own dissertation</p><p>Talking about thesis writing in the Philippines as compared to other countries, it is fair to say students in most schools in the country do thesis writing - not just projects. However, much depends upon the school. Newer schools are more lax when it comes to responsibility. The students merely do group projects.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My experience is limited. My own work is comprised of historically set fiction placing Americans in the islands and following them and my equally important Filipino characters as they interact during the troubled historical times they share. My main American characters tend to be sympathetic to the plight of the Filipinos during the United States' assault on the archipelago. During preparation, I found the Philippine academic resources equal in quality to the American ones and sometimes superior.</p><br />

                        Is Online Education Relevant to the Philippine System?<p></p><p><strong>Philippines is not prepared for online learning. </strong>According to the Department of Science and Technology, the Philippines ranks 83rd out of 183 countries in terms of digital readiness. This indicates that the Philippines is not technologically sophisticated (DOST).</p><p></p><p>During the quarantine in most of the Philippines, education officials have advocated using online platforms for the 2020-2021 school year to continue the education of millions of students. Online education offers virtual classes that a student can take at home alone or with a group via phone call or video conference using software such as Messenger, Google Zoom, or Skype. Online education necessitates the use of suitable technology, such as a smartphone that supports video calls and a stable internet connection.</p><p></p><p>However, the Philippines cannot support online education for the majority of its pupils, therefore the attempt will fail for the majority of the country. Due to poverty in the Philippines, not every family has the means to acquire the necessary equipment for online learning. These families simply cannot adapt to the needs of online learning and will be left behind or forced to find alternative means of education for their children if they are not provided with an alternative. In addition, internet speed in the Philippines is still bad, as our country's more than 7,000 islands make it impossible to build fixed networks. In addition, the process of constructing cell towers is arduous and time-consuming.</p><p></p><p>However, Online Education allows both the teacher and the student to set their own learning rate, as well as a schedule that accommodates everyone's schedule. In addition, it can assist us in being highly organized, self-motivated, and time-management savvy. Consequently, employing an online educational platform allows for a better work-study balance.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, <strong>the Philippines requires a clear set of regulations and norms based on an innovative educational system</strong>. This necessitates a thorough and serious evaluation of the nation's readiness to offer learning programs with rigorous criteria.

                            7. What are the Importance of home economics  Philippines education? Essay pahelp po please​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I strongly believe that home economics has an extremely important place in our educational system today. No other academic discipline incorporates in its curriculum as many pertinent life skills that will help students succeed independent of their chosen career paths. Referring back to past studies and my own personal beliefs, I hope to help the reader understand the benefits of receiving an education in home economics and how the knowledge obtained through this program will prove valuable throughout the lifespan.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, the most important aspect of a home economics education is that students not only learn about subject matter that has relevance to their present lives, but will constantly be of use as they continue to grow. One area of home economics that is considered to be among the most essential is the emphasis on personal development, decision making and intrapersonal skills. According to a study done in Japan, students’ personal initiatives play an extremely large role in determining how they’ll react to their changing work situations (1). Those who lack the ability to make effective personal decisions are more at risk for experiencing hardships in the instabilities found in the real world. It was also found in the study that students do not feel they have the proper means to learn these valuable life skills at home (1). Taking courses in home economics at school allows students to acquire the necessary decision making, social, and communications skills deemed critical for occupational success.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the development of valuable intrapersonal skills, the home economics curriculum also introduces the students to a wide variety of potential career paths. Students become aware of all the career opportunities relating to each domain, as well as being taught the skills associated with them. Those who find themselves intrigued by course material may begin to consider an occupation in a related area. The home economics discipline has led individuals to the fields of education, nutrition, social service, and hospitality management, to name a few (8). It is hard to find a single subject taught in schools today that incorporates as many topics of interest as home economics, helping students to become more well-rounded individuals.</p><p></p><p>Consumer-related material covered in home economics courses is another area that provides students with information pertinent to their lives as adults. These programs help supply the students with an understanding on how economic, social, and cultural factors personally affect them and their behaviors in consumerism (5). While other academic courses may cover theoretical aspects personal finance, home economics gives a more practical, everyday application of the subject matter. However, there have been some criticisms to how useful learning about consumerism as adolescents actually is. Research on Finnish students showed that motivation to study consumerism in school was not particularly high, because they felt true consumerism started at adulthood (2). Despite the attitudes of this sample, I do believe children in home economics programs can benefit from learning purchasing practices at a young age. Because of its real-world applications, students may find these techniques conducive to their everyday lives.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I HOPE IT'S HELP</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Having the knowledge of how to cook and manage aspects of a household through a class is vital in today’s society. Although many may think that a class isn’t needed to teach about the basic necessities, having a class solely devoted to these aspects is exactly what we need in school.</p><p></p><p>Things like learning how to make more than a grilled cheese or how to sew is something that everyone should learn at a young age.</p><p></p><p>In home economics, students develop an understanding of the factors that influence the well-being of individuals and families within the home and community and of the actions people take to enhance and sustain those environments. ... Many teachers of home economics are also teachers of food technology and hospitality.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> 3 pharagro essay ʕ´• ᴥ•̥`ʔ</p><p></p><br />

Formal education typically spans 14 years and is structured in a 6+4+4 system: 6 years of primary school education, 4 years of secondary school education, and 4 years of higher education, leading to a bachelor's degree.

                        The Philippine’s education system is managed by the Philippine department of education. It controls the general running of schools and colleges in the Philippines and controls the curriculum in the Philippine’s education system. It also details things such as how teachers are to be hired and what qualifications they should have. My sequence essay is based on the education of a person born in the Philippines. The country achieved independence in 1946, so before that time it was colonial powers that regulated education. Those colonial powers came from the USA and Spain. The education system changed radically since the country achieved independence. There are six years of compulsory elementary education. This starts at around the age of six and goes up to the age of 12. The date that classes start is the same across the country, though some holidays do vary. Still, the curriculum must start in all schools at the same time. This is probably because it means any exams happen at the same time across the country.<br />As a young person, you are required to start school at the age of six and keep working until you reach the age of 12. At that age, you may be able to stay at your current school for your High School education, or you may have to move to another school to get your High School education.<br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Science education in the Philippines is in a state of disrepair. The high-stakes testing culture and lack of resources for teaching science have resulted in poor performance on standardized tests and a lack of interest in the subject among students. There are also issues with the curriculum and teacher training. Schools lack the proper equipment and materials to effectively teach science, and there is a large gap between what is taught in the classroom and what is needed in the workplace. Additionally, the Philippines has one of the lowest student-to-teacher ratios and the lowest spending per student in the entire ASEAN region. </p><p></p><p>Overall, the condition of science education in the Philippines is dismal. With limited resources and inadequate teaching methods, students have difficulty understanding the concepts they need to be successful in their future careers. It is imperative that the government invest in science education in order to create an educated, productive workforce that can compete with the rest of the world. Only then will the Philippines be able to move forward and reach its full potential.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Yan Po short sana nakatulong </p><br />
