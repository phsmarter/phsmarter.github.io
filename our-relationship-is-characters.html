Focus on the labelled characters, both the numbered and lettered ones. 3.	Using the principle that characters must move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, indicate to which direction does every numbered character move. 4.	Locate the specific passageway (lettered character) for each numbered character by analyzing their relationships. Take note that no two characters can pass through the same pathway.   GUIDE QUESTIONS: 1.	Which are the two directions that the numbered characters are supposed to be transported to?  2.	What is the general structure in the picture that the characters need to pass through to be transferred to the other side? 3.	Identify the specific characters (lettered parts) which are designed to pass through the corresponding specific structures (numbered parts in the boundary). (Example: a to 1, b to 2,etc.)  4.	Which characters do not need a tool or gadget to enter and exit the boundary?  5.	How do you call this kind of transport? 6.	Which characters need a tool or gadget to enter and exit the boundary?  7.	 If you are to make an analogy between the picture and the cell, to which components of the cell will you liken the characters and the boundary?

Inequality between the genders is a phenomenon that goes back at least 4,000 years (Lerner 1986). Although the forms and ways in which it has been practiced differ between cultures and change significantly through history, its persistence has led to the formulation of the concept of patriarchy. Patriarchy refers to a set of institutional structures (like property rights, access to positions of power, relationship to sources of income) that are based on the belief that men and women are dichotomous and unequal categories. Key to patriarchy is what might be called the dominant gender ideology toward sexual differences: the assumption that physiological sex differences between males and females are related to differences in their character, behavior, and ability (i.e., their gender). These differences are used to justify a gendered division of social roles and inequality in access to rewards, positions of power, and privilege. The question that feminists ask therefore is: How does this distinction between male and female, and the attribution of different qualities to each, serve to organize our institutions (e.g., the family, law, the occupational structure, religious institutions, the division between public and private) and to perpetuate inequality between the sexes?

Inequality between the genders is a phenomenon that goes back at least 4,000 years (Lerner 1986). Although the forms and ways in which it has been practiced differ between cultures and change significantly through history, its persistence has led to the formulation of the concept of patriarchy. Patriarchy refers to a set of institutional structures (like property rights, access to positions of power, relationship to sources of income) that are based on the belief that men and women are dichotomous and unequal categories. Key to patriarchy is what might be called the dominant gender ideology toward sexual differences: the assumption that physiological sex differences between males and females are related to differences in their character, behavior, and ability (i.e., their gender). These differences are used to justify a gendered division of social roles and inequality in access to rewards, positions of power, and privilege. The question that feminists ask therefore is: How does this distinction between male and female, and the attribution of different qualities to each, serve to organize our institutions (e.g., the family, law, the occupational structure, religious institutions, the division between public and private) and to perpetuate inequality between the sexes?

Patriarchy is defined as institutional structures (like property rights, access to positions of power, relationship to sources of income) that are based on the belief that men and women are unequal. The basic assumption of patriarchy is that physiological sex differences between males and females are related to differences in their character, behavior, and ability. But, how does the distinction between male and female serve to organize our institutions and to perpetuate inequality between the sexes?</a>

KEY TERMS
YOUR VOICE, or your own perspective of the world, can affect the way you create your character’s world. The invitation is to make strange that which is familiar and make familiar that which is exotic. 
DETAIL adds to the meaning of your work. Know your setting fully, experience it mentally, and create it through significant detail. Every detail in your setting supports and impinges on your characters.
CONTEXT includes the societal norms and traditions of a particular period, its heritage and culture, its socio-political milieu. Setting is not just the background, but is part and parcel of what is significant, what creates meaning in your work. 
MOOD is a state of mind or emotion. Our response to place, time, weather, and the things around us is always charged with subtle or profound emotion, mellow or harsh judgment.
SYMBOL is the eternal manifestation of the inner, the concrete expressing the abstract, the contingent standing for the essential. Setting may hinge on the externals, but a writer is always conscious that material things reflect far more than what is seen. 
ACTION is the dynamic relationship between the character and the setting. If setting is the background, then there may be harmony or conflict between the character and the setting. Your characters may be comfortably at ease in the world around them, or they may be uneasy or uncomfortable, full of foreboding.</a>

Using the principle that characters must move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, indicate to which direction does every numbered character move. 4.	Locate the specific passageway (lettered character) for each numbered character by analyzing their relationships. Take note that no two characters can pass through the same pathway.   GUIDE QUESTIONS: 1.	Which are the two directions that the numbered characters are supposed to be transported to?  2.	What is the general structure in the picture that the characters need to pass through to be transferred to the other side? 3.	Identify the specific characters (lettered parts) which are designed to pass through the corresponding specific structures (numbered parts in the boundary). (Example: a to 1, b to 2,etc.)  4.	Which characters do not need a tool or gadget to enter and exit the boundary?  5.	How do you call this kind of transport? 6.	Which characters need a tool or gadget to enter and exit the boundary?  7.	 If you are to make an analogy between the picture and the cell, to which components of the cell will you liken the characters and the boundary?

Inequality between the genders is a phenomenon that goes back at least 4,000 years (Lerner 1986). Although the forms and ways in which it has been practiced differ between cultures and change significantly through history, its persistence has led to the formulation of the concept of patriarchy. Patriarchy refers to a set of institutional structures (like property rights, access to positions of power, relationship to sources of income) that are based on the belief that men and women are dichotomous and unequal categories. Key to patriarchy is what might be called the dominant gender ideology toward sexual differences: the assumption that physiological sex differences between males and females are related to differences in their character, behavior, and ability (i.e., their gender). These differences are used to justify a gendered division of social roles and inequality in access to rewards, positions of power, and privilege. The question that feminists ask therefore is: How does this distinction between male and female, and the attribution of different qualities to each, serve to organize our institutions (e.g., the family, law, the occupational structure, religious institutions, the division between public and private) and to perpetuate inequality between the sexes?

                        <p><strong>answer</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The phrased text is good because it provides a clear and concise definition of patriarchy and explains how it perpetuates gender inequality. It acknowledges that gender inequality has existed for thousands of years and has taken different forms across cultures and history. By highlighting the link between the belief in physiological sex differences and the perpetuation of inequality in access to rewards, positions of power, and privilege, the text provides a framework for understanding the root causes of gender inequality. Furthermore, the question posed at the end of the text reflects a critical feminist perspective on the issue and invites readers to consider how gendered distinctions are embedded in various institutions and practices in society. Overall, the text presents a well-reasoned argument and provides important insights into the persistence of gender inequality.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>The original text discusses the idea of patriarchy, which is a set of institutional structures based on the belief that men and women are inequalities, and the persistence of gender inequality for at least 4,000 years. To justify a gendered division of social roles and inequality in access to rewards, positions of power, and privilege, the dominant gender ideology regarding physiological sex differences is utilized. Feminists pose the question of how this distinction between men and women perpetuates gender inequality.</p><p></p><p>The main points of the original text are accurately conveyed in the paraphrased version. It explains what patriarchy means and how it is based on the idea that there is gender inequality. Gendered social roles and unequal access to rewards, power, and privilege are defended by the assumption that physiological sex differences result in character, behavior, and ability differences. Finally, it raises the issue of how gender inequality in various institutions is perpetuated, which is a concern for feminists.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the paraphrased text is not necessarily beneficial or detrimental; rather, it serves as a neutral summary of the primary ideas in the original text. Without adding any personal biases or opinions, it provides a clear and concise understanding of the subject.</p><br />

                            23. DETERMINE IF GOOD OR BAD THE PHRASED TEXT IN 300 WORDS
Inequality between the genders is a phenomenon that goes back at least 4,000 years (Lerner 1986). Although the forms and ways in which it has been practiced differ between cultures and change significantly through history, its persistence has led to the formulation of the concept of patriarchy. Patriarchy refers to a set of institutional structures (like property rights, access to positions of power, relationship to sources of income) that are based on the belief that men and women are dichotomous and unequal categories. Key to patriarchy is what might be called the dominant gender ideology toward sexual differences: the assumption that physiological sex differences between males and females are related to differences in their character, behavior, and ability (i.e., their gender). These differences are used to justify a gendered division of social roles and inequality in access to rewards, positions of power, and privilege. The question that feminists ask therefore is: How does this distinction between male and female, and the attribution of different qualities to each, serve to organize our institutions (e.g., the family, law, the occupational structure, religious institutions, the division between public and private) and to perpetuate inequality between the sexes?

Patriarchy is defined as institutional structures (like property rights, access to positions of power, relationship to sources of income) that are based on the belief that men and women are unequal. The basic assumption of patriarchy is that physiological sex differences between males and females are related to differences in their character, behavior, and ability.

3. Choose a scene from your childhood. Describe it in the pattern long shot, middle shot, close-up. Start with a wide sweep and end with a tight focus.
Begin another scene with a very small, close image. Widen the lens until you have placed that scene in the context of the entire continent.
KEY TERMS
YOUR VOICE, or your own perspective of the world, can affect the way you create your character’s world. The invitation is to make strange that which is familiar and make familiar that which is exotic. 
DETAIL adds to the meaning of your work. Know your setting fully, experience it mentally, and create it through significant detail. Every detail in your setting supports and impinges on your characters.
CONTEXT includes the societal norms and traditions of a particular period, its heritage and culture, its socio-political milieu. Setting is not just the background, but is part and parcel of what is significant, what creates meaning in your work. 
MOOD is a state of mind or emotion. Our response to place, time, weather, and the things around us is always charged with subtle or profound emotion, mellow or harsh judgment.
SYMBOL is the eternal manifestation of the inner, the concrete expressing the abstract, the contingent standing for the essential. Setting may hinge on the externals, but a writer is always conscious that material things reflect far more than what is seen. 
ACTION is the dynamic relationship between the character and the setting. If setting is the background, then there may be harmony or conflict between the character and the setting. Your characters may be comfortably at ease in the world around them, or they may be uneasy or uncomfortable, full of foreboding.</h2><br />
