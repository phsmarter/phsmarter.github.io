                            1. ESSAY: A happy employee makes a happy customer.</h2><br />
                        We all know that customers are central to the fate of businesses. It’s captured in the maxim, coined by department store tycoons of the early 20th century, “The customer is always right.” Jeff Bezos, one of today’s most iconic businessmen, has laid Amazon’s incredible success at the feet of its obsession with customers, saying “You can be competitor-focused, you can be product-focused, you can be technology-focused, you can be business-model-focused… But in my view, obsessive customer-focus is by far the most protective of Day 1 vitality.”<br />As company leaders strive to put customers first, our latest research offers new insights into how that might be achieved: through engaged and happy employees.<br />Glassdoor knows a lot about employee experience. Studying our database of millions of insights about jobs, salaries, company ratings and reviews, we’ve quantified the impact of worker satisfaction on retention, talent attraction, stock performance, and more.<br />In our new study we asked: Can companies help to achieve high customer satisfaction by investing in employees and ensuring that those who deliver goods and services  are themselves satisfied with their jobs?<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A happy employee makes a happy customer</p><p></p><p>A truly great customer service and customer experience can only be provided by the employees who feel happy and engaged at work. When your employees are happier, so are your customers. And when your customers are happy, they become more loyal to your brand, spend more money with you while your business makes more profits. Employees are considered as one of the most valuable assets for a company. They are the main force behind the company’s success. So happiness of employees is definitely a big factor in driving the company to meet its goals and reap the benefits. Now the question comes that does happy employees create happy customers. Well the answer is definitely yes. The employees act as the public face of the company. It is not the leaders of the company but the employees, who interact with customers &amp; clients on a daily basis. </p><p>Imagine a situation in which you work at customer care centre. The office where you work from is in a bad condition, over crowded &amp; your manger also is very rude.</p><br />

                            4. happiness is more important than success essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Happiness and success are two of the most sought-after aspects of life. While success is often associated with achieving one's goals and aspirations, happiness is more about feeling content and fulfilled. While both are important, some argue that happiness is more important than success.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One of the main reasons that happiness is considered more important than success is that success is often fleeting. People can achieve great success in their careers, but if they are not happy, the success will not bring them true fulfillment. On the other hand, if a person is happy, they are more likely to be content and fulfilled regardless of their level of success.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another reason that happiness is considered more important than success is that success often comes at a cost. People may sacrifice their relationships, health, and personal values in pursuit of success. This can lead to feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction, even if they have achieved their goals.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Additionally, Success is often defined by external factors such as money, status, and power. But happiness is more of an internal state, it depends on how we feel inside and how we perceive our lives. Achieving external success does not necessarily guarantee inner happiness.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, happiness and success are both important aspects of life, but happiness is often considered more important because it is a more enduring state of being. While success can bring temporary satisfaction, true happiness comes from a sense of contentment and fulfillment that is not dependent on external factors.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            5. Why is the Filipino contented and happy according to the essay?​</h2><br />
                        I think Filipinos are always happy because it’s our culture and tradition. As we grow we are taught that life is very simple to be happy.<br /><br />Every little things that we have and receive we truly appreciate it. Eventhough we aren’t rich or we don’t have any abundant food to eat everyday we are still happy.<br /><br />Life is pretty simple in the Philippines so everything you have would make you happy espcially having our family complete at home it’s a great tresure to have all of our family members.<br /><br />I have also noticed that the children in Europe aren’t free as the children in the Philippines. When I was young I have this freedom to go out and play in the morning with my neighbhors or friends we treat each other as sisters or brothers this bonds help us to be more human and feel this essential part of our childhood.<br /><br />We often visit or attend Birthday parties of our neigbhors, they can trust us to look out their house whenever they are not around. We treeat each other as family.<br /><br />One more things is that, we don’t send our elders to “Home for the age” except on different conditions like illness that cannot be treated by the family memebers. For us there are three or four or even five generations of the family living in the same roof.<br /><br />Lastly I guess in our adulthood parents don’t send out their children when they reach the age of 18, they still stay at home this maybe one of the factors that help us to be happy in life.<br /><br />The family that stays together lives a happy and peaceful life.<br />

                        <p></p><p>Happiness is that feeling that comes over you when you know life is good and you can't help but smile. It's the opposite of sadness. Happiness is a sense of well-being, joy, or contentment. When people are successful, or safe, or lucky, they feel happiness.</p><br />

                            8. write an essay about how happy marriage should be​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>         A good marriage is a commitment between a man and a woman, and this commitment includes love, pleasure tolerance and relaxation, but do you know how to have a good marriage? A good start is the honeymoon. Most couples like to spend their honeymoon abroad. They like to go to places where they can find worm beaches, luxury hotels and restaurants and shopping malls. This way is very helpful to make the couple's love grow up very fast, and to give the couple a good chance to know each other, and when they know each other well they will know how to forgive each other. Other people think that gifts are very important to have a good marriage. The husband can present for his lovely wife: jewelry, perfumes, clothes and flowers. This gift from him will make their life full with pleasure and happiness. We also should not forget that the wife should present some expensive gifts to her husband like perfumes and clothes. In my opinion, gifts are very important. Specially when there is a fight between the couple. These small gifts are very helpful to forget what happened. The most effective way is using the nice sweet words. One word and only one word from the husband or from the wife is fare enough to strengthen their love. The husband can say to his wife that she is more beautiful than the flowers or she is everything in his life, and these few words can change their life in a better way forever.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>"Ones Happiness"</strong><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Happiness is something which we can’t describe in words it can only be felt from someone’s expression of a smile. Likewise, happiness is a signal or identification of good and prosperous life. Happiness is very simple to feel and difficult to describe. Moreover, happiness comes from within and no one can steal your happiness.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Every day we see and meet people who look happy from the outside but deep down they are broken and are sad from the inside. For many people, money is the main cause of happiness or grief. But this is not right. Money can buy you food, luxurious house, healthy lifestyle servants, and many more facilities but money can’t buy you happiness</strong><strong> </strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd if money can buy happiness then the rich would be the happiest person on the earth. But, we see a contrary image of the rich as they are sad, fearful, anxious, stressed, and suffering from various problems</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>In addition, they have money still they lack in social life with their family especially their wives and this is the main cause of divorce among them</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Also, due to money, they feel insecurity that everyone is after their money so to safeguard their money and them they hire security. While the condition of the poor is just the opposite. They do not have money but they are happy with and stress-free from these problems.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>In addition, they take care of their wife and children and their divorce rate is also </strong><strong>below</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>As we now know that we can’t buy happiness with money and there is no other shortcut to happiness. It is something that you feel from within.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>In addition, true happiness comes from within yourself. Happiness is basically a state of mind.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Moreover, it can only be achieved by being positive and avoiding any negative thought in mind. And if we look at the bright side of ourselves only then we can be happy.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>People nowadays are not satisfied with their relationship because of their differences and much other reason. But for being happy in a relationship we have to understand that there are some rules or mutual understanding that keeps a relationship healthy and happy.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Firstly, take care of yourself then your partner because if you yourself are not happy then how can you make your partner happy.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Secondly, for a happy and healthy relationship give you partner some time and space. In addition, try to understand their feeling and comfort level because if you don’t understand these things then you won’t be able to properly understand your partner.</strong></p><p><strong>Secondly, for a happy and healthy relationship give you partner some time and space. In addition, try to understand their feeling and comfort level because if you don’t understand these things then you won’t be able to properly understand your partner.Most importantly, take initiative and plan to go out with your partner and family. Besides, if they have plans then go with them.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>To conclude, we can say that happiness can only be achieved by having positive thinking and enjoying life. Also, for being happy and keeping the people around us happy we have to develop a healthy relationship with them. Additionally, we also have to give them the proper time.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I hope you'll like it :) </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Money is often seen as a path to happiness, but is this really the case? While it is true that money can provide individuals with access to certain luxuries and opportunities, it is not a guarantee for happiness. In fact, many individuals who possess great wealth still struggle with mental health issues and feelings of unhappiness. Therefore, the idea that money can buy happiness is a flawed one.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, money can provide individuals with access to material possessions, which can provide temporary satisfaction. However, studies have shown that material possessions do not lead to long-term happiness. The initial excitement and pleasure of purchasing something new wears off quickly, leaving individuals feeling unfulfilled and searching for the next thing to buy. Additionally, the constant pursuit of material possessions can lead to a never-ending cycle of wanting more, which can actually lead to feelings of stress and unhappiness.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, money can provide individuals with experiences that can bring happiness, such as traveling or attending events. However, it is important to note that experiences are only enjoyable if they are shared with loved ones. No matter how much money one has, if they are unable to share experiences with those they care about, they may still feel lonely and unfulfilled.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, studies have shown that individuals cwho prioritize money over relationships and experiences are less happy than those who prioritize social connections and personal growth. This is because social connections and personal growth provide individuals with a sense of purpose and fulfillment that cannot be achieved through material possessions or money.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the idea that money can buy happiness is a flawed one. While money can provide individuals with temporary satisfaction and access to certain experiences, it is not a guarantee for long-term happiness. Instead, individuals should prioritize social connections and personal growth, which can provide them with a sense of purpose and fulfillment that cannot be achieved through money alone.</p><br />

It is based on Gardner's nearly one-year struggle being homeless.[2] The unusual spelling of the film's title comes from a mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside the daycare facility his son attended.</p><br />
