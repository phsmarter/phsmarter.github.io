                        <p></p><p></p><p>Answer</p><p></p><p>The Rizal Law, officially designated as Republic Act No. 1425, is a Philippine law that mandates all educational institutions in the Philippines to offer courses about José Rizal. The main objective is to study the teachings of Dr Jose Rizal. Senator Claro M Recto was the main proponent of the Rizal Bill. The Rizal Law, in any case, was emphatically restricted by the Catholic Church in the Philippines, much appreciated to the anti-clerical subjects that were pertinent in Rizal's books Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. Rizal Law and RH bill has been blocked by the Catholic Church and some lawmakers in Congress, saying that some contraceptives are considered abortifacients by medical professionals. The teaching of the Rizal course in the classroom is intended to awaken the sense of patriotism and nationalism in every Filipino youth and push them to apply the principles bequeathed by Rizal as solutions to present day problems. Sadly, the years have shown that the Rizal law has not been effective.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>The Reproductive Health Law, also known as the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012, is a law in the Philippines that aims to provide universal access to a wide range of family planning methods and information, as well as maternal and child health services. The law also requires that reproductive health education be included in the curriculum of elementary and high school students.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One of the main goals of the Reproductive Health Law is to reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancies and abortions, which can have negative health and social consequences, particularly for women and girls. The law aims to empower individuals, particularly women, to make informed decisions about their reproductive health and to have access to the services and information they need to do so.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Some of the provisions of the Reproductive Health Law that have been controversial include the inclusion of modern family planning methods, such as contraceptives, in the range of services covered by the law. Some people believe that the use of contraceptives is against their religious beliefs or goes against the natural order of things. Others argue that the use of contraceptives is a personal choice and that the government has a responsibility to provide information and access to a range of family planning options.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another controversial provision of the Reproductive Health Law is the requirement for reproductive health education to be included in the curriculum of elementary and high school students. Some people argue that this is inappropriate or unnecessary, while others believe that it is important for young people to have accurate and comprehensive information about reproductive health so that they can make informed decisions about their own bodies and health.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In summary, the Reproductive Health Law aims to provide universal access to a range of family planning methods and information, as well as maternal and child health services, in order to improve the reproductive health and well-being of individuals in the Philippines.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Catholic Church has a long history of opposing abortion, as it believes that life begins at conception and that taking a human life is wrong. The Catholic Church's influence on the issue of abortion and reproductive health law is seen both in its vocal opposition to abortion and its active involvement in politics. In 2012, the Church openly urged Catholics to consider the Church’s position when electing political leaders, and in 2013, the Pope declared abortion “intrinsically evil” during a public mass.</p><p></p><p>In most Catholic countries, abortion is illegal except in cases of a medical emergency or risk to the health of the mother. Catholic Church leaders such as U.S. Knights of Columbus Supreme Knight Carl Anderson have cited Pope Francis’ statement in 2013 to argue against abortion access in the U.S. The Church also plays a key role in the push for laws limiting contraception access and has filed amicus briefs in related court cases.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the influence of the Church on reproductive health law, it is important to note that the Catholic Church has a long history of opposing contraception, sterilization, and in vitro fertilization, and its views on the issue are widely reflected in the laws of many Catholic countries. In a strongly Catholic society such as Mexico, abortion remains illegal except in very specific cases despite the fact that abortion has been decriminalized in other Latin American countries. </p><p></p><p>Sources: </p><p>•	https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727622514/how-does-the-catholic-church-influence-abortion-law </p><p>•	https://www.uscatholic.org/church/role-catholic-church-abortion </p><p>•	https://www.bned.com/resources/Religious-Influence-on-the-Abortion-Debate</p><p>•	https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/06/aborting-abortion-bans-latin-america/563517/</p><br />

</p><p>on politics and social life. The country is at least 80% Catholic and there is a deeply ingrained
</p><p>cultural deference for clergy and religious. Previous attempts in the last 14 years to pass a
</p><p>reproductive health law have failed because of the opposition of Catholic bishops. Thus the
</p><p>recent passage of the ‘Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012’ (R.A.
