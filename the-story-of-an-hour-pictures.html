The Farmer's Donkey
"It's not what happens to you that determines how far you will go in Ite; it is how you
handle who happens to you."
-Zig Ziglar
One day a farmer's donkey fell into an abandoned well. Terrified, the animal

neighbors to help him.

They all grabbed shovels and began to throw dirt into the well. At first, when the donkey
roolized ho was being buried olive, he cried horribly. Then, to everyone's shock, the donkey quieted
down. A few shovel loads later, the former looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw.
With each shovel of dirt that hit the donkey's back, the donkey would shake it off and take a step up.
As the farmer and his neighbors continued to throw dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and
take another step up. Soon everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the
well and happily trotted off!
Life is going to throw dirt your way and attempt to bury you. However, no one ever gets out of life's
wells by giving up! Shake the dirt off and take a step up!

                                            Read the text and answer the questions that follow.Which one is better, a book or a movie? Some argue that one is better than the other, but it is still subject to debate. Both are good sources of entertainment and information, but because movies are shortened versions of books, some important details might not be included. Watching a movie will only take about two to three hours, while it will probably take you days before you can finish a whole book. Books can still be appealing to read even after 20 years. On the one hand, movies lose their appeal over time because of technological changes and advancements. However, movies are more visually appealing than books, but if it's the story you are after, both are on the same level. When you read books, you become more of a part of them; whereas you tend to be more passive when you watch movies. Compared with movies, books engage your imagination by letting you picture the characters’ faces, characters’ voices, and places. In conclusion, although books and movies share some similarities, it is apparent that readers have more to offer.Guide Questions:1. How did the writer introduce the main idea?2.

With each shovel of dirt that hit the donkey's back, the donkey would shake it off and take a step up.
As the farmer and his neighbors continued to throw dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and
take another step up. Soon everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the

                            7. Read the text and answer the questions that follow.Which one is better, a book or a movie? Some argue that one is better than the other, but it is still subject to debate. Both are good sources of entertainment and information, but because movies are shortened versions of books, some important details might not be included. Watching a movie will only take about two to three hours, while it will probably take you days before you can finish a whole book. Books can still be appealing to read even after 20 years. On the one hand, movies lose their appeal over time because of technological changes and advancements. However, movies are more visually appealing than books, but if it's the story you are after, both are on the same level. When you read books, you become more of a part of them; whereas you tend to be more passive when you watch movies. Compared with movies, books engage your imagination by letting you picture the characters’ faces, characters’ voices, and places. In conclusion, although books and movies share some similarities, it is apparent that readers have more to offer.Guide Questions:1. How did the writer introduce the main idea?2.

In the beginning, they used anhourglass. This is a cylindrical glass with a narrow center which allows sand to flow fromits upper to its lower portion. Once all the sand has tricked to the lower portion oneknows that an hour has passed. Using the same idea, water clocks were constructed tomeasure time by having water flow through a narrow passage from one container toanother. On the other hand, sundials allowed people to estimate an hour by looking at theposition of the shadow cast by the sun on a plate at night, people measured time bychecking the alignment of the stars in the sky.
