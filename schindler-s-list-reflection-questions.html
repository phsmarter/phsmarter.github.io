                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The title of the movie is Immortal Beloved.</p><p>2. The main characters in the movie are Ludwig van Beethoven, played by Gary Oldman, and his Immortal Beloved, Antonie Brentano, played by Isabella Rossellini. Ludwig is a famous musician and composer in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and is struggling with his increasing deafness. Antonie is the mysterious woman he loves, and the movie follows their tumultuous relationship. The supporting characters are Ludwig’s friends, Karl Beethoven and Johann van Beethoven, and his publishers, Anton Schindler and Franz Oliva.</p><p></p><p>3. Schindler visits Vienna, Prague, Berlin, Leipzig, and Dresden to find the Immortal Beloved. In Vienna, Schindler visits Antonie Brentano’s home, as well as the residences of other women who may have been the Immortal Beloved. In Prague, he visits the home of Josephine Brunsvik. In Berlin, he visits the home of Amalie Sebald. In Leipzig, he visits the home of Julie Guicciardi. And in Dresden, he visits the home of Therese Malfatti. </p><p></p><p>4. Karl Beethoven is Ludwig van Beethoven’s older brother. He is the executor of Beethoven’s estate and is responsible for delivering the Immortal Beloved letter to Schindler after Beethoven’s death. Karl was also a great influence in Beethoven’s life, providing financial support, and motivating Beethoven to continue writing music. He is the one who pushed Beethoven to become the great composer he is today. </p><p></p><p>5. The compositions by Ludwig Van Beethoven included in the movie are The Moonlight Sonata, The Appassionata, Emperor Concerto, and The Ninth Symphony. The inspirations for these pieces were personal experiences such as his unrequited love for Antonie Brentano and his struggles with deafness. His motivations were to express his emotions and to prove to the world that he can still create great music despite his deafness. </p><p></p><p>6. The probable reasons of Beethoven's deafness are hereditary, exposure to loud noises, illnesses, and a medical condition known as otosclerosis. </p><p></p><p>7. The Immortal Beloved is Antonie Brentano, a married woman whom Beethoven had an unrequited love for. She is called such because Beethoven never revealed her identity in the letter he wrote to her, and her identity remained a mystery until Schindler identified her through his investigation. </p><p></p><p>8. My favorite part of the movie is the scene in which Beethoven is conducting his Ninth Symphony in Vienna. I love this scene because it is the climax of the movie as Beethoven has overcome his struggles with deafness and is able to showcase his brilliance as a composer. It is also a moment of triumph for him as he is able to prove that he can still create beautiful music despite his disability. </p><p></p><p>9. My least favorite part of the movie is the scene when Beethoven is dying. I do not like this scene because it is a sad moment when Beethoven passes away, and it is heartbreaking to watch. </p><p></p><p>10. My learnings/realizations after watching Immortal Beloved are: </p><p>• Love can be powerful, and it can drive people to do extraordinary things. </p><p>• Music can transcend language and communicate emotions. </p><p>• It is possible to work through disability and adversity. </p><p>• It is important to appreciate the people in our lives. </p><p>• Even though we may never know who the Immortal Beloved is, her story is a reminder of the power of love.</p><br />

                        <p>1.	The title of the movie is Immortal Beloved.</p><p>2.	The main characters in the movie are Ludwig van Beethoven and his Immortal Beloved. The supporting characters include Anton Schindler, Beethoven's secretary; Karl van Beethoven, Beethoven's nephew; and Johann van Beethoven, Beethoven's father.</p><p>3.	Schindler visited several places in search of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved, including Prague, Leipzig, and Vienna. In Prague, he met with Beethoven's former pupil, Antonie Brentano, who claimed to be the Immortal Beloved. In Leipzig, he met with Beethoven's former lover, Antonie Brentano, who also claimed to be the Immortal Beloved. In Vienna, he met with Beethoven's brother, Johann van Beethoven, who provided him with letters that may have revealed the identity of the Immortal Beloved.</p><p>4.	Karl van Beethoven was Ludwig van Beethoven's nephew and only male heir. He was an important figure in Beethoven's life because he was responsible for managing his uncle's affairs and finances, as well as ensuring that his compositions were published and performed.</p><p>5.	Some of Beethoven's compositions featured in the movie include the Moonlight Sonata, the Fifth Symphony, and the Ninth Symphony. The inspirations for these compositions came from Beethoven's personal experiences and emotions, such as his love for the Immortal Beloved and his struggle with deafness.</p><p>6.	The probable reasons for Beethoven's deafness include genetics, physical trauma, and chronic illnesses.</p><p>7.	The Immortal Beloved is the object of Beethoven's deepest and most passionate love. She is called such because her identity remains unknown and she is immortalized through Beethoven's music and letters.</p><p>8.	My favorite part of the movie is the scene where Beethoven is composing the Ninth Symphony and he is overcome with emotion as he realizes the beauty of the music. I like this scene because it shows the depth of Beethoven's passion and creativity, and the impact of his music on those who hear it.</p><p>9.	My least favorite part of the movie is the scene where Schindler confronts Johann van Beethoven and accuses him of hiding the identity of the Immortal Beloved. I think this scene is unnecessarily confrontational and does not add anything to the story.</p><p>10.	Some of the things I learned/realized after watching Immortal Beloved are: the power of music to convey emotion and inspire change; the impact of Beethoven's personal struggles on his music; the importance of family and close relationships in supporting artistic expression; and the enduring mystery and allure of the Immortal Beloved.</p><br />
