                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Firstly, allowing children to choose their own career helps them to discover their true passions and talents. Children are naturally curious and have a sense of what interests them. By allowing them to explore their interests, they can find what they are passionate about and what they are good at. This can lead to greater job satisfaction, as they are doing something they enjoy.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, when children are allowed to choose their own career, they are more likely to take ownership of their decisions. This sense of ownership and responsibility can lead to greater motivation and effort in pursuing their chosen career path. They are also more likely to stick with their chosen career path, rather than being forced into a career that they have no interest in.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, allowing children to choose their own career can foster independence and confidence. When children make their own decisions, they learn to trust themselves and their abilities. This can lead to greater self-esteem and confidence in their own abilities to make decisions and handle challenges.</p><br />

                            8. what health career will i choose based on my skills and interest essay</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Career planning is always important. It is through career planning that I will be guided on my plans in pursuing the chosen field. With such, it is necessary to base my health career on my skills and interest.</p><p>As I set my foot to achieve my dreams, I should know that together with my aspirations is my inclinations on the chosen field. Why must my skills and interest be in accordance with my future health career? Simply because I cannot fully function in my chosen career if my abilities, values and personality do not align with it. Choosing a career that is way far from who I am and what I am capable of doing is like departing to the ocean without proper destination. If my skills are not in line with my career, then I will be not functional in that field in any way.

A worldview is a way in which we see the world and the people around us. A worldview is like looking through glasses because a person’s worldview clarifies the way, in which they view people and the world around them. A person’s worldview is the foundational element that guides their decision-making. Worldviews are a set of presuppositions that are different from person to person, but are crucial to understand because they provide the basis for our decision-making. As a Christian there are certain elements that should be contained in a Christian worldview. (105)</p><p></p><p>A Christian worldview starts with the belief that God exists.

That does not mean that I am looking for a pastor to be president, but rather that I look at what presidential candidate’s beliefs are and check their beliefs against the Bible. Voting for a candidate that aligns pretty close with what Christians believe is best because that means the candidate will do their best to run the country to honor God. Another key area that my worldview should influence is my future career because whatever I decide to do, I should have the mindset to honor and serve God with my career. As of right now, my future plans are to become a counselor and that aligns with my beliefs because I know that there are many people that are hurting in this world. Those hurting people need encouragement, but they also need to know that God is always there for them.

                            28. Essay about Career talk​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Each and every one of us has faced a certain junction or a cross-road at some point in our lives that has had a major impact on our lives. This can be both a professional crossroads or personal crossroads. But in this essay on career, I would like to talk about the cross-road that we see in our professional career. It’s not just the students who would have faced a dilemma in deciding a career, even employees past 30 years of age face this crisis.</p><p>When a student’s face its called a beginner’s crisis, but when an employee 6 years down the lane faces dilemmas in his or her career choices, then its usually called a mid-life crisis or mid-career crisis. Midlife crisis is a term that refers to people who are having second thoughts about their career a few years down after working in the same. There might be plenty of reasons for these some of which may be an everyday monologue, fatigue, salary issues, professional growth issues, internal office dilemmas, etc. In this essay on career, I am going to talk about both the type of career choices.</p><p></p><p>A student’s life is the first crossroad that we face in our lives. By keeping certain factors in mind, there is plenty of career choice a student can choose from. Some of the popular career choices are engineering, medicine, arts, and commerce. Which career to choose and on what terms is something that every student will have to worry about. There are certain criteria to choose a career, which are:</p><p></p>Passion: The word passion sounds cliche, but it is an important criterion to consider before choosing a career path. If everyone follows their passion and chose a career accordingly, then the concept of a mid-career crisis wouldn’t have occurred in the first place. Every one of us would have dreamt of something during our childhood. We all wanted to become a police, a cricketer, an actor, a doctor or an engineer. But not everyone follows and listens to the child in them. We ultimately give up on our passions and choose a safe career which will give us a good salary. Risk-taking is a part and parcel of life and no one should regret not doing something 80 years down the lane when they are on their death bed.Stability: Financial stability, as well as job stability, is something that should be considered as an important criterion. Because the world is increasingly changing and many industries are being taken out by emerging technologies. So before choosing a particular career path, the stability as the well the salary factors should be taken into accountFuture prospects: Future prospects, both in terms of your interest in the field as well the survival of the field itself, in the next 20 years should be taken into consideration. A Mid-career crisis can be avoided if future prospects are evaluated properly. Certain industries might fall and certain might become the next biggest phenomenon. People who are serious about their careers choose a path which has a long-lasting prospectSatisfaction: This is another important factor while choosing a career path. A good salary, a nice work environment and a good location might give some people the job satisfaction they need, but there are some people who are not affected by any of that. The only thing that matters to them is the job itself. Usually, a job that is socially helpful is the ones that provide true satisfaction.<p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Career is a very important thing in one’s life. Whatever career path you choose to follow, it will impact your life greatly. Your career will define your status in a society in addition to your lifestyle. In other words, your career will determine your social circle and relationships.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it is extremely important to choose the correct career path. From a very young age, we aspire to be something or the other. While someone aims to be a doctor, some wish to become a painter. Our career choices depend on a lot of things. Thus, it is important to consider all factors before choosing a career path.</p><p></p><p>You must consider a number of factors before deciding on your career. Each factor plays a significant role in your choice. Firstly, always assess yourself thoroughly. You must understand your area of interest to choose a career. For instance, someone who dances well can surely become a doctor, but his interest will always be in dance. Thus, ensure that you have the caliber to perform well in the field you choose. This will come from your area of interest itself.</p><p></p><p>After that, you look for the opportunities available as per your area of interest. Now that you are aware of what you like and dislike, you can easily look for occupations matching your passion. Make a list of the occupations you can get into following your interests.
