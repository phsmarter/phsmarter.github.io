                                            Activity 3. A. Read the passage carefully then fill in the blanks below with the needed information taken from the given paragraph: Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees are not just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth's environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, more than half of the world's rain forests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute. Scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world's climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper.You use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. A final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. Most schools, offices, and districts have some kind of recycling center. If you follow the three Rs - reduce, reuse, and recycle,you can help save the world's forests. varagraph.

                                            Activity 4 Write an opinion essay on this topic "climate change " Use opinion expressions to emphasize your point. In writing your essay, you may use the following structure. Paragraph 1 - Write an introduction to your essay. State your main idea or the point you are trying to prove and give two reasons for your stand. Example: In my opinion, Covid-19 forced us to take a break from our normal activities and continue living in the comfort of our own homes. Because of this pandemic, many kinds of hero stepped forward to save lives and protect the vulnerable. On the other hand, a lot of workers lost their jobs while some decided to commit crimes to answer the call of a rumbling stomach. Paragraph 2 and 3 Write the body of your essay. Explain in detail the reasons you have stated in your first paragraph. Develop a paragraph for each reason you have cited. Example: Front liners took their oath seriously to save lives no matter what is at stake. They left behind their worrying families to combat an invisible enemy. Good Samaritans readily offered their resources to feed both the front liners and the hungry. Good Samaritans offered a portion of their wealth to help put a stop to this viral outbreak. The more people were encouraged to apply social distancing, the more they got closer to their loved ones. On the contrary, we have witnessed how some took advantage of the situation to satisfy their personal interests. We have seen how oppression happened just because the victims were helpless. We had a glimpse of the wolves hiding behind sheep's clothing. ragraph 4-Write your conclusion. Sum up your position by restating your in idea and finishing with a "call to action."​</a>

                                            deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. they clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. they also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. in the past fifty years, more than half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. one solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. if you use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. how can you use less paper? one answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. a second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. the backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. a final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. most schools, offices, and districts have recycling center. if you follow the three rs – reduce, reuse, and recycle –, you can help save the world’s forests

Write them on the second column.Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty tolook at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food,fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, morethan half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! Scientists say that if deforestationcontinues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, andanimals will die.One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. If you use lesspaper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answeris to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists orPhone messages and when you write a rought draft of an essay write on back of.AnswerQuestion1.

caused by humans?”</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The topic I chose to write about is Global Warming. Global Warming has been studied and analyzed for many years. Many people are poorly educated on this matter and do not truly understand what is actually going on. Not everyone believes that global warming truly exist. A lot of people believed that global warming was completely man-made. And, even though this is not completely incorrect, there is an abundance of evidence to prove that global warming is problem that persists, right now as we speak. Global warming has continued to impacted us in many ways. From the tornadoes of 2011 to hurricane Sandy in 2012, the effects of global warming are all around us and we as humans have to propose a plan to sop it.The first picture is from the famous …show more content…
</p><p>According to Lenntech, Svante Arrhenius and Thomas Chamberlin realized that humans could increase the heat of the earth by adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere(Enzler). Also according to the article, after Svante Arrhenius died in 1927, his theory was forgotten for a long time because it was thought that human activities on the Earth were too minimal to actually have any effect on the Earth. However, the statement has been proven that global warming has become a major issue due to the constant pollution produced from man made machines. Global warming starts when many air pollutants and carbon monoxide are trapped in the Earth’s atmosphere causing the planet to become very hot. According to Nasa this picture depicts the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere over time. As you can see it wasn’t until recently that the level of CO2 emission has skyrocketed to a never before seen level.</p><p>The idea that humans could change the planet's climate may be counter-intuitive, but the basic science is well understood. Each year, human activity causes billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases to be released into the atmosphere. As scientists have known for decades, these gases capture heat that would otherwise escape to space – the equivalent of wrapping the planet in an invisible blanket.
</p><p>
</p><p>Of course, the planet's climate has always been in flux thanks to "natural" factors such as changes in solar or volcanic activity, or cycles relating the Earth's orbit around the sun. According to the scientific literature, however, the warming recorded to date matches the pattern of warming we would expect from a build up of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere – not the warming we would expect from other possible causes.
</p><p>
</p><p>Even if scientists did discover another plausible explanation for the warming observed to date, that would beg a difficult question. As Robert Henson puts it in The Rough Guide to Climate Change:</p><p>"If some newly discovered factor can account for the climate change then why aren't carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases producing the warming that basic physics tells us they should be?"</p><p>The only way to prove with 100% certainty that humans are responsible for global warming would be to run an experiment with two identical Earths – one with human influence and one without. That obviously isn't possible, and so most scientists are careful not to state human influence as an absolute certainty. Nonetheless, the evidence is now extremely strong.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>brainliest thank you :)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are many changes we can bring about in our life both big and small to prevent global warming and save our planet. We must stop deforestation in all forms. Do not cut down more trees as it will only worsen the level of carbon dioxide in the air. Instead, encourage people to plant even more trees to create a fine balance in nature. Most importantly,  we must replace all our ordinary bulbs with LED lights. It will help in reducing the use of energy by a massive amount. Similarly, do not waste that energy. Instead of becoming more dependent, we need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and electricity right away. It is time to act accordingly and do every bit on our part to stop this catastrophe.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The earth is considered one of the most beautiful planets in the universe. It is the only planet in the galaxy that has enough water to support life. Unfortunately, the planet is suffering due to many environmental problems that may affect people, societies, and ecosystems. These problems can result in major consequences for everyone's daily life. The major environmental problems that are facing the world today are deforestation, global warming, and water pollution. The decimation of Earth's forest is one of the most serious global environmental problems (Paul and Anne 162). Deforestation can affect biodiversity, the atmosphere, and land. The loss of forest means the loss of many habitats for many species. The current statistics shows that as many as 100 species become extinct every day with a large portion being attributed to deforestation (Innes). This unnatural extinction of species endangers the world's food supply, threatens many human resources and has profound implications for biological diversity (Steger and Bowermaster 100). The lack of biodiversity and a reduced planetary gene pool could have many unforeseen ramifications, some of which could be fatal to the future (Innes). Many valuable chemical compounds are created in the jungles. Alkaloids, a small plant from Madagascar is proven effective in treating Hodgkin's disease and childhood leukemia. Curare, made from plant that grows only in the Amazon, is used in heart operations as a muscle relaxant. More than 225 rain forest plants from Costa Rica alone are thought to be potential anti-cancer agents</p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Pa brainliest  naman po  TY</strong></p><br />

                            18. Activity 4 Write an opinion essay on this topic "climate change " Use opinion expressions to emphasize your point. In writing your essay, you may use the following structure. Paragraph 1 - Write an introduction to your essay. State your main idea or the point you are trying to prove and give two reasons for your stand. Example: In my opinion, Covid-19 forced us to take a break from our normal activities and continue living in the comfort of our own homes. Because of this pandemic, many kinds of hero stepped forward to save lives and protect the vulnerable. On the other hand, a lot of workers lost their jobs while some decided to commit crimes to answer the call of a rumbling stomach. Paragraph 2 and 3 Write the body of your essay. Explain in detail the reasons you have stated in your first paragraph. Develop a paragraph for each reason you have cited. Example: Front liners took their oath seriously to save lives no matter what is at stake. They left behind their worrying families to combat an invisible enemy. Good Samaritans readily offered their resources to feed both the front liners and the hungry. Good Samaritans offered a portion of their wealth to help put a stop to this viral outbreak. The more people were encouraged to apply social distancing, the more they got closer to their loved ones. On the contrary, we have witnessed how some took advantage of the situation to satisfy their personal interests. We have seen how oppression happened just because the victims were helpless. We had a glimpse of the wolves hiding behind sheep's clothing. ragraph 4-Write your conclusion. Sum up your position by restating your in idea and finishing with a "call to action."​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Climate change is an important, current and ongoing issue.  If you are unaware of what climate change is, it is a global or regional change in weather patterns that lasts for a long period of time. Climate change is greatly caused by the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide which is produced by the use of fossil fuels, such as exhaust from cars and trucks, burning trash, and factory emissions. These are also contributing to global warming which is, a gradual increase in the overall temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. Some effects of global warming in the are rising temperatures in the air and in the water surrounding  Another is the loss of sea ice and melting of ice sheets which is caused by the increased temperatures. This also greatly impacts the  plants and animals, they are rapidly dying, decreasing in numbers, possibly leading to their extinction.</p><br />

                            19. deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. they clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. they also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. in the past fifty years, more than half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. one solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. if you use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. how can you use less paper? one answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. a second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. the backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. a final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. most schools, offices, and districts have recycling center. if you follow the three rs – reduce, reuse, and recycle –, you can help save the world’s forests

                            27. ParagraphDirections: Read and understand the paragraphs below, then answer the questions thatfollow. Write them on the second column.Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty tolook at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food,fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, morethan half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! Scientists say that if deforestationcontinues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, andanimals will die.One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. If you use lesspaper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answeris to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists orPhone messages and when you write a rought draft of an essay write on back of.AnswerQuestion1.
