Making and Keeping Friends 
Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other's happiness and supporting each other when times are tough.
A lot of friends have things in common so it's easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can Per even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. 
Showing you care about the other person's happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends' faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. 
Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don't know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it's uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it's nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that's when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. 
Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>There are several individuals who have had a significant influence on my attitude, values, and behaviors as an adolescent. One of them is my parents, who have always been supportive and encouraging, and have taught me the value of hard work and responsibility. They have also instilled in me the importance of honesty, integrity, and respect for others. Another significant individual is my teacher, who has not only taught me academic subjects, but has also guided me in developing important life skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving. She has also encouraged me to be open-minded and to value diversity and inclusion.It is important for adolescents to learn about Filipino social values because these values shape the culture and society in which they live. They provide a foundation for how we interact with others and make decisions in our daily lives. Learning about these values helps adolescents understand the expectations and norms of their community, and it helps them develop a sense of belonging and connection to their culture. It can also help adolescents develop a sense of responsibility towards their community and towards others, which is important for their personal and social development.Other people's evaluation of ourselves is important because it helps us understand how we are perceived by others and how we fit into our social environment. It can also serve as a source of feedback and help us identify areas for improvement. However, it is important to remember that other people's evaluations are just one perspective and should not be the sole determinant of our self-worth. It is also important to balance other people's evaluations with our own self-evaluation, as this can help us develop a more well-rounded and accurate understanding of ourselves.One example of a Filipino social value that can be observed up to the present is the value of pakikipagkapwa-tao, which refers to the importance of being considerate and empathetic towards others. This value is evident in the way Filipinos often prioritize the needs and feelings of others, and in the way they often value relationships and social connections. This value can be seen in the way Filipinos often extend hospitality and generosity to others, and in the way they often value harmony and peaceful resolution of conflicts.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Making and Keeping Friends 
Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other's happiness and supporting each other when times are tough.
A lot of friends have things in common so it's easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can Per even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. 
Showing you care about the other person's happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends' faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. 
Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don't know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it's uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it's nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that's when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. 
Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care
