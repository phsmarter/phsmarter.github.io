                        <p>Effectively communicating ensures that you not only convey your message to someone but also let them know about your feelings and emotions. Whether it is amongst family members, friends, or office colleagues, effective communication helps individuals get through the tasks of life with ease. Effective communication provides a foundation for trust and respect to grow. It also helps better understand a person and the context of the conversation. Individuals often believe that their communication skills are much better than what they actually are.</p><p>Answer:</p><p>Include some topics about friendship, shy people, and how to be a good listener. </p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Essays like this is expected to have good grammar, since it's about communication.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> Stress is the state of tension experienced by individuals facing too many demands, constraints or opportunities. Work is sometime stressful and can easily disrupt a person's work-life balance. Work related stress comes from numerous factors such as too many task demands, role conflicts, job boredom, ethical dilemmas, or interpersonal problems. Poor career development and physical environment are also cause of workplace stress. But technology is now one of the biggest factors of stress. The information technology growth and globalization may enhance workplace productivity, but it also increases stress on workers. Technology is supposed to make employees feel more productive at work, less burdened. But technology is moving too fast for some people contributing to more stress. Technology increases stress because of the demand of learning new skills, possibility of lost information due to computer crashes or demands of email and voicemail. Adjusting to new technologies like the web, networks, and personal communications have saturated today's workplace and placed more burdens and demands on workers- this definitely causes increased stress. There are now too many expectations, too many changes in work practice. Because of all the opportunity and technology available, instead of assigning a project over a few days, a manager will want a task completed by lunchtime. Stress and overload will emerge from these types of task demands. Too many expectations and demands cause burnout. With technology innovation comes fear of being next on the list to be laid off. Inadequate training and career development in technology is the cause job insecurity. With the pressures of mastering the IT revolution, there are increased productivity demands. Employees will need extra training to enhance employability and this causes stress also. Struggling to understand technologies is yet another cause of tension.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hoping i can get ur brainliest :)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a representative of the youth, I want to address an issue that may not be the most prominent in our society but affects many of us: mental health. Mental health is a subject that has been taboo for a long time, and many people still feel ashamed of talking about it or seeking help.</p><p></p><p>As a young person, I have witnessed how mental health problems have affected myself and my peers. The pressures of social media, academic success, and fitting in with our peers have led to feelings of anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts.</p><p></p><p>We need to address this issue, not only on a personal and family level, but also on a local and national level. We need to raise awareness of mental health and create a safe environment where people can talk about their struggles without fear of stigma or shame.</p><p></p><p>Our schools and communities can play an essential role in this process. We need to educate young people about mental health and the resources available to them. We need to provide access to mental health services, such as counseling and therapy, in schools and community centers.</p><p></p><p>Mental health should also be a priority in our government policies. We need to work towards creating a healthcare system that is more accessible, affordable, and provides quality mental health care for everyone.</p><p></p><p>No one should have to suffer in silence or feel ashamed of seeking help for their mental health problems. We need to work together to create a society that values and prioritizes mental health just as much as physical health.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, mental health is an urgent issue that needs more attention, awareness, and action. As a young person, I believe that we can make a difference by speaking out, supporting each other, and advocating for change. Let us break the stigma surrounding mental health and work towards a society that values and supports the mental well-being of all its members.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Power of Small Actions</p><p></p><p>As a representative of the youth today, I want to talk about the power of small actions. It's easy to feel overwhelmed by the biggest issues in our world, but sometimes the biggest impact can come from the smallest actions.</p><p></p><p>For example, reducing our use of single-use plastics. It may seem like a small action, but by bringing a reusable water bottle or saying no to a plastic straw, we can collectively make a big impact on the environment. Or volunteering at a local charity or food bank. It may seem small, but it can make a world of difference to those in need and inspire others to do the same.</p><p></p><p>Small actions can also make a big difference in our personal lives. Taking a few minutes each day to practice gratitude or mindfulness can improve our mental health and well-being. Or making the effort to connect with a friend or family member, even if it's just a quick text or phone call, can strengthen relationships and make us feel more connected.</p><p></p><p>We don't need to wait for others to start making a change. We can be the change we want to see in the world, even if it's just in small ways. We can set an example for others and inspire them to join us. We can make a difference.</p><p></p><p>In a world where it's easy to feel powerless, let's remember the power of small actions. They may seem insignificant, but they can start a ripple effect that can change the world.</p><br />
