                                            SELECTION 2 C For Conversation, Press # 1 by Michael Alvear A funny thing happened in the way to communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and-poof! ---I became invisible, absent from the conversation because of a gadget designed to make communication easier. The park was filled with people talking on their cell phones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopping to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact. The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the Internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. In making deposit at the bank, you can just insert your card into the ATM. With voice mail, you can conduct entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine. As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets auto- mated, the alienation index goes up. I am no Luddite. I own a cell phone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, and an e-mail account. Giving them up isn't an option---they're great for what they're intended to do. It's their unintended consequences that make me cringe. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cell-phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I'm home.

Researchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy to show that coronaviruses enter human cells through an interaction with angiotensin- AE converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Scientists exploring how coronaviruses like COVID-19 infect human cells have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spilce (S) glycoprotein binds to the cell do membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells. COVID-19 has been shown to bind to ACE2 via the S protein on its surface. During infection, the S protein is cleaved into subunits. Si and S2. Si contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) which allows coronaviruses to directly bind to the peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2. S2 then liicely plays a role in membrane fusion.

                                            A carbon atom being placed in the Group 4A in the periodic table has 4 valence electrons. With this, it has the capacity to form a maximum of 4 bonds with other elements. Since these valence electrons are shared with other atoms the bonding is known as covalent bond. It can form single, double and triple bonds to achieve a filled octet and be stable. With these abilities of the carbon atoms, chemical bonds between carbon atoms and other elements can form different kinds of compounds with short and long straight and branched chained structures. Organic compounds are group of compounds that contain the element carbon. Many organic compounds are formed because of the special characteristics of this element. These compounds contain carbon and hydrogen combined with other elements, namely, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulphur, and halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). Ethyl alcohol, acetone, gasoline, naphthalene, acetic acid, vanillin, acetylene, and esters are just few examples of many useful organic compounds. These compounds are produced by plants and animals. However, these carbon-containing compounds can also be produced artificially. There are also organic compounds that are produced from petroleum: liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), gasoline, lubricating oil and kerosene. Many organic compounds are commonly used at home or in the community. These compounds have their specific uses. Some of these compounds are used to fuel vehicles, light lamps, cook food, disinfect wounds, flavor beverages, and lubricate machines. Ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol), acetic acid, acetone, and diesel oil are just some of the many examples of useful organic compounds. Other examples of organic compounds are shown in the table below.​</a>

                            7. SELECTION 2 C For Conversation, Press # 1 by Michael Alvear A funny thing happened in the way to communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and-poof! ---I became invisible, absent from the conversation because of a gadget designed to make communication easier. The park was filled with people talking on their cell phones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopping to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact. The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the Internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. In making deposit at the bank, you can just insert your card into the ATM. With voice mail, you can conduct entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine. As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets auto- mated, the alienation index goes up. I am no Luddite. I own a cell phone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, and an e-mail account. Giving them up isn't an option---they're great for what they're intended to do. It's their unintended consequences that make me cringe. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cell-phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I'm home. Readers Digest, pp. 143-145, July 2000 Questions: 1. What is your understanding on this passage: "Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel?" 2. Why do you think the author came up with this kind of article? 3. Upon reading the article, do you agree with the author's opinion? Why or why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Due to less connectivity with the people and belongingness there is a loneliness and depression creates in a human technology is one of the main cause these days that creates disconnected from everyone and there will remain no social life.</p><p></p><p>2. I believe that the author came up with this kind of article is to remind us that because of our addiction to gadgets nowadays, we don't enjoy life as much as possible. Remember, we only live once so we need to savor and enjoy every single moment-memorable or horrible.</p><p></p><p>3. I strongly agree with the author's opinion. As a person who also became addicted to my phone and social media that sometimes I forget to do important tasks like studying. I also don't get to enjoy life. I remember that whenever we would travel, I would always be on my phone or I would be looking for wifi. But I think the beauty of traveling allows me to leave my gadgets and appreciate the world. Our gadgets may be useful right now with online classes and research.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Credits:FTO</p><br />

Researchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy to show thatcoronaviruses enter human cells through an interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).Scientists exploring how coronaviruses like COVID-19 infect human cellshave shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the cellmembrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter human cells.COVID-19 has been shown to bind to ACE2 via the S protein on its surface. Duringinfection, the S protein is cleaved into subunits, Sl and S2. Si contains thereceptor binding domain (RBD) which allows coronaviruses to directly bind to thepeptidase domain (PD) of ACE2. S2 then likely plays a role in membrane fusion.What is the purpose of the text?a. explain how Covid-19 enters human cell.b. classify the different corona virus.c. entertain the readers about the effect of covid-19.2.

                            24. A carbon atom being placed in the Group 4A in the periodic table has 4 valence electrons. With this, it has the capacity to form a maximum of 4 bonds with other elements. Since these valence electrons are shared with other atoms the bonding is known as covalent bond. It can form single, double and triple bonds to achieve a filled octet and be stable. With these abilities of the carbon atoms, chemical bonds between carbon atoms and other elements can form different kinds of compounds with short and long straight and branched chained structures. Organic compounds are group of compounds that contain the element carbon. Many organic compounds are formed because of the special characteristics of this element. These compounds contain carbon and hydrogen combined with other elements, namely, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulphur, and halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). Ethyl alcohol, acetone, gasoline, naphthalene, acetic acid, vanillin, acetylene, and esters are just few examples of many useful organic compounds. These compounds are produced by plants and animals. However, these carbon-containing compounds can also be produced artificially. There are also organic compounds that are produced from petroleum: liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), gasoline, lubricating oil and kerosene. Many organic compounds are commonly used at home or in the community. These compounds have their specific uses. Some of these compounds are used to fuel vehicles, light lamps, cook food, disinfect wounds, flavor beverages, and lubricate machines. Ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol), acetic acid, acetone, and diesel oil are just some of the many examples of useful organic compounds. Other examples of organic compounds are shown in the table below.​</h2><br />
