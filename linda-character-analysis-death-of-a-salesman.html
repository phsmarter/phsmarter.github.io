Willy is a 63 year old travelling salesman who came from Brooklyn. He has 34 years of experience with the company who cuts his pay and fires him. His insecurity and difficulty to bear with the pressing realities of his life led him to create an imaginative, fantasy world for him to be able to cope up with his current status.</p><p>•	<strong>Linda Loman</strong></p><p>She is the wife of the protagonist. Linda is a devoted and loving wife. She understands her husband’s needs shortcomings and dreams.  She passed through Willy’s dreams of grandiosity and delusions.  Linda seems quiet and passive but she seems to get the reality that was going on.  Though she takes in Willy’s hopes for future glory, she is far more into reality than her beloved husband. She was the emotional strength of the family.  </p><p>•	<strong>Biff Loman</strong></p><p>He is Willy and Linda’s elder son. He is 34 years old. When he was in high school, he was a football star living a charmed life. He had many female admirers, good male peers and university scholarship prospects. However, this changed one day when he saw his father with another woman in a hotel room. He then failed math during his final year in high school and ultimately, he dropped out. He likes working with his hands, more specifically, he is a kleptomaniac.  He also works his hands in something that he likes which is farming.</p><p>•	<strong>Harold “Happy” Loman</strong></p><p>He is Willy and Linda’s younger son. He is 32 years old. He has lived in the shadow of Biff all his life.

He is a successful business owner and he has one son. He pities Willy thus he gives him money for him to be able to pay his bills. He frequently comes over to Willy’s house to play with him. He offered Willy a job which he always declines.</p><p>•	<strong>Bernard</strong></p><p>He is the son of Charley. He was a nerd during the past and gives Biff the answers to tests as he was forced by Willy. He worships and regards Biff as a hero and would do anything for him. Later on, he became a well-established, successful lawyer. He is also married and expecting his second son. His successes are what Willy wants for his sons, particularly for Biff.</p><p>•	<strong>Ben</strong></p><p>Willy’s wealthy, older brother who recently died. He became a diamond tycoon after an African detour. He is Willy’s role model. Thus, even after he died, Willy speaks to him frequently in his daydreams or hallucinations of the past. He is regarded by Willy as a symbol of success which he wants for himself and his sons.</p><p>•	<strong>The Woman</strong></p><p>A woman, who Willy at times refers to as "Miss Francis", with whom he cheated on Linda. This woman was Will’s mistress during the time when Happy and Biff were still in high school. Her attention boosted Willy’s ego. When Biff caught Willy with The Woman, he lost faith in his father.</p><p></p><p>To know more information about the play <strong>Death of a Salesman</strong>, you may visit these links:</p><p>•	<strong>Willy Loman’s Depression in Death of a Salesman</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1316621</p><p>•	<strong>Summary of the Death of a Salesman</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1409896</p><p>•	<strong>Review on the Death of a Salesman</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1381946</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Willy just got home from a business trip and his wife Linda is excited to meet him. Though tired and confused, Willy still has the energy to Linda what had happened on his way going home. In Denial of being engaged in an accident, he kept on telling Linda that nothing had happened but later admitted that he almost hit a boy. To lighten up the issue, Linda suggests that he should go and ask his employer a job that would no longer require him to travel or does not take long driving. But the issue remains unsettled since Willy never reacts on Linda's suggestion. Then, Linda inform Willy that their sons go out have some bonding. She asked Willy not to be too stiff with Biff since Willy took him as lazy bum. However, Linda never agrees and just say that Biff just admires his father the most that is why whatever he perceives Biff to be is just a reflection of how Biff sees his father. Willy in order not to be bugged by their sons' behaviors, he just go and reminisce their childhood where he always woke them up in order to begin the day.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            21. the death of a salesman​</h2><br />
                        <p>Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman addresses loss of identity and a man's inability to accept change within himself and society. The play is a montage of memories, dreams, confrontations, and arguments, all of which make up the last 24 hours of Willy Loman's life. The play concludes with Willy's suicide and subsequent funeral.</p><p>Miller uses the Loman family — Willy, Linda, Biff, and Happy — to construct a self-perpetuating cycle of denial, contradiction, and order versus disorder. Willy had an affair over 15 years earlier than the real time within the play, and Miller focuses on the affair and its aftermath to reveal how individuals can be defined by a single event and their subsequent attempts to disguise or eradicate the event. For example, prior to discovering the affair, Willy's son Biff adored Willy, believed all Willy's stories, and even subscribed to Willy's philosophy that anything is possible as long as a person is "well-liked." The realization that Willy is unfaithful to Linda forces Biff to reevaluate Willy and Willy's perception of the world. Biff realizes that Willy has created a false image of himself for his family, society, and even for himself.</p><p>Willy is not an invincible father or a loyal husband or a fantastically successful salesman like he wants everyone to believe. He is self-centered. He fails to appreciate his wife. And he cannot acknowledge the fact that he is only marginally successful. Hence, Willy fantasizes about lost opportunities for wealth, fame, and notoriety. Even so, it would be incorrect to state that Miller solely criticizes Willy. Instead, Miller demonstrates how one individual can create a self-perpetuating cycle that expands to include other individuals. This is certainly the case within the Loman family. Until the end of the play, Willy effectively blocks the affair out of his memory and commits himself to a life of denial. He cannot remember what happened, so naturally he does not understand why his relationship with Biff has changed. Willy wants Biff's affection and adoration as before, but instead the two constantly argue. Willy vacillates, sometimes criticizing Biff's laziness and ineptitude, other times praising his physical abilities and ambition.</p><p>Willy's despair results from his failure to achieve his American dream of success. At one point, Willy was a moderately successful salesman opening new territory in New England, and Biff and Happy viewed him as a model father. Once Biff discovers the affair, however, he loses respect for Willy as well as his own motivation to succeed. As Willy grows older, making sales is more difficult for him, so he attempts to draw on past success by reliving old memories. Willy loses the ability to distinguish reality from fantasy, and this behavior alienates him from others, thereby diminishing his ability to survive in the present. As the play progresses, Willy's life becomes more disordered, and he is forced to withdraw almost completely to the past, where order exists because he can reconstruct events or relive old memories.</p><p>The play continues to affect audiences because it allows them to hold a mirror up to themselves. Willy's self-deprecation, sense of failure, and overwhelming regret are emotions that an audience can relate to because everyone has experienced them at one time or another. Although most do not commit suicide in the face of adversity, people connect with Willy because he is a man driven to extreme action. An audience may react with sympathy toward Willy because he believes he is left with no other alternative but to commit suicide. On the other hand, an audience may react with disgust and anger toward Willy, believing he has deserted his family and taken the easy way out.</p><p>Either way, individuals continue to react to Death of a Salesman because Willy's situation is not unique: He made a mistake — one that irrevocably changed his relationship with the people he loves most — and when all of his attempts to eradicate his mistake fail, he makes one grand attempt to correct the mistake. Willy vehemently denies Biff's claim that they are both common, ordinary people, but ironically, it is the universality of the play that makes it so enduring. Biff's statement, "I'm a dime a dozen, and so are you" is true after all.</p><br />
