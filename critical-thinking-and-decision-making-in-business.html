Show complete solution You may not see the immediate use of discriminant in your daily life because we do not usually use quadratic equations daily, but these concepts could help us when we enter certain fields like business and planning. In a way, quadratic equation and its discriminant helps in developing critical thinking skills and decision making. The situation below is an example of real-life problems involving quadratic equation and its discriminant Problem: A carpenter is commissioned to build a chalk board with an area of 50 square feet. The client wants the length to be 5 feet longer than its width. Is it possible?(sa picture po)  Use these questions to easily solve the problem. 1. Write the mathematical sentence that represents the area of the chalk board. 2. Simplify the equation and write it in standard form of quadratic equation 3. Solve the discriminant of the quadratic equation in #2. 4. Is the discriminant a positive or a negative? 5. To answer whether the client's request is possible or not, we need to go back to the discriminant. If you are to get the square root of the discriminant in #3, is there a possible value that can represent the width of the board? If there is, then the client's request is possible. If otherwise, then it is not possible.​</a>

                            8. PERFORMANCE TASK Solve the problem. Write your answers inside the box. Show complete solution You may not see the immediate use of discriminant in your daily life because we do not usually use quadratic equations daily, but these concepts could help us when we enter certain fields like business and planning. In a way, quadratic equation and its discriminant helps in developing critical thinking skills and decision making. The situation below is an example of real-life problems involving quadratic equation and its discriminant Problem: A carpenter is commissioned to build a chalk board with an area of 50 square feet. The client wants the length to be 5 feet longer than its width. Is it possible?(sa picture po)  Use these questions to easily solve the problem. 1. Write the mathematical sentence that represents the area of the chalk board. 2. Simplify the equation and write it in standard form of quadratic equation 3. Solve the discriminant of the quadratic equation in #2. 4. Is the discriminant a positive or a negative? 5. To answer whether the client's request is possible or not, we need to go back to the discriminant. If you are to get the square root of the discriminant in #3, is there a possible value that can represent the width of the board? If there is, then the client's request is possible. If otherwise, then it is not possible.​</h2><br />
