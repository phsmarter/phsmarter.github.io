                                            PAKI ANSWER PO PLSSIn 1942. While hiding from the German Nazis in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Anne Frank wrote the following entry in her diary. Read the Diary entry below.October 9th 1942. “Today I have nothing but dismal and depressing news to report.  Our many Jewish friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves. The Gestapo is  treating them very roughly Today I have nothing but dismal and depressing news to report. Our many Jewish friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves. The Gestapo is treating them very roughly and transporting them in cattle cars to Westerbork, the big camp in Drenthe to which they're sending all the Jews. Miep told us about someone who'd managed to escape from there. It must be terrible in Westerbork. The people get almost nothing to eat, much less to drink, as water is available only one hour a day, and there's only one toilet and sink for several thousand people. Men and women sleep in the same room, and women and children often have their heads shaved. Escape is almost impossible; many people look Jewish, and they're branded by their shorn heads.If it's that bad in Holland, what must it be like in those faraway and uncivilized places where the Germans are sending them? We assume that most of them are being murdered. The English radio says they're being gassed. Perhaps that's the quickest way to die. I feel terrible. Miep's accounts of these horrors are so heartrending, and Miep is also very distraught. The other day, for instance, the Gestapo deposited an elderly, crippled Jewish woman on Miep's doorstep while they set off to find a car. The old woman was terrified of the glaring searchlights and the guns firing at the English planes overhead. Yet Miep didn't dare let her in. Nobody would. The Germans are generous enough when it comes to punishment.Bep is also very subdued. Her boyfriend is being sent to Germany. Every time the planes fly over, she's afraid they're going to drop their entire bomb load on Bertus's head. Jokes like "Oh, don't worry, they can't all fall on him" or "One bomb is all it takes" are hardly appropriate in this situation. Bertus is not the only one being forced to work in Germany. Trainloads of young men depart daily. Some of them try to sneak off the train when it stops at a small station, but only a few manage to escape unnoticed and find a place to hide.But that's not the end of my lamentations. Have you ever heard the term "hostages"? That's the latest punishment for saboteurs. It's the most horrible thing you can imagine. Leading citizens -- innocent people -- are taken prisoner to await their execution. If the Gestapo can't find the saboteur, they simply grab five hostages and line them up against the wall. You read the announcements of their death in the paper, where they're referred to as "fatal accidents.'Fine specimens of humanity, those Germans, and to think I'm actually one of them! No, that's not true, Hitler took away our nationality long ago. And besides, there are no greater enemies on earth than the Germans and the Jews.Instruction: Answer the following questions about Anne Frank’s diary entry above.1.Make a list of all the adjectives and adverbs that you find in the diary entry. What do these words reveal about the emotional state of the writer? 2. Comment on the way the diary entry was organized. How is this diary entry the same or different from another piece of writing such as an explanation essay? 3. Comment on the tone of the diary entry. How is it different from the tone used in an explanation essay? PAKI ANSWER PO PLSS ​</a>

Winners of pageants such as Miss America are icons, representations of the ideal woman, and positive role models for young girls. So, society says. More recently, however, a new type of pageant has increased in popularity to the point of being considered a national phenomenon. These pageants are just as glitzy, and the competition is just as fierce; the only difference is that these contestants are the miniature model. They are child beauty queens. The world of child beauty pageants has become a source of fascination, as well as contention, in our society. Networks such as TLC and WE TV have produced hit reality shows featuring the munchkin-sized divas because it sells, but one cannot help but wonder, how can parading children about on stage like show ponies be a positive thing? The truth is it is not. Beauty pageants are not a healthy activity for children because they force young girls to act like little adults, exhibit age-inappropriate sexuality, and have negative body image and mental health problems later in their lives. Children are the future of society, and even those who do not have children should be concerned about the direction of the culture they have to live in. Just because child beauty pageants are socially acceptable does not mean they should be. Our culture needs to eliminate child beauty pageants, at least in their current form. ​</a>

Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</a>

                                            "Are You A Carrot, Egg or Coffee Bean?" A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved a new one arose. Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water. In the first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil without saying a word. In about twenty minute she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee into a bowl. Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me what you see?" "Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied. She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. She then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled, as she tasted its rich aroma. The daughter then asked, "What's the point, mother?" Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity... boiling water - but each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior. But, after being through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling water they had changed the water. "Which are you?" she asked the daughter. "When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?" Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength? Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after death, a break up, a financial hardship, or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and a hardened heart? Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you. When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest do you elevate to another level? How do you handle adversity? ARE YOU A CARROT, AN EGG, OR A COFFEE BEAN?make an essay using this guide questions:1. what is the story about?2. what message does it convey?3. as a family how can you apply the lessons you learned from the story?​</a>

Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</a>

Captain America. Superman. Wonder Woman. These are famous superheroes that have kept their worlds safe, but they have also helped our world. The idea of superheroes has greatly benefited society by giving them creativity, confidence, and courage. Children usually dress up as superheroes during Halloween, or even on a regular basis. They do this not simply because they find their costumes, gadgets, and superpowers cool, but also because they look up to these superheroes as roles models. There must be something more than gadgets for these kids to admire superheroes and nor supervillains. The reason is because these superheroes are good. Not only do they fight the bad guys, but also they have the capability of bringing the best in us.

“Are Men More Creative Than Women?”
Throughout history it has been men, for the most part, who have engaged in public life. Men have sought for public achievement and recognition, while women obtained their main satisfactions by bearing and rearing children. In women’s eyes, public achievement makes a man more attractive as a marriage partner. But for men the situation is reversed. The more a woman achieves publicly, the less desirable she seems as a wife. There are three possible positions one can tackle about male and female creativity. The first is that males are inherently more creative in all fields. The second is that if it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males. If this were the case, then if men were permitted the enjoyment women have always had in rearing young children, male creativity might be reduced also. (There is some indication in the United States today that this is so.) The third possible position is that certain forms of creativity are more congenial to one sex than to the other and that the great creative acts will therefore come from only one sex in a given field. (Mozaic, 1985) “If it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males”
Paraphrased text:
Men and women throughout the years has one noticeable is their creativity. There have been arguments and debates to what limits a woman's creativity since men have been dominant in this category or so they say. They say that women are limited due to time being taken by the children they are raising, if that would not be the case for men they said that men creativity would fluctuate. It is stated from a quote (Mozaic, 1985) "If it were not for the greater appeal of crafting and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males". Although the creativity of a man or woman's affects their social status, it can be said that throughout our era this has been changing making women prove they are more than what they were.

“Essays”
There are two kinds of essay, the formal essay and the informal essay, often called the personal essay. A formal essay is is more carefully organized and more serious than a personal essay. Formal essays were developed by Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman of the mid 1950’s and early 1600s. His essays are short, impersonal, and informative, and they discuss such subjects as death, fear, truth, and wealth. A personal essay is written in casual, conversational style. The chief characteristics of the personal essay is its informality. Its purpose is first to interest and only incidentally to inform. Consequently, it is a more artistic and a less utilitarian form of a composition than the formal essay.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The essence of being a woman is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been debated and explored throughout history. It is a question that has been asked by countless women and men, and the answer often varies depending on cultural, societal, and personal perspectives. In this essay, we will explore the essence of being a woman, examining various perspectives and highlighting the unique qualities and experiences that make up the essence of womanhood.</p><p></p><p>Biologically, being a woman is defined by the presence of two X chromosomes, which result in the development of female reproductive organs and secondary sex characteristics such as breasts and a higher-pitched voice. However, the essence of being a woman extends far beyond biology. It is shaped by societal, cultural, and personal experiences that shape a woman's identity and perspective.</p><p></p><p>One aspect of the essence of being a woman is the experience of femininity. Femininity is often associated with qualities such as empathy, nurturing, and sensitivity, as well as physical characteristics such as long hair and curves. However, these qualities can vary greatly depending on cultural and societal norms. In some cultures, assertiveness and independence are valued over traditional feminine qualities, while in others, femininity is seen as essential to a woman's identity.</p><p></p><p>Another aspect of the essence of being a woman is the experience of motherhood. While not all women are mothers, the ability to bear children is often seen as a defining characteristic of womanhood. The experience of pregnancy, childbirth, and raising children can be a transformative experience that shapes a woman's identity and perspective on the world.</p><p></p><p>The experience of womanhood is also shaped by societal and cultural expectations. Women are often expected to be caregivers, nurturers, and homemakers, while men are expected to be providers and protectors. These gender roles are deeply ingrained in many cultures and can have a significant impact on a woman's sense of self-worth and identity.</p><p></p><p>However, the essence of being a woman is not limited to these traditional gender roles.

                            5. PAKI ANSWER PO PLSSIn 1942. While hiding from the German Nazis in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Anne Frank wrote the following entry in her diary. Read the Diary entry below.October 9th 1942. “Today I have nothing but dismal and depressing news to report.  Our many Jewish friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves. The Gestapo is  treating them very roughly Today I have nothing but dismal and depressing news to report. Our many Jewish friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves. The Gestapo is treating them very roughly and transporting them in cattle cars to Westerbork, the big camp in Drenthe to which they're sending all the Jews. Miep told us about someone who'd managed to escape from there. It must be terrible in Westerbork. The people get almost nothing to eat, much less to drink, as water is available only one hour a day, and there's only one toilet and sink for several thousand people. Men and women sleep in the same room, and women and children often have their heads shaved. Escape is almost impossible; many people look Jewish, and they're branded by their shorn heads.If it's that bad in Holland, what must it be like in those faraway and uncivilized places where the Germans are sending them? We assume that most of them are being murdered. The English radio says they're being gassed. Perhaps that's the quickest way to die. I feel terrible. Miep's accounts of these horrors are so heartrending, and Miep is also very distraught. The other day, for instance, the Gestapo deposited an elderly, crippled Jewish woman on Miep's doorstep while they set off to find a car. The old woman was terrified of the glaring searchlights and the guns firing at the English planes overhead. Yet Miep didn't dare let her in. Nobody would. The Germans are generous enough when it comes to punishment.Bep is also very subdued. Her boyfriend is being sent to Germany. Every time the planes fly over, she's afraid they're going to drop their entire bomb load on Bertus's head. Jokes like "Oh, don't worry, they can't all fall on him" or "One bomb is all it takes" are hardly appropriate in this situation. Bertus is not the only one being forced to work in Germany. Trainloads of young men depart daily. Some of them try to sneak off the train when it stops at a small station, but only a few manage to escape unnoticed and find a place to hide.But that's not the end of my lamentations. Have you ever heard the term "hostages"? That's the latest punishment for saboteurs. It's the most horrible thing you can imagine. Leading citizens -- innocent people -- are taken prisoner to await their execution. If the Gestapo can't find the saboteur, they simply grab five hostages and line them up against the wall. You read the announcements of their death in the paper, where they're referred to as "fatal accidents.'Fine specimens of humanity, those Germans, and to think I'm actually one of them! No, that's not true, Hitler took away our nationality long ago. And besides, there are no greater enemies on earth than the Germans and the Jews.Instruction: Answer the following questions about Anne Frank’s diary entry above.1.Make a list of all the adjectives and adverbs that you find in the diary entry. What do these words reveal about the emotional state of the writer? 2. Comment on the way the diary entry was organized.

Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</h2><br />

                            9. "Are You A Carrot, Egg or Coffee Bean?" A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved a new one arose. Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water. In the first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil without saying a word. In about twenty minute she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee into a bowl. Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me what you see?" "Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied. She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. She then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled, as she tasted its rich aroma. The daughter then asked, "What's the point, mother?" Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity... boiling water - but each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior. But, after being through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling water they had changed the water. "Which are you?" she asked the daughter. "When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?" Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength? Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after death, a break up, a financial hardship, or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and a hardened heart? Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you. When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest do you elevate to another level? How do you handle adversity?

She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince.

He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first.

                            12. Directions: Read and understand the essay. Summarize the key points using the cause-and-effect diagram found below. Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</h2><br />

Captain America. Superman. Wonder Woman. These are famous superheroes that have kept their worlds safe, but they have also helped our world. The idea of superheroes has greatly benefited society by giving them creativity, confidence, and courage. Children usually dress up as superheroes during Halloween, or even on a regular basis. They do this not simply because they find their costumes, gadgets, and superpowers cool, but also because they look up to these superheroes as roles models. There must be something more than gadgets for these kids to admire superheroes and nor supervillains. The reason is because these superheroes are good. Not only do they fight the bad guys, but also they have the capability of bringing the best in us. This essay will discuss the history of superheroes, the difference between superheroes and other fictional characters, and how all these things have positively affected society (Suarez, 2012). ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________​</h2><br />

“Are Men More Creative Than Women?”
Throughout history it has been men, for the most part, who have engaged in public life. Men have sought for public achievement and recognition, while women obtained their main satisfactions by bearing and rearing children. In women’s eyes, public achievement makes a man more attractive as a marriage partner. But for men the situation is reversed. The more a woman achieves publicly, the less desirable she seems as a wife. There are three possible positions one can tackle about male and female creativity. The first is that males are inherently more creative in all fields. The second is that if it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males. If this were the case, then if men were permitted the enjoyment women have always had in rearing young children, male creativity might be reduced also. (There is some indication in the United States today that this is so.) The third possible position is that certain forms of creativity are more congenial to one sex than to the other and that the great creative acts will therefore come from only one sex in a given field. (Mozaic, 1985) “If it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males”
Paraphrased text:
Men and women throughout the years has one noticeable is their creativity. There have been arguments and debates to what limits a woman's creativity since men have been dominant in this category or so they say. They say that women are limited due to time being taken by the children they are raising, if that would not be the case for men they said that men creativity would fluctuate. It is stated from a quote (Mozaic, 1985) "If it were not for the greater appeal of crafting and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males". Although the creativity of a man or woman's affects their social status, it can be said that throughout our era this has been changing making women prove they are more than what they were.

“Essays”
There are two kinds of essay, the formal essay and the informal essay, often called the personal essay. A formal essay is is more carefully organized and more serious than a personal essay. Formal essays were developed by Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman of the mid 1950’s and early 1600s. His essays are short, impersonal, and informative, and they discuss such subjects as death, fear, truth, and wealth. A personal essay is written in casual, conversational style. The chief characteristics of the personal essay is its informality. Its purpose is first to interest and only incidentally to inform. Consequently, it is a more artistic and a less utilitarian form of a composition than the formal essay.</h2><br />

Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman who lived between the mid-1950s and the early 1600s, is credited with creating the formal essay. His works cover topics like death, fear, truth, and riches and are condensed, impartial, and informed. The writing style of a personal essay is informal and conversational. The informality of the personal essay is one of its main qualities. Its primary goal is to pique interest, with informational value coming second. As a result, compared to the formal essay, it is a more aesthetic and less practical type of production.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
