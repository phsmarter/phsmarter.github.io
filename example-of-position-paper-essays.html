Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W. Shwalb, Barbara J. Shwalbhttps://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/dshwalb/files/ CAD114Chapter1.pdfAfter reading the two excerpts above, answer the following questions.

                                            DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are ef- fective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016," they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of peo- ple with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invest- ed in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smok- ing. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff. Week 10: Page 14 of 20 Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous pas- sive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age. To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there. As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their danger- ous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day be- come more obvious to them too. https://chiefessays.net/position-essay-examples-to-help-you-grasp-the-idea/ Guide Questions: 1.

                            6. What does respect have to do with you and with others?Find out more by reading the two excerpts. Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W.

                            14. DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are ef- fective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016," they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of peo- ple with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invest- ed in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smok- ing. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff. Week 10: Page 14 of 20 Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous pas- sive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age. To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there. As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their danger- ous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day be- come more obvious to them too. https://chiefessays.net/position-essay-examples-to-help-you-grasp-the-idea/ Guide Questions: 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The position paper is about whether anti-smoking ad campaigns really help or not. </p><p>2. The writer's evidences/reasons are that according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers has dropped significantly in recent years, their ads can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff, and they can help parents realize how dangerous passive smoking is for their kids. </p><p>3. If I were the writer, my stand would be that anti-smoking ad campaigns are effective because they are able to motivate people to quit smoking and help parents realize the dangers of passive smoking for their kids. The evidence provided by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention also suggests that the number of smokers has declined significantly in the past decade, suggesting that the campaigns are having a positive impact.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
