                            2. essay about power of literacy​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The word ‘literacy’ means an ability to read and write. In a civilized country, every citizen should learn how to read and write. If not, he is called an illiterate person. An illiterate person has to face many practical difficulties in life.</p><p></p><p>As he is unable to read or write, he cannot read a letter addressed to him by his near and dear ones. He cannot calculate his own income and expenses, nor can keep his own accounts. Morally and psychologically, he feels insecure and weak, and hence suffers from an inferiority complex.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, every person in the society should try to become literate. If it was not possible in an early age, a grown-up man can yet learn how to read and write in his advanced stage of life. Literacy will help him also in gaining common knowledge in various subjects, which will make him a “complete man.</p><p></p><p>An illiterate man is generally exploited by the clever men in the society. They take full advantage of his ignorance of the language or wisdom. The illiterate men become like dancing dolls at the hands of the clever persons. They suffer in many ways in life.</p><p></p><p>Now-a-days, the Indian governments have taken a litera­cy drive all over the country. They are sending teachers into the remote corners of the villages of India in order to educate the people, irrespective of their age or profession.</p><p></p><p>The programme of education has taken a bold step, and the results are encouraging. The students and the educated youth should come forward to join the literacy movement since launched by the government of India.</p><p></p><p>Classes can be held in a primary school or in any other suitable place that is available in the area chosen for literacy movement. Teaching can be arranged in the morning or in the evening.</p><p>The students may be peasants, mill workers, or traders, the poor or the rich. Education must be free and vol­untary. The students are to be supplied with the books, and taught first how to read them, and then, how to write the scripts, imitating the printed letters in the books.</p><p></p><p>It has been seen that the people of India have remark­ably responded to this drive, and shown great interest in adult education, apart from the education of the young ones.</p><p></p><p>The percentage of literate persons in India has considerably increased in comparison with the figures of the earlier years. It is found that in the villages, the young and the old men and women assemble and sit together to take lessons from the teachers who have been specially trained and appointed for the purpose of teaching the illiterate mass.</p><p></p><p>The students should also come forward voluntarily to actively participate in this noble literacy drive and make their country free from the curse of illiteracy.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            7. What is edsa people power revolution essay ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The EDSA People Power Revolution is a significant event in the history of the Philippines. It was a peaceful revolution that took place from February 22-25, 1986, which led to the ousting of President Ferdinand Marcos and the restoration of democracy in the country.</p><p></p><p>The revolution was sparked by the results of the snap presidential elections held on February 7, 1986. The results showed that Marcos had won the elections, but allegations of fraud and irregularities led to massive protests from opposition groups, including the Catholic Church, civil society organizations, and the military.</p><p></p><p>The protests culminated in a historic event that became known as the EDSA People Power Revolution. Hundreds of thousands of people gathered along EDSA, the main thoroughfare in Metro Manila, to protest against Marcos and his regime. The protesters came from all walks of life, including religious leaders, students, workers, and the middle class.</p><p></p><p>The protests were peaceful, and the military, under the leadership of Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and General Fidel Ramos, joined the protesters in their call for change. The military's support was crucial, as it provided protection for the protesters and helped to ensure that the demonstrations remained peaceful.</p><p></p><p>After four days of protests, Marcos was forced to flee the country, and Corazon Aquino, the widow of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr., was installed as the new president. The EDSA People Power Revolution became a symbol of the power of nonviolent resistance and the triumph of democracy over authoritarianism.</p><p></p><p>The EDSA People Power Revolution has had a lasting impact on the Philippines and the world. It served as an inspiration for other peaceful revolutions in other parts of the world, including in Eastern Europe and Latin America. It also paved the way for the restoration of democracy in the Philippines, leading to the drafting of a new constitution and the establishment of democratic institutions.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the EDSA People Power Revolution is a testament to the power of ordinary people to effect change and the importance of upholding democracy and human rights. It is a reminder that through peaceful and nonviolent means, people can work together to create a better future for themselves and for their country</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>“With great power comes great responsibility” has a simple meaning; if you have the ability to do something, make sure that you do it for the good of others. </p><p>A lot of people think that, once they have some form of power, they can usually lord it over people and abuse it. History has a lot of people showing them becoming corrupted because of great power: Napoleon and Hitler are just a couple to name a few. Even in a small scale, we do see powerful people beat down on the weaker ones. Bullies, abusive spouses, and corrupt politicians are just a few examples of the kinds of people we see every day that use their power the wrong way,and if you have the ability to do something, make sure that you do it for the good of others. Highly admired people like Gandhi and Ninoy Aquino have done things that follow the spirit of this message. If you can stop something bad from happening, do it. You don’t have to be a superhero to follow those words of geek wisdom. It’s possible to do small actions that have a big impact in the world.”</p><br />

But in our quest to gain power we all tend to overlook the responsibilities accompanied with the power, in fact they hardly comes to our mind when we think of power. There is no fixed definition for power it has different meaning for different individuals but the fact remains they wield influence over people by virtue of power, and hence the reason it lures us.It is the lack of awareness or our tendency to look responsibility and power separately has created many problems by disturbing the order of society. Today the person in whom power is vested tends to enjoy all the power wielded in him but is not ready to accept the responsibility that comes with it. It is evident phenomena that no one comes to take responsibility of any wrong doing everybody tries to play a blame game especially in politic<br />

Since its inception in the early 70s, community organizing in the country has evolved over the years of experience. The book of Felipe Maglaya III (Ed dela Torre) entitled Organizing People for Power: A Manual for Organizers is a good introduction to the study community organizing. In its third edition, the book offers fresh ideas to suit the demands of contemporary times and at the same remain faithful to most of its philosophies since its first edition written in 1974. Although it never had a wider circulation due to political instability that time, the book became a household name in the community organizing circle. <strong><br /><br />Explanation:<br /></strong>Tama po ba?, Nasearch kolang po kasi, kung mali po paki correct nalang po, pls wag ireport answer ko kung mali.</p><br />

                        <p>Electromagnetism is a fundamental force in nature that plays a crucial role in the transmission of electric power from the power plant to the consumer. The process of transmitting electric power involves the conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy, which is then transported through a network of power lines and transformers to homes and businesses. In this essay, we will explore the fundamental principles of electromagnetism and their application in the transmission of electric power.</p><p></p><p>Electricity is generated at the power plant by rotating turbines that are driven by steam or water. These turbines are connected to generators, which convert the mechanical energy of the turbines into electrical energy. The generators consist of a rotating coil of wire, called the rotor, and a stationary coil of wire, called the stator. The stator is surrounded by a series of powerful magnets, which create a magnetic field that induces an electrical current in the rotor coil. As the rotor rotates, it produces a changing magnetic field, which in turn generates an alternating current in the stator coil.</p><p></p><p>The alternating current produced by the generator is then transported to the high-voltage transmission lines, which carry the power to substations located closer to the consumer. These transmission lines are typically made of aluminum or copper and are designed to minimize energy loss during the transfer of power. The flow of electricity through the transmission lines creates a magnetic field around the wires. This magnetic field is responsible for the interaction between the transmission lines and the surrounding environment, which can lead to power losses and other issues.</p><p></p><p>At the substations, the high-voltage electricity is transformed into lower-voltage electricity, which is then distributed to the consumer. This process involves the use of transformers, which are devices that use the principles of electromagnetism to change the voltage of the electricity. Transformers work by inducing a magnetic field in a coil of wire, which is then used to transfer energy to a second coil of wire. The voltage of the electricity is determined by the ratio of the number of turns in the two coils. For example, a transformer with a primary coil of 100 turns and a secondary coil of 10 turns would reduce the voltage of the electricity by a factor of 10.</p><p></p><p>Once the voltage of the electricity has been reduced, it is distributed to homes and businesses through a network of power lines and transformers. The electricity is consumed by various devices, such as lights, refrigerators, and computers, which convert the electrical energy into other forms of energy, such as light, heat, and motion.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, electromagnetism is a crucial component of the transmission of electric power from the power plant to the consumer. It is responsible for the conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy, the creation of magnetic fields around transmission lines, and the operation of transformers. Understanding the principles of electromagnetism is essential for ensuring the safe and efficient delivery of electricity to homes and businesses around the world.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The phrase "with great power comes great responsibility" is one that has become a timeless quote and has been used in various contexts to inspire people to take their roles and responsibilities seriously. The idea behind this quote is that those who are given great power, whether it is through leadership positions, positions of authority, or personal abilities, also have a corresponding responsibility to use that power in a responsible and ethical manner.</p><p></p><p>Leadership positions are one of the most common areas where this quote applies. CEOs, politicians, and other leaders have a great deal of power, and they have a responsibility to use that power to benefit their organization and the people they serve. In addition to their core duties, they must also take responsibility for their actions and the actions of their team members. By doing so, they can ensure that their organization operates ethically and responsibly, which in turn can lead to long-term success.</p><p></p><p>However, this quote is not limited to just those in positions of power. It also applies to everyone in their daily lives. For example, a person who has a talent for writing or music has the power to influence others through their art, and they have a responsibility to use that power in a positive and responsible way. Similarly, those who have the power of knowledge have a responsibility to share that knowledge with others in a way that is helpful and informative.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the quote "with great power comes great responsibility" is a call to action that encourages individuals to use their power and abilities in a positive and responsible manner. It reminds us that we are all connected and that the actions we take can have a significant impact on the world around us. By being mindful of our actions and taking responsibility for our power, we can create a better world for ourselves and those around us.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the greatest blessings for human life; however, nowadays humans fail to recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets, writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it. They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things. Therefore, people of the modern age should also learn something from people of yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The EDSA People's Power Revolution, also known as the EDSA Revolution or simply People Power, was a series of non-violent protests and demonstrations that took place in the Philippines from February 22 to 25, 1986. The revolution resulted in the overthrow of the authoritarian regime of President Ferdinand Marcos, and the restoration of democracy in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>The EDSA Revolution was triggered by the disputed results of the presidential election held on February 7, 1986, in which Marcos claimed victory over his opponent, Corazon Aquino. However, the opposition accused Marcos of cheating and electoral fraud, and massive protests erupted in the streets of Manila and other major cities.</p><p></p><p>The protests quickly grew in size and intensity, and soon included a broad coalition of civil society groups, religious organizations, and ordinary citizens from all walks of life. The protesters used a variety of creative tactics to express their discontent, such as forming human chains, singing patriotic songs, and waving flags and banners.</p><p></p><p>One of the most iconic moments of the EDSA Revolution was the "Yellow Revolution," in which thousands of people wore yellow ribbons to show their support for Aquino, whose campaign color was yellow. This symbol of unity and hope became a powerful tool for the protesters to rally around and express their desire for change.</p><p></p><p>Despite the peaceful nature of the protests, the Marcos regime responded with violence and repression. The military and police were ordered to disperse the protesters and suppress the demonstrations, leading to several instances of brutality and bloodshed.</p><p></p><p>However, the courage and determination of the protesters eventually proved too much for the regime to handle. On February 25, 1986, Marcos fled the country with his family and close allies, ending his 21-year rule over the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>The EDSA Revolution was a remarkable achievement for the Filipino people, who showed the world that change can be achieved through peaceful means. It was a triumph of democracy over dictatorship, and a testament to the power of collective action and solidarity.</p><p>PLAGIARISM IS NOT OKAY! although i cannot stop you. here is the essay i used about EDSA PEOPLE'S POWER<br /><br />The EDSA People Power Revolution is a significant moment in Philippine history. It is a four-day peaceful demonstration that toppled the 20-year authoritarian regime of President Ferdinand Marcos. The event took place from February 22 to 25, 1986, at the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA), one of the main highways in Metro Manila.</p><p></p><p>The People Power Revolution was a culmination of various factors that fueled the Filipino people's discontent towards the Marcos regime. Marcos' rule was marked by human rights abuses, political repression, and widespread corruption, which resulted in economic stagnation and a deteriorating standard of living for the majority of Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>The spark that ignited the revolution was the disputed 1986 Presidential Election, where Marcos was declared the winner despite widespread allegations of cheating. The opposition, led by Corazon Aquino, widow of the slain opposition senator Benigno Aquino Jr., mounted protests and called for peaceful demonstrations.</p><p></p><p>People from all walks of life, including students, nuns, businessmen, and military defectors, joined the call for change. They filled the streets and highways, singing, dancing, and holding peaceful rallies. The protesters called for Marcos' resignation and the restoration of democracy.</p><p></p><p>The military played a crucial role in the revolution, with some of the high-ranking officials withdrawing their support from Marcos and joining the opposition. The military's withdrawal of support led to a standoff between Marcos loyalists and the people's power demonstrators, with the situation escalating to a potential violent conflict.</p><p></p><p>However, the peaceful protesters remained steadfast, and through their unity, they were able to exert pressure on Marcos to step down. On February 25, 1986, Marcos fled the country with his family, leaving behind a power vacuum that was soon filled by Corazon Aquino, who became the Philippines' first female president.</p><p></p><p>The EDSA People Power Revolution serves as a testament to the power of the people's collective voice and the importance of peaceful demonstrations in effecting change. It is a reminder that democracy is a fundamental right that should be protected and cherished. The event continues to inspire Filipinos to fight for justice, freedom, and democracy and serves as a source of hope and inspiration for people around the world.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The environmental impacts of moving to different traction power sources have not been well studied in either developing countries or modern agriculture. This study assesses the environmental impact of the transition from animal to tractor power and vice versa. Three different scenarios are analyzed: a developing country context where draught animal power (DAP) is actually in use; a similar context where DAP is replaced by mechanical traction; and a developed country scenario where mechanical traction is replaced by DAP. The impact assessment focuses on global warming (GW) and primary energy consumption (PEC). The DAP system refers to an Indonesian case study where Peranakan Ongole cattle are used for work, together with the production of milk and meat, and fed with two forage-supplying alternatives. The mechanical traction system considers the cases of a two-wheel tractor (2WT) and a rear-wheel-drive tractor (4WT). In the first scenario, assessing DAP impacts for plowing through process subdivision and indirect impacts allocation to co-products, DAP has a consistent advantage regarding energy consumption, while for CO2eq emissions, performance is better only in the case of 2WT. In the second scenario, considering product equivalent systems, substituting DAP with tractor power and maintaining the same DAP livestock farming more than doubles the impact; only with the introduction of modern, specialized livestock farming is a reduction achieved. In the third scenario, replacing mechanical traction with DAP results in a greater than three-fold increase in impact for PEC and more than 17 times increase for GW. Further work on the influence of system definition and the socio-economic background would improve the estimates produced in this study.</p><p></p><p>SANA PO BRAINLIEST </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The debate over whether women are more powerful than men has been a topic of discussion for decades. While there are those who argue that men are the stronger and more dominant gender, there is evidence to suggest that women have inherent abilities that make them more powerful than men.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, women have demonstrated their strength and resilience in the face of significant challenges throughout history. Women have fought for equal rights, access to education and healthcare, and the right to vote, among other things. Despite facing discrimination and sexism, women have persevered and made significant progress in achieving gender equality. This resilience is evidence of their innate power.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, women have a unique ability to multitask and manage multiple responsibilities simultaneously. Women are often expected to balance family and career responsibilities, and many excel at doing so. This ability to juggle multiple responsibilities demonstrates the strength and adaptability of women.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, women have demonstrated their power and leadership skills in various industries and fields. Women have made significant contributions in science, technology, business, politics, and other areas traditionally dominated by men. Their achievements are evidence of their inherent power and ability to succeed in challenging environments.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, some argue that men are the stronger gender. Men have traditionally held positions of power and authority in society, and many believe that their physical strength and aggression make them more powerful than women.</p><p></p><p>However, it is important to recognize that physical strength is not the only measure of power. Women have strengths and abilities that are often overlooked or undervalued, such as emotional intelligence, empathy, and collaboration.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while there may be differences between men and women, it is clear that women have inherent abilities that make them powerful. Women have demonstrated their strength and resilience in the face of significant challenges, have a unique ability to multitask and manage multiple responsibilities simultaneously, and have made significant contributions in various industries and fields. It is time to recognize and celebrate the power of women and to promote gender equality in all aspects of society</p><br />
