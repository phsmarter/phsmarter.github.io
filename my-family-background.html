The man kicked and threw the poor cat out of his house. __ 4. There was plenty of food, and the music was playing. Everybody was having a good time. __ 5. He approached the task with sheer determination. He had studied his plans carefully, spent hours preparing and was sure of his approach. The hours he spent practicing were grueling and exhausting but he was ready. This was the year he would win the poster-making contest at school. __ 6. The night it happened was one we will never forget. The wind was screeching outside as rain pounded against the window. We had lost electricity hours ago and had nothing but candles to light the house. The battery powered radio we had was broadcasting a warning to lock your doors and stay inside. __ 7. The gym of the high school was brightly decorated. The red and white streamers covered the walls and heart shapes were scattered all over the floor. Red glitter was thrown on all the tables and love songs were playing in the background. The Valentine’s dance was about to begin.  __ 8. The door swings open to reveal a Christmas tree, alone in the middle of the room, sparkling with hundreds of lights. Silence greets me as I glance around the room. The fireplace is empty and the snowstorm howls outside the window. My family has gone and I am left alone with my thoughts.  __ 9. Lola sat on the old, lumpy couch crying. She could let it all out here, alone in her mother’s small, quiet apartment. The familiar walls were covered in rose pink wallpaper. Goldie, her mother’s eleventh fish, seemed to stare sympathetically at Lola through the fishbowl sitting on the counter. The smell of her mother’s vanilla candles comforted her aching heart. __  10.  There  is  no  one That  can  be  better Because  you  are  brilliant. There  is  nothing That  you  cannot  you  do Because  you  are  unbeatabl e. There  is  no  place That  you  cannot  go There  is  no  person Because  you  are  always  welcomed. That  can  hold  you  back Because  you  are  unstoppable​</a>

                                            WORKSHEET #.1 IN ENGLISH 9Prejudice refers to a preconceived opinion or feeling toward a person based solely on their affiliation with a group. This feelingmay be translated into action by discriminating against the person or members of the target group. An individual may beprejudiced against others based on factors such as race, age, gender, sexual crientation, class status, religion, nationality, andamongst other thingsExaniples:a) "I don't want Blacks living in my neighborhood!"b) "I don't want Jews owning businesses in my town!"c) "I don't want a Muslim community center in lower Manhattan!"These examples clearly show that there are prejudices going on. The statements prejudge against black people, Jews, andMuslims basically because of their race, nationality and religion Even though they have not done anything wrong yet, but becauseof their backgrounds, people tend to prejudge them and eventually discriminate them. These are very common in our society evenup to the present time.Another term that causes confusion and is often used interchangeably with "prejudice" is "bias". But these two termsdiffer from each other. Let's examine how it differs from the formerBias is a tendency to lean in a certain direction, either in favor of or against a particular thing. To be truly biased meansto lack a neutral viewpoint on a particular topic. Somewhere along the line, bias took on a negative connotation. If you're biasedtoward something, then you lean favorably toward it; you tend to think positively of it. Meanwhile, if you're biased againstsomething, then you lean negatively against it; you tend to think poorly of it.Examples:a) In other Christian sects, the preacher position is only given to niales and not to females.b) Sectarian schools only accept students who share the same religious beliefs.c) Sonie churches don't accept women who wear pants instead of dresses or skirts during their services.In the given examples, a certain group or people is given favor than the other. In number one, males are given morerower or authority than females. Number two, students who are interested to study in a school but don't share the same religioncan't be admitted. And lastly, women who want to attend church services aren't allowed to go if they don't wear the prescribedclothes for the said servicesANSWER THE FOLLOWING:Study and evaluate whether the given scenarios contain biases and prejudices. Write bias, prejudice, or none.1. Some Muslims are assumed to be terrorists and eventually being discriminated.2. Jews during the period of 'Hitler were sentenced to death because Hitler himself despised Jewish people.3. A teacher who gives good rating to her student who shares the same religious belief with her4. A married couple living in a new country where they are free to attend to any of their church services5. Tom Cruise's affiliation with Scientology prompts all kinds of negative press6. Not hiring someone because of their age or gender.7. Assuming someone is gay because of the way he acts.8. Bullying and discriminating someone with disability,9 Accepting exclusive me nbership of clubs where certain people are not allowed.10.

                            7. WORKSHEET #.1 IN ENGLISH 9Prejudice refers to a preconceived opinion or feeling toward a person based solely on their affiliation with a group. This feelingmay be translated into action by discriminating against the person or members of the target group. An individual may beprejudiced against others based on factors such as race, age, gender, sexual crientation, class status, religion, nationality, andamongst other thingsExaniples:a) "I don't want Blacks living in my neighborhood!"b) "I don't want Jews owning businesses in my town!"c) "I don't want a Muslim community center in lower Manhattan!"These examples clearly show that there are prejudices going on. The statements prejudge against black people, Jews, andMuslims basically because of their race, nationality and religion Even though they have not done anything wrong yet, but becauseof their backgrounds, people tend to prejudge them and eventually discriminate them. These are very common in our society evenup to the present time.Another term that causes confusion and is often used interchangeably with "prejudice" is "bias". But these two termsdiffer from each other. Let's examine how it differs from the formerBias is a tendency to lean in a certain direction, either in favor of or against a particular thing. To be truly biased meansto lack a neutral viewpoint on a particular topic. Somewhere along the line, bias took on a negative connotation. If you're biasedtoward something, then you lean favorably toward it; you tend to think positively of it. Meanwhile, if you're biased againstsomething, then you lean negatively against it; you tend to think poorly of it.Examples:a) In other Christian sects, the preacher position is only given to niales and not to females.b) Sectarian schools only accept students who share the same religious beliefs.c) Sonie churches don't accept women who wear pants instead of dresses or skirts during their services.In the given examples, a certain group or people is given favor than the other. In number one, males are given morerower or authority than females. Number two, students who are interested to study in a school but don't share the same religioncan't be admitted. And lastly, women who want to attend church services aren't allowed to go if they don't wear the prescribedclothes for the said servicesANSWER THE FOLLOWING:Study and evaluate whether the given scenarios contain biases and prejudices. Write bias, prejudice, or none.1. Some Muslims are assumed to be terrorists and eventually being discriminated.2. Jews during the period of 'Hitler were sentenced to death because Hitler himself despised Jewish people.3. A teacher who gives good rating to her student who shares the same religious belief with her4. A married couple living in a new country where they are free to attend to any of their church services5. Tom Cruise's affiliation with Scientology prompts all kinds of negative press6. Not hiring someone because of their age or gender.7. Assuming someone is gay because of the way he acts.8.
