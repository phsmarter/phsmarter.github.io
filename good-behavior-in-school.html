Your classmates think that she doesn’t deserve to be in your class simply because she doesn’t fit in. You know very well that your classmates’ behavior is unbecoming and that they should learn to accept anyone regardless of his/her life’s status. How will you let them realize that their acts are unacceptable? ​</a>

                                            Case Study – Mature , Effective, or Negative Personality? Nathan thinks he is the Beau Brummel (important and known person) of the school. During free period or at an informal coffee sessions, he is surrounded by three or five fellows who seem to be interested in everything he says. Nathan usual conversation revolves about his many girl friends and the dates he has with them. Of course, no one has ever seen him with a girl, and he has never been known to date anyone from his school. Nathan explains this by saying that his classmates do not attract him, and the school affairs do not interest him. “The girls here are too young. I like sophisticated girls.” Nathan is a good story teller, has a good sense of description and timing, and with a good audience is sometimes superb. However, Nathan is unaware that his friends look upon him as entertainer and believe nothing he says. Questions: What inferences (conclusion) can you draw from Nathan’s behavior regarding his social development? Are Nathan’s associates really friends when they encourage his behavior? Why? What inadequacies (lack of quality required) do you discern (recognize) about Nathan’s character and point of view from his behavior? What might a sincerely interested friend of Nathan’s do to get him improve his behavior?  State your overall reaction, comments and suggestions on this case.​</a>

                                            3. Being involved in after school sports and clubs is not a right. It is a privilege. Therefore, students have to meet eligibility requirements. If students have any “D”s or “F”s, they are not allowed to play. Also, if students have behavior issues in class, they cannot be on the team or in the club. Lastly, students need to keep good attendance. If students miss school, they most certainly cannot come to practice. Being on a team is a lot of responsibility. If students are not proving to be responsible, they will not be permitted to be in clubs or teams.

                            14. Case Study – Mature , Effective, or Negative Personality? Nathan thinks he is the Beau Brummel (important and known person) of the school. During free period or at an informal coffee sessions, he is surrounded by three or five fellows who seem to be interested in everything he says. Nathan usual conversation revolves about his many girl friends and the dates he has with them. Of course, no one has ever seen him with a girl, and he has never been known to date anyone from his school. Nathan explains this by saying that his classmates do not attract him, and the school affairs do not interest him. “The girls here are too young. I like sophisticated girls.” Nathan is a good story teller, has a good sense of description and timing, and with a good audience is sometimes superb. However, Nathan is unaware that his friends look upon him as entertainer and believe nothing he says. Questions: What inferences (conclusion) can you draw from Nathan’s behavior regarding his social development? Are Nathan’s associates really friends when they encourage his behavior? Why? What inadequacies (lack of quality required) do you discern (recognize) about Nathan’s character and point of view from his behavior?
