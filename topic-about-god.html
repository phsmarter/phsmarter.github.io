                            4. You heard people arguing about the formation of rainbows. Some of them suggest that it is a form of spirit from the gods or there is gold at the end of it. Using your knowledge from the topic, how would you correct their understanding about the formation of rainbows?​</h2><br />
                        Answer:Rainbows contain a continuum of around 1 million colors that are indistinguishable with the human eye. Instead, we can only really see seven color hues: Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.<br /><br /><br />Explanation: a rainbow is not much more than an “optical illusion” that only appears when a viewer is looking from just the right angle relative to the light source.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Women are entitled to enjoy the same human rights and fundamental freedoms as other individuals. International human rights treaties require State parties to take proactive steps to ensure that women’s human rights are respected by law and to eliminate discrimination, inequalities, and practices that negatively affect women’s rights. Under international human rights law, women may also be entitled to specific additional rights such as those concerning reproductive healthcare.</p><p></p><p>As a particularly vulnerable group, women have special status and protection within the United Nations and regional human rights systems. International human rights treaties prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender and also require States to ensure the protection and realization of women’s rights in all areas – from property ownership and freedom from violence, to equal access to education and participation in government.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>That's All</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Topic: My "New Normal" Learning Experience</p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our lives, and the way we learn is no exception. In this personal recount, I will share my experiences with the "new normal" of learning, which refers to the changes brought about by the pandemic in the educational system.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>Transition to Online Learning</p><p>When the pandemic hit, my school had to make a sudden transition from traditional face-to-face classes to online learning. It was a challenging adjustment, and there were some technical difficulties and internet connectivity issues that hindered the learning experience.</p><p></p><p>Modular Learning Experience</p><p>After several months of online classes, my school implemented a modular learning system, which involved self-directed learning with modules provided by the teachers. While it was more flexible, it required more discipline and self-motivation, which was a bit challenging for me.</p><p></p><p>Coping with Changes</p><p>I struggled to cope with the sudden changes in my learning environment, but I tried to adapt and make the most out of the situation. I had to learn new study habits and techniques to keep up with the pace of learning.</p><p></p><p>Positive Outcomes</p><p>Despite the challenges, I have also experienced some positive outcomes from the "new normal" of learning. For instance, online classes have enabled me to attend classes from the comfort of my home, saving me commuting time and allowing me to have more flexibility in my schedule.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The pandemic has disrupted our lives, but it has also taught us to adapt and be more resilient. I have learned to embrace the "new normal" of learning and make the most out of it. While I look forward to returning to face-to-face classes someday, I believe that the experiences and skills I have gained from the pandemic will serve me well in the future.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        Athena was a benevolent and the smartest Goddess in Greece, and even she knew that if she were to start a war with Poseidon for touching one of her maidens at her temple, the people would only see her as a monster and, instead of the monster being the God who took advantage of her devotee, it would be her name that was to be tarnished. <br /><br />Athena took pity on her maiden's wails, and with a kiss, Athena shared her power with the tainted maiden, the girl's hair turned into snakes that turned anyone into hard, cold stone if they were to glimpse at it, her smooth skin littered with bruises turned into snake scales cold to the touch, and her brown eyes turned into slits that would terrify anyone just from hearing it. <br /><br />Yet, the maiden did not feel cursed (contrary to the people's beliefs) the maiden felt powerful, like she could defend herself.<br /><br />And so, Medusa roamed Greece, turning the men who took advantage of woman into un-living stone. To the Greek men, Medusa was a monster, someone who deserved to burn in the Underworld; but the the women she saved, Medusa was a symbol of strength. <br />

Mutual trust between friends is a building block of a solid friendship that could last a lifetime.3.God’s GiftsA god's gift or charism is a concept in Christianity that refers to an endowment or extraordinary power given by the Holy Spirit.These are believed by followers to be supernatural graces which individual Christians need to fulfill the mission of the Church..In the narrowest sense, it is a theological term for the extraordinary graces given to individual Christians for the good of others and is distinguished from the graces given for personal sanctification, such as the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit and the fruit of the Holy Spirit.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Brainliest po<br />

                            21. Relate your reflection on this topic about the bible verse below.
1 Corinthians 6:19-20 – “Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price therefore honor God with your bodies.
Please, in your own reflection. DO NOT PLAGARIZE</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Paul is speaking to the Christians at Corinth about sexual immorality. Some people apparently believe that since our bodies will eventually perish and degrade, it doesn't matter what we do with them. They may argue that only our spirits matter. They might also argue that they were free to engage in any sexual expression they pleased. These incorrect teachings have been refuted by Paul. The notion that our bodies are unimportant is ultimately untrue. The Holy Spirit lives in the body of a Christian. In a way, Paul elevates our bodies to the status of temples, sacred places where God's Spirit resides. Every person who puts their faith in Christ for salvation receives the Holy Spirit. We carry His Spirit in our bodies in a mysterious way. With that in mind, Paul continues, "After all, they aren't truly our bodies."In the passage after that, he will write that God bought us. With the blood of Jesus, he paid the price for our salvation from sin. By becoming a curse Himself, Christ bought us out of the curse of living under Moses' law. In that sense, we became God's property when we came to Him via faith in Jesus. That's why we can't do anything we want with our bodies.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> ang haba sorry T^T</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>God, in monotheistic thought, is conceived of as the supreme being, creator deity, and principal object of faith.[1] God is usually conceived as being omnipotent (all-powerful), omniscient (all-knowing), omnipresent (all-present) and omnibenevolent (all-good) as well as having an eternal and necessary existence. These attributes are used either in way of analogy or are taken literally. God is most often held to be incorporeal (immaterial).[1][2][3] Incorporeality and corporeality of God are related to conceptions of transcendence (being outside nature) and immanence (being in nature) of God, with positions of synthesis such as the "immanent transcendence".</p><p>Some religions describe God without reference to gender, while others use terminology that is gender-specific and gender-biased. God has been conceived as either personal or impersonal. In theism, God is the creator and sustainer of the universe, while in deism, God is the creator, but not the sustainer, of the universe. In pantheism, God is the universe itself. Atheism is an absence of belief in God, while agnosticism deems the existence of God unknown or unknowable. God has also been conceived as the source of all moral obligation, and the "greatest conceivable existent".[1] Many notable philosophers have developed arguments for and against the existence of God.[4]</p><p></p><p>Monotheistic religions refer to their god using various names, some referring to cultural ideas about their god's identity and attributes. In ancient Egyptian Atenism, possibly the earliest recorded monotheistic religion, this deity was called Aten[5] and proclaimed to be the one "true" Supreme Being and creator of the universe.[6] In the Hebrew Bible and Judaism, the names of God include Elohim, Adonai, YHWH (Hebrew: יהוה‎) and others. Yahweh and Jehovah, possible vocalizations of YHWH, are used in Christianity. In the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, one God coexists in three "persons" called the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In Islam, the name Allah is used, while Muslims also use a multitude of titles for God. In Hinduism, Brahman is often considered a monistic concept of God.[7] In Chinese religion, Shangdi is conceived as the progenitor (first ancestor) of the universe, intrinsic to it and constantly bringing order to it. Other names for God </p><p></p><br />
