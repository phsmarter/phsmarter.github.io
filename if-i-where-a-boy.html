                                            The Boy Who Cried Wolf Once there was a shepherd boy who spent his days on the hills watching the sheep. The boy got bored and lonely on the hill all day with only the sheep for company. I know, he thought to himself. I will call out. Wolf!" and then the others will come running to help me and I will not be alone So, the boy called out, as loud as he could, Wolf Wolf". All the boys and men from his village came running. "Where is the woll?" they asked. "It ran off," the boy said. But one of the other boys stayed with him all the same, and he had company for the rest of the day. A few days later, the boy was feeling bored and lonely again. I would really like some company, he thought to himself. So once again he called out, Wolf Wolf!" and all the boys and men from his village came running. Again, he told them that the wolf had been frightened away by the sound of them coming. This time there was grumbling among the men, who didn't believe him. They were getting angry at having to drop their work and come running for no reason because of this foolish boy still as a precaution, they allowed one of the other boys to remain with him until it was time to bring the sheep back in the evening. A few days later, the boy was once again on the hill, tending his sheep, when he saw a real wolf skulking about the edges of his flock. The wolf was huge, and he had sharp, white teeth and bright, yellow eyes. The boy was very frightened. "Wolf Wolf" he cried out. Wolf!" But this time, no one came. The men in the village, who had become wise to the boy's trick, only laughed. There is no woll." they said to themselves. Meanwhile, the wolf ate all of the boy's sheep 21.

                        <p>The friction occurs between the skateboard and the pavement. This fluid friction is responsible for allowing the boy to move because the skateboard's wheels are able to grip onto the pavement's surface, creating a frictional force that propels the skateboard forward as the motion is transferred from the rider's feet to the wheels. Without this friction, the skateboard would not be able to move and the boy would remain stationary.</p><br />

                            11. The Boy Who Cried Wolf Once there was a shepherd boy who spent his days on the hills watching the sheep. The boy got bored and lonely on the hill all day with only the sheep for company. I know, he thought to himself. I will call out. Wolf!" and then the others will come running to help me and I will not be alone So, the boy called out, as loud as he could, Wolf Wolf". All the boys and men from his village came running. "Where is the woll?" they asked. "It ran off," the boy said. But one of the other boys stayed with him all the same, and he had company for the rest of the day. A few days later, the boy was feeling bored and lonely again. I would really like some company, he thought to himself. So once again he called out, Wolf Wolf!" and all the boys and men from his village came running. Again, he told them that the wolf had been frightened away by the sound of them coming. This time there was grumbling among the men, who didn't believe him. They were getting angry at having to drop their work and come running for no reason because of this foolish boy still as a precaution, they allowed one of the other boys to remain with him until it was time to bring the sheep back in the evening. A few days later, the boy was once again on the hill, tending his sheep, when he saw a real wolf skulking about the edges of his flock. The wolf was huge, and he had sharp, white teeth and bright, yellow eyes. The boy was very frightened. "Wolf Wolf" he cried out. Wolf!" But this time, no one came. The men in the village, who had become wise to the boy's trick, only laughed. There is no woll." they said to themselves. Meanwhile, the wolf ate all of the boy's sheep 21.
