If I moved, I would fall into the black pit. I was scared and cold. I tried to scream, but all you could hear was my echo. I was trying to feel my way without moving, but I couldn’t feel anything.

I screamed as loud as I could, but no one heard me. I tried to stop myself from falling, but I kept on falling. Then a hand from under me stopped me from falling; the hand that stopped me was my mother’s. What point of view is used by the author? Evidence/line from the text: What is the theme of the story?

The axles of our chariots touch: our short swords meet.Standards obscure the sun: the foe roll up like clouds. Arrows fall thick: the warriors press forward. They menace our ranks: they break our line. The left-hand trace-horse is dead: the one on the right is smitten.The fallen horses block our wheels: they impede the yoke-horses!"They grasp their jade drum-sticks: they beat the sounding drums.Heaven decrees their fall: the dread Powers are angry.The warriors are all dead: they lie on the moor-field. They issued but shall not enter: they went but shall not return. The plains are flat and wide: the way home is long.Their swords lie beside them: their blacks bows, in their hand. Though their limbs were torn, their hearts could not be repressed.They were more than brave: they were inspired with the spirit of "Wu."Steadfast to the end, they could not be daunted.Their bodies were stricken, but their souls have taken Immortality— Captains among the ghosts, heroes among the dead.IDENTIFY THE TITLESPEAKERAUTHOR PURPOSERHYTHMSOUNDFIGURE OF SPEECHVOICEMOODPLOT OF THE PROBLEM​</a>

                        <p><strong>: Answer ꒱꒱ ̣ ̟</strong></p><strong>_C  </strong>1. "Memory is to love what the saucer is to the cup." (The House in Paris, Elizabeth Bowen)It compares the relationship between a cup and saucer to that of love and memory: memory holds on to love, as a saucer holds the cup._C  2. "It has been well said that an author who expects results from a first novel is in a position similar to that of a man who drops a rose petal down the Grand Canyon of Arizona and listens for the echo." (Cocktail Time, P.G. Wodehouse)It compares the response to a writer's first novel to a petal dropping into the Grand Canyon; there's nothing to hear, no great acclaim.<strong>_!   </strong>3. She was as quiet as a church mouse.She is a mouse living in a church (incorrect). Saying "quiet as a church mouse" is only a metaphor to describe how quiet she is.<p></p><p></p><p></p><strong>_C  </strong>4. Life is like a race.It compares life to a race, that there is always a competition.<strong>_!   </strong>5. Finding a good man is like finding a needle in a haystack.It means that good people are in the haystack (incorrect). This statement means that finding a good man is difficult, which is similar to trying to look for a needle in a pile of hay.<strong>_C  </strong>6. How a doctor diagnoses diseases is like how a detective investigates crimes.A doctor is compared to a detective who investigates and tries to find the possible suspect; while he makes a diagnosis.<strong>_!   </strong>7. That couple is sweet as sugar.The couple tastes like sugar (incorrect). The explanation behind this is simple -- sugar is sweet, and the couple being described is as sweet as sugar. This analogy means that the couple looks good together and act lovingly toward each other.<strong>_C   </strong>8. They crowded very close about him, with their hands always on him in a careful, caressing grip, as though all the while feeling him make sure he was there. It was like men handling a fish that is still alive and may jump back into the water. (George Orwell, A Hanging)Orwell is describing the crowd's reaction to seeing a man hanged.<strong>_C  </strong>9. Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water.It compares the "fin of the shark" to "a black chip". Black chips are used in poker and are considered to hold a large sum of money.<strong>_!   </strong>10. She felt like a raft floating in the middle of a dark, endless ocean. Like her, the raft was floating along, alone, worn out, and unable to reach a steady place in which to settle.She feels really happy (incorrect). By using context clues like "dark, endless" and "alone, worn out...", we can conclude that she is in fact, the opposite of happy. She feels depressed and hopeless, ouch.​<p>—————————— /ᐠ｡ꞈ｡ᐟ\ ——————————</p><p><strong>        Click the link below to learn more!</strong></p><p>Definition and Importance of Analogy - https://brainly.ph/question/3966030</p><p></p><p>Work hard like a beaver, rest well like a sloth! ଘ(੭ˊᵕˋ)੭* ੈ✩‧₊˚</p><p>#BrainliestBunch</p><br />

The axles of our chariots touch: our short swords meet.Standards obscure the sun: the foe roll up like clouds. Arrows fall thick: the warriors press forward. They menace our ranks: they break our line. The left-hand trace-horse is dead: the one on the right is smitten.The fallen horses block our wheels: they impede the yoke-horses!"They grasp their jade drum-sticks: they beat the sounding drums.Heaven decrees their fall: the dread Powers are angry.The warriors are all dead: they lie on the moor-field. They issued but shall not enter: they went but shall not return. The plains are flat and wide: the way home is long.Their swords lie beside them: their blacks bows, in their hand. Though their limbs were torn, their hearts could not be repressed.They were more than brave: they were inspired with the spirit of "Wu."Steadfast to the end, they could not be daunted.Their bodies were stricken, but their souls have taken Immortality— Captains among the ghosts, heroes among the dead.IDENTIFY THE TITLESPEAKERAUTHOR PURPOSERHYTHMSOUNDFIGURE OF SPEECHVOICEMOODPLOT OF THE PROBLEM​</h2><br />
                        <p>Chuu Yuan's "Battle" is a<strong> war-themed poetry.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Title</strong>: Battle </p><p><strong>Speaker: </strong> Chuu Yuan</p><p><strong>Author Purpose:</strong> The two clans, whose entire lives are on the line, are the subject of the author's main attention. It utilizes sight as its primary sense and has a depressing, mournful tone. The author portrays the action of the conflict as though he is observing it from a distance. Chuu Yuan employs profound language to explain what happened during the conflict.</p><p><strong>Rhythm: </strong>The poem's formalist critique focused on the<strong> atrocities of war</strong>.</p><p><strong>Sound: </strong>"The sentries will shortly be stationed in their hiding places,</p><p>Their feet started to ice as they felt the first snow." These words from "The Battle" are soothing and simple to read. The soft fricative f sounds convey the misery that these warriors must be experiencing. Since the sentence must be read slowly due to the assonance of the extended 'ee' sounds, we are forced to picture their agony.</p><p><strong>Figure of Speech:</strong> The final <strong>metaphor</strong>, which states that the men are now machine gun fodder and are essentially corpses that "stiffened in their crimson hoods," is possibly the worst image in "Ihe Battle." Simpson conveys this information in an impersonal manner, which makes it all the more heartbreaking.</p><p><strong>Plot of the Problem:  </strong>The conflict between human intentions and the laws and behaviors of the physical universe serves as the plot of the issue.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>The Battle</strong>: https://brainly.ph/question/9600645</p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> Equality, in my opinion, is when people treat each other fairly. For example, when a man treats the woman as an equal instead of a weak thing to protect, that is equality. Opposite of that is when a person gets belittled just because he/she has a defect.</p><br />
