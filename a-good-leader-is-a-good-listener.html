                                            A. Activity 1: Listening to an Oration Listen closely as your teacher reads or plays an oratorical piece entitled "If God Should Go on Strike." Before listening to the complete text, read the first part of the text and write about the following: 1. 2. 3. Your guess as to what the speech is all about. A list of questions to help you prove your guess/inference. A brief note that might describe the speaker's thoughts and feelings expressed in the listening text. If God Should Go on Strike by Walt Hintley Orations are formal, inspiring speeches meant to call the listener to action. Officials and leaders often have to deliver these discourses. How good it is that God above has never gone on strike, Because He was not treated fair in things He didn't like, If only He'd given up and said, "That's it, I'm through!" "I've had enough of those on earth, so this is what I'll do."​</a>

Underline the correct word choices in the paragraph that follows.Some people say that being trustworthy and honest are the mostimportant qualities of a leader, but in my opinion there is an even (more /most) important quality. A person in high office must be (good / well) atcooperating with other people. If he or she isn't, I don't think he or shewill be able to do the job very (good / well). It is just (not hardly possible/ not possible) for one single person to read everything and consider allthe facts in every issue. He or she has to communicate (good / well) withother people. A good leader also has to be a good listener. Nothing (good/ well) can (never come / ever come) out of fighting among the peoplewho rule a country. A leader is (their / there) to unify and not to dividepeople.​</a>

                            5. A. Activity 1: Listening to an Oration Listen closely as your teacher reads or plays an oratorical piece entitled "If God Should Go on Strike." Before listening to the complete text, read the first part of the text and write about the following: 1. 2. 3. Your guess as to what the speech is all about. A list of questions to help you prove your guess/inference. A brief note that might describe the speaker's thoughts and feelings expressed in the listening text. If God Should Go on Strike by Walt Hintley Orations are formal, inspiring speeches meant to call the listener to action. Officials and leaders often have to deliver these discourses. How good it is that God above has never gone on strike, Because He was not treated fair in things He didn't like, If only He'd given up and said, "That's it, I'm through!" "I've had enough of those on earth, so this is what I'll do."​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Based on the first part of the text, it seems like the speech is about how we should be grateful that God has never gone on strike.</p><p></p><p>2. Some questions to help prove this guess or inference are:</p><p></p><p>• What are some things that we take for granted that God does for us?</p><p>• Can you think of any times where you've felt like God wasn't being fair to you? How did you handle it?</p><p>• How would the world be different if God did decide to go on strike?</p><p></p><p>3. The speaker in the text seems to be expressing a sense of gratitude and relief that God has never gone on strike.</p><p></p><br />
