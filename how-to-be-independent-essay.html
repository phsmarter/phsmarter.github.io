                                            Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he orshe cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 4 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses.

Introduction: Education is more than important than just learning in books and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score.a good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult.education may teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1 The biggest selling point for for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn how to learn it is not about the knowledge they accumulate .it is the way a child is thought how to learn things,a child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course but if that child has been taught how to learn,then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life otherwise that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because .he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things persuasive point 2 education teaches people how to reason and if they are taught how to reason well,then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance.for example there are lots of post and websites on the internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are ignorant people than never learned how to reason will lock at them.believe them and support them if a person taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the us taht have had childhood injections (most of them) amd then look at all the people with autism.They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in us would have autism.if a person taught how to reason then taht person then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke.they would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema.this sort of reasoning can be taught in schools,and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children's lives by not vaccinating them and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him persuasive point 4 conclusion if education is not seen as important,then one day it just will be all about,school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum.there will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this alreay happens in some cases).plus, without education teaching people how to how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate waht is fact from what is faulty evidence,then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under cut ignorant noises ​</a>

                                            Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just leaning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our socie:ty is the fact that it helps people learn how to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to learn" things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children's lives by not vaccinating them, and walk smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. ​</a>

A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 2: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate; it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 3 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 4 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism, then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke.

This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 5 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases).

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Propaganda Movement, reform and national consciousness movement that arose among young Filipino expatriates in the late 19th century. Although its adherents expressed loyalty to the Spanish colonial government, Spanish authorities harshly repressed the movement and executed its most prominent member, José Riza</p><p><strong>Explanation:In 1888 Filipino expatriate journalist Graciano López Jaena founded the newspaper La Solidaridad in Barcelona. Throughout its course, La Solidaridad urged reforms in both religion and government in the Philippines, and it served as the voice of what became known as the Propaganda Movement. One of the foremost contributors to La Solidaridad was the precocious José Rizal y Mercado. Rizal wrote two political novels—Noli me tangere (1887; Touch Me Not) and El filibusterismo (1891; The Reign of Greed)—which had a wide impact in the Philippines. López Jaena, Rizal, and journalist Marcelo del Pilar emerged as the three leading figures of the Propaganda Movement, and magazines, poetry, and pamphleteering flourished.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            9. Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he orshe cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 4 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses. ACTIVITY 2 Directions. From the essay #2, complete this organizer with persuasive points for each of the paragraphs following the thesis statement below. Write your answer in your notebook following the format below. Thesis statement: I will show you the two best reasons why education is important in our society hi po pahelp po please needed napo​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Why is Education Important in Our Society:<p>One of the benefits of education is that the educational system teaches us how to obtain and develop critical and logical thinking and make independent decisions. When children become adults, they are faced with a lot of challenging issues – pay off your student loans, get a job, buy a car and a house, provide for your family, etc. However, if one has spent years educating themselves, they should be able to make sound decisions on these various quandaries. Not only are people able to form their own opinions, but they are also good at finding solid and reliable arguments and evidence to back up and confirm their decisions. !!</p><br />

Alcohol advantages and disadvantages?</p><p></p><p>-Moderate alcohol consumption may provide some health benefits, such as: Reducing your risk of developing and dying of heart disease. Possibly reducing your risk of ischemic stroke (when the arteries to your brain become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow) Possibly reducing your risk of diabetes.</p><p>2. <strong>T</strong><strong>o enhance sociability, to increase power, to escape problems, to get drunk, for enjoyment, or for ritualistic reasons.</strong></p><p><strong>3.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Alcohol is known to be harmful to health in general, and well understood to increase the risk of violence, including intimate partner violence, injury and alcohol poisoning. At times of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, alcohol consumption can exacerbate health vulnerability, risk-taking behaviours, mental health issues and violence. The WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean reminds people that drinking alcohol does not protect them from COVID-19, and encourages governments to ensure implementation of a ban and/or reinforce regulations to limit alcohol availability during the pandemic.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps:) </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda) made landfall in the Philippines on 8 November 2013. Just over a year on, this article reflects on what the World Health Organisation (WHO)  the co-lead for the health cluster alongside the Philippines Department of Health (DoH)  has learnt, how these lessons have influenced the response over time and what this means for responses to health emergencies in the future. The article is based on internal information from WHOs own work, though it is hoped that the main findings will also be useful to other agencies.</p><p></p><p>Responding to multiple disasters</p><p></p><p>The first lesson is that national agencies and the international community need to be ready to respond to multiple natural disasters each year in the Philippines. The country is one of the worlds most disaster-prone. Typhoon Haiyan was the third crisis to hit the country in two months, following conflict in Zamboanga and an earthquake in Bohol, which combined displaced 750,000 people. This meant that response services including national and international agencies and the Philippine army were already stretched.</p><p></p><p>WHO Philippines has been working with the DoH to set up Emergency Operations Centres in vulnerable areas of the country, and to establish a gold, silver and bronze command system+</p><p> to direct disaster responses. The agency has also been restocking and pre-positioning medical supplies and equipment in anticipation of more natural disasters, and is developing toolkits with the DoH for emergency preparedness. These toolkits will provide guidance on procedures and practices to ensure a quick response in the aftermath of an emergency. Both national and local governments are working to ensure that health structures are disaster resilient.</p><br />

                            24. Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just leaning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our socie:ty is the fact that it helps people learn how to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to learn" things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children's lives by not vaccinating them, and walk smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. ​</h2><br />

                            25. Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Persuasive point 1: Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 2: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate; it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 3 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 4 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism, then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 5 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching Set A, Directions.

Lisa Maragakis, senior director of infection prevention at Johns Hopkins Medicine, shares these guidelines: </p><p></p><p>Avoid close contact with others.</p><p>It’s important to understand that the new coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person. If an infected person coughs or sneezes, their droplets can infect people nearby. That’s why it’s important to avoid close contact with others. Understand that people (including children) may be infected with the new coronavirus and have only mild symptoms.</p><p></p><p>Some measures you can take to avoid close contact with others include:</p><p></p><p>Stay home as much as possible and reduce visitors.</p><p>Practice physical distancing:</p><p>Stay at least six feet away from others in public places.</p><p>Call friends and family or visit by video.</p><p>Ask your employer if it’s possible to work from home.</p><p>Avoid people who appear sick.</p><p>Go grocery shopping and run errands during off-peak times.</p><p>Wear a face mask whenever you are in a public place where you will encounter other people. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can spread between people interacting in close proximity — for example, speaking, coughing, sneezing, or singing— even if those people do not symptoms. Learn more information about how masks help prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p><p></p><p>Practice good hygiene wherever you are.</p><p>The new coronavirus can survive for hours or even days on some surfaces. Touching a contaminated surface and then touching your face is one of the ways to become infected.</p><p></p><p>The virus is no longer detectable on plastic after 72 hours, and on stainless steel or cardboard after about 48 hours. With that in mind:</p><p></p><p>Wash your hands with soap and water frequently and thoroughly for at least 20 seconds, especially:</p><p>After being in public places and touching door handles, shopping carts, elevator buttons, etc.</p><p>After using the bathroom</p><p>Before preparing food</p><p>If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</p><p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, especially with unwashed hands.</p><p>If you cough or sneeze, do so in the bend of your elbow. If you use a tissue, throw it away immediately.</p><p>Take precautions if you are living with or caring for someone who is sick.</p><p>Wear a mask if you are caring for someone who has respiratory symptoms.</p><p>Clean counters, door knobs, phones and tablets frequently, using disinfectant cleaners or wipes.</p><p>If you feel sick, follow these guidelines:</p><p>Stay home if you feel sick unless you are experiencing a medical emergency such as severe shortness of breath or a very high fever.</p><p>Call your doctor or urgent care facility and explain your symptoms over the phone.</p><p>If you leave your home to get medical care, wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms.</p><p></p><p>pa brainliest po <br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The process by which Earth makes heat is called radioactive decay. It involves the disintegration of natural radioactive elements inside Earth – like uranium, for example. Uranium is a special kind of element because when it decays, heat is produced. It's this heat that keeps Earth from cooling off completely. </p><p></p><br />
