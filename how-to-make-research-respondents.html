If you believe that it is FALSE, then draw ☹️.1. Quantitative research is costly because of the large number of respondentsneeded and the number of questionnaires to be reproduced._2. A large number of data are used to show trends, relationships, or differencesamong variables and is one of the weaknesses of quantitative research.3. Reliable quantitative studies CANNOT be repeated to verify or confirm itscorrectness in another setting.4. Inquiry is closely linked with research because investigating or examining aphenomenon is how research is started.5. Quantitative research is NOT a scientific, experimental, or inductive mannerof thinking6. Research allows you to directly make a conclusion without ample datagathered using a problem-solving technique.7. Qualitative research uses structured research instruments like questionnairesto collect measurable characteristics of the respondents.8. Descriptive research is the design concerned with describing the nature,characteristics and components of the population or a phenomenon.9. Experimental Research is the systematic investigation of the nature ofrelationships, or associations between and among variables without necessarilyinvestigating into causal reasons underlying them10. A survey research is used to gather information from groups of people byselecting and studying samples chosen from a population.​​</a>

                                            Activity 2. Research: Fact or Bluff Directions: Read the following statement carefully. Write TRUE if the statement is correct; FALSE if not. 1. Quantitative research is not a scientific, experimental, or inductive manner of thinking. 2. A survey research is used to gather information from groups of people selecting and studying samples from population. 3. Quantitative research is costly because of the large number of respondents. 4. Experimental research is the systematic investigation of the nature of the relationships or associations between and among variables without necessarily investigating into casual reasons underlying them 5. Qualitative research uses structured research instruments like questionnaire to collect measurable characteristic of the respondents. 6. A large number of data are used to show trends, relationships, or differences among variables and is one of the weaknesses of quantitative research 7. Descriptive research is the design concerned with describing the nature, characteristics and components of the population or a phenomenon. 8. Reliable quantitative studies cannot be repeated to verify or confirm its correctness in another setting 9. Research allows you to directly make a conclusion without ample data gathered using a problem- solving technique. 10. Inquiry is closely linked with research because investigating or examining a phenomenon is how research is started.​</a>

Knowing the most common hazards in your area — particularly if you’re new to the region — can help you focus your preparation plans for each hazard.</p><p></p><p>For instance, ask yourself:</p><p></p><p>Is my area vulnerable to any natural hazards?</p><p>How often are these hazards likely to occur in my area?</p><p>Which of my assets would be affected?</p><p>To what extent would l be affected financially?</p><p>How would I recover if I did not have insurance?</p><p>How can each disaster be predicted or mitigated?</p><p>Local councils and emergency management authorities can help you identify risk in your area and outline the local plans and recommendations for each.</p><p></p><p>Once you have identified the disasters you are exposed to, it’s important to review your insurance policies and confirm your cover against various events. If you don’t have insurance, consider the types of policies you may require and the risks you need them to cover.</p><p></p><p>If you live in a flood or bushfire zone, it would be wise to insure your property accordingly. For example, if your home is next to a river or creek and your property is at risk of flooding, check your policy to see if you’re covered. If you’re unsure, contact your insurer to find out. </p><p></p><p>Many insurers will place embargoes on insurance when natural disasters are considered imminent. This means if a cyclone is heading your way you may not be able to purchase insurance cover until the insurer lifts restrictions on new policies. Embargoes prevent property owners buying insurance just before a disaster strikes and then cancelling once the risk has passed.</p><br />

                            10. Activity 2. Research: Fact or Bluff Directions: Read the following statement carefully. Write TRUE if the statement is correct; FALSE if not. 1. Quantitative research is not a scientific, experimental, or inductive manner of thinking. 2. A survey research is used to gather information from groups of people selecting and studying samples from population. 3. Quantitative research is costly because of the large number of respondents. 4. Experimental research is the systematic investigation of the nature of the relationships or associations between and among variables without necessarily investigating into casual reasons underlying them 5. Qualitative research uses structured research instruments like questionnaire to collect measurable characteristic of the respondents. 6. A large number of data are used to show trends, relationships, or differences among variables and is one of the weaknesses of quantitative research 7. Descriptive research is the design concerned with describing the nature, characteristics and components of the population or a phenomenon. 8. Reliable quantitative studies cannot be repeated to verify or confirm its correctness in another setting 9. Research allows you to directly make a conclusion without ample data gathered using a problem- solving technique. 10. Inquiry is closely linked with research because investigating or examining a phenomenon is how research is started.​</h2><br />

Reliable quantitative studies CANNOT be repeated to verify or confirm itscorrectness in another setting.4. Inquiry is closely linked with research because investigating or examining aphenomenon is how research is started.5. Quantitative research is NOT a scientific, experimental, or inductive mannerof thinking6. Research allows you to directly make a conclusion without ample datagathered using a problem-solving technique.7. Qualitative research uses structured research instruments like questionnairesto collect measurable characteristics of the respondents.8. Descriptive research is the design concerned with describing the nature,characteristics and components of the population or a phenomenon.9. Experimental Research is the systematic investigation of the nature ofrelationships, or associations between and among variables without necessarilyinvestigating into causal reasons underlying them10. A survey research is used to gather information from groups of people byselecting and studying samples chosen from a population.​</h2><br />
