                                            ENGLISH MELC 21: Give expanded definitions of words. Writing a Good Expanded Definition Expanded Definitions of Words Definition, one of the most useful forms of writing, helps readers arrive at a basic understanding of concepts or ideas in essays or reports. In your writing, you may be using technical word that some people may be unfamiliar with like liabilities in business or more abstract concept like happiness a word that different people have personal feelings or meanings attached to it. Thus, this calls for a certain term to be explained not by merely providing synonyms or listing examples but with much details or the use of expanded/extended definition. To illustrate further, when you write reports; you may often discover that you need to explain certain basics before you can discuss the main subject matter. A good example is in a write-up on the benefits of drip irrigation, you would need first to write an extended definition of drip irrigation, differentiating its sub- types, explaining how it works, and what equipment is used. This lesson will inform you about expanded definitions of words, which is commonly used in formal papers or academic essays to ensure that misunderstanding or miscommunication will not happen. This is because words often have more than one meaning, so we write expanded definitions to make sure that our readers share our meaning or concept of the word we are using. This lesson will also introduce you to the different techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions. Concept Digest Expanded definition goes deeper than a simple dictionary definition, offering an expanded analysis and illustration of a concept that might be abstract, debatable, controversial, unfamiliar, or frequently misunderstood. Giving an expanded definition is 1 distinguishing the characteristics of a certain word, 2 providing extra facts or information about it, 3 giving examples, and 4 saying what cannot be included to describe it. Formal Definition ng maile others iso Sense of humor is the ability to laugh and make others laugh ↓ A formal definition consists of three parts: the term being defined, the class it belongs to, and its distinguishing characteristics. An informal definition explains an unfamiliar term using synonyms or antonyms introduced by or, in other words, or ike. Take note of how the term sense of humor was defined. Term Class Distinguishing Characteristics Sense of Humor Informal Definition Sense of humor means to appreciate a joke or to perce ve humor ↓ Since expanding basic formal definitions means explaining the differentiating characteristics thoroughly, the following questions may serve as framework: Synonyms What does it do? How is it used? - How does it work? What are its parts? Can it be compared to anything familiar? What is its origin and background? UN techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions listed below may be of great help in answering the aforementioned questions. Be aware, however, that the technique/s to be used will depend on what is appropriate for the term you are trying to define or explain. ​</a>

I adopted this habit and ever since I have been doing the same.</p><p></p><p>My maternal grandparents have been my true systems of support. I am lucky enough to have grown up around such inspirational people. My grandfather was a principal of a college, so he always emphasized the importance of education.

I spent my vacations at their place as I enjoyed living with them.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, my grandparents always embraced me with open arms. They used to wait for every holiday for our arrival. My grandmother made delicious pickles and meals which we relished greatly. She taught me a few recipes too and tips and tricks that are very useful even today. I simply adore my grandparents for instilling good values in me and my parents and for giving us a safe space to grow up in.</p><br />

                            26. ENGLISH MELC 21: Give expanded definitions of words. Writing a Good Expanded Definition Expanded Definitions of Words Definition, one of the most useful forms of writing, helps readers arrive at a basic understanding of concepts or ideas in essays or reports. In your writing, you may be using technical word that some people may be unfamiliar with like liabilities in business or more abstract concept like happiness a word that different people have personal feelings or meanings attached to it. Thus, this calls for a certain term to be explained not by merely providing synonyms or listing examples but with much details or the use of expanded/extended definition. To illustrate further, when you write reports; you may often discover that you need to explain certain basics before you can discuss the main subject matter. A good example is in a write-up on the benefits of drip irrigation, you would need first to write an extended definition of drip irrigation, differentiating its sub- types, explaining how it works, and what equipment is used. This lesson will inform you about expanded definitions of words, which is commonly used in formal papers or academic essays to ensure that misunderstanding or miscommunication will not happen. This is because words often have more than one meaning, so we write expanded definitions to make sure that our readers share our meaning or concept of the word we are using. This lesson will also introduce you to the different techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions. Concept Digest Expanded definition goes deeper than a simple dictionary definition, offering an expanded analysis and illustration of a concept that might be abstract, debatable, controversial, unfamiliar, or frequently misunderstood. Giving an expanded definition is 1 distinguishing the characteristics of a certain word, 2 providing extra facts or information about it, 3 giving examples, and 4 saying what cannot be included to describe it. Formal Definition ng maile others iso Sense of humor is the ability to laugh and make others laugh ↓ A formal definition consists of three parts: the term being defined, the class it belongs to, and its distinguishing characteristics. An informal definition explains an unfamiliar term using synonyms or antonyms introduced by or, in other words, or ike. Take note of how the term sense of humor was defined. Term Class Distinguishing Characteristics Sense of Humor Informal Definition Sense of humor means to appreciate a joke or to perce ve humor ↓ Since expanding basic formal definitions means explaining the differentiating characteristics thoroughly, the following questions may serve as framework: Synonyms What does it do? How is it used? - How does it work? What are its parts? Can it be compared to anything familiar? What is its origin and background? UN techniques/approaches to making expanded definitions listed below may be of great help in answering the aforementioned questions. Be aware, however, that the technique/s to be used will depend on what is appropriate for the term you are trying to define or explain. ​</h2><br />
