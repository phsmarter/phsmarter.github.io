                                            A poorly dressed lady with a look of defeat on her face, walked into a grocery store. She approached the owner of the store in the humblest manner and asked if he would let her charge a few groceries. She softly explained that her husband was very ill and unable to work, they have 7 children and they needed food. The process scoffed at her and requested that she leave his store. Visualizing the family needs, she said, “Please, sir! I will bring you the money just as soon as I can.” The grocer told he could not give her credit, as she did not have a charge account at his store. Standing beside the counter was a customer who overheard the conversation between the two. The customer walked forward and told the grocer that he would stand good for whatever she needed for her family. The grocer said in a very reluctant voice, “Do you have a grocery list?” The lady replied, “Yes, sir.” “Okay,” he said. “Put your grocery list on the scales and whatever your grocery list weighs, I will give you that amount in groceries.” The lady hesitated a moment with a bowed head, then she reached into her purse and took out a piece of paper and scribbled something on it. She then laid the piece of paper on the scale carefully with her head still bowed. The eyes of the grocer and the customer showed amazement when the scales went down and stayed down. The grocers, staring at the scales, turn slowly to the customer and said begrudgingly, “I can’t believe it.” The customer smiled and the grocer started putting the groceries on the other side of the scales. The scale did not balance so he continued to put more and more groceries on them until the scales would hold no more. The grocer stood there in utter disgust. Finally, he grabbed the piece of paper from the scales and looked at it with greater amazement. It was not a grocery list: it was a prayer which said, “Dear Lord, you know my needs and I am leaving this in your hands. The grocer gives her the groceries that he had gathered and stood in stunned silence. It was sometimes later that the grocer discovered the scales were broken; therefore, only God knows how much a prayer weight.

                                            By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of ReadingI have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.I am this kid.Who were the people who helped him pursue his dream in life? 'Where did he live when he was still a kid? Where did he finish his college degree? Where does he presently work?When did the author realize that his family was having financial problems?What particular situations can prove that the boy’s family was really poor?What kind of relationship does the author have with his siblings? Cite the reason behind your conclusion.Why did he not complain after being told by his mother that she couldn’t buy him a new pair of slippers?(The subject is Reading)</a>

I ran into a stranger as he passed by
"Oh excuse me, please" was my reply.
He said, "Please excuse me, too;
I wasn't even watching for you.
We went on our way and we said good-bye.
But at home a different story is told,
How we treat our loved ones, young and old.
Later that day, cooking the evening meal,
My daughter stood beside me very still.
When I turned around, I nearly knocked her down.
"Move out of my way," I said with a frown.
She walked away, her little heart broken.
I didn't realize how harshly I'd spoken.
While I lay awake in bed,
The voice of God came to me and said,
"While dealing with a stranger, common courtesy you use,
But the children you love, you seem to abuse.
Look on the kitchen floor,
You'll find some flowers there by the door,
Those are the flowers she brought for you.
She picked them herself, pink, yellow, and blue.
She stood quietly not to spoil the surprise,
And you never saw the tears in her eyes."
By this time I felt very small,
And now my tears began to fall.
I quietly went and knelt by her bed;
"Wake up little girl, wake up," I said.
"Are these the flowers you picked for me?​
 knew you'd like them, especially the blue."
I said, "Daughter, I am sorry for the way I did today,
I shouldn't have shout at you that way."
She said, "Oh Mommy that's okay
And I do like the flowers, especially the blue."​

                            8. A poorly dressed lady with a look of defeat on her face, walked into a grocery store. She approached the owner of the store in the humblest manner and asked if he would let her charge a few groceries. She softly explained that her husband was very ill and unable to work, they have 7 children and they needed food. The process scoffed at her and requested that she leave his store. Visualizing the family needs, she said, “Please, sir! I will bring you the money just as soon as I can.” The grocer told he could not give her credit, as she did not have a charge account at his store. Standing beside the counter was a customer who overheard the conversation between the two. The customer walked forward and told the grocer that he would stand good for whatever she needed for her family. The grocer said in a very reluctant voice, “Do you have a grocery list?” The lady replied, “Yes, sir.” “Okay,” he said. “Put your grocery list on the scales and whatever your grocery list weighs, I will give you that amount in groceries.” The lady hesitated a moment with a bowed head, then she reached into her purse and took out a piece of paper and scribbled something on it. She then laid the piece of paper on the scale carefully with her head still bowed. The eyes of the grocer and the customer showed amazement when the scales went down and stayed down. The grocers, staring at the scales, turn slowly to the customer and said begrudgingly, “I can’t believe it.” The customer smiled and the grocer started putting the groceries on the other side of the scales. The scale did not balance so he continued to put more and more groceries on them until the scales would hold no more. The grocer stood there in utter disgust. Finally, he grabbed the piece of paper from the scales and looked at it with greater amazement. It was not a grocery list: it was a prayer which said, “Dear Lord, you know my needs and I am leaving this in your hands. The grocer gives her the groceries that he had gathered and stood in stunned silence. It was sometimes later that the grocer discovered the scales were broken; therefore, only God knows how much a prayer weight.

                            9. By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of ReadingI have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.I am this kid.Who were the people who helped him pursue his dream in life? 'Where did he live when he was still a kid? Where did he finish his college degree? Where does he presently work?When did the author realize that his family was having financial problems?What particular situations can prove that the boy’s family was really poor?What kind of relationship does the author have with his siblings? Cite the reason behind your conclusion.Why did he not complain after being told by his mother that she couldn’t buy him a new pair of slippers?(The subject is Reading)</h2><br />

                            10. Author Unknown
I ran into a stranger as he passed by
"Oh excuse me, please" was my reply.
He said, "Please excuse me, too;
I wasn't even watching for you.
We went on our way and we said good-bye.
But at home a different story is told,
How we treat our loved ones, young and old.
Later that day, cooking the evening meal,
My daughter stood beside me very still.
When I turned around, I nearly knocked her down.
"Move out of my way," I said with a frown.
She walked away, her little heart broken.
I didn't realize how harshly I'd spoken.
While I lay awake in bed,
The voice of God came to me and said,
"While dealing with a stranger, common courtesy you use,
But the children you love, you seem to abuse.
Look on the kitchen floor,
You'll find some flowers there by the door,
Those are the flowers she brought for you.
She picked them herself, pink, yellow, and blue.
She stood quietly not to spoil the surprise,
And you never saw the tears in her eyes."
By this time I felt very small,
And now my tears began to fall.
I quietly went and knelt by her bed;
"Wake up little girl, wake up," I said.
"Are these the flowers you picked for me?​
 knew you'd like them, especially the blue."
I said, "Daughter, I am sorry for the way I did today,
I shouldn't have shout at you that way."
She said, "Oh Mommy that's okay
And I do like the flowers, especially the blue."​

                            11. A poorly dressed lady with a look of defeat on her face, walked into a grocery store. She approached the owner of the store in the humblest manner and asked if he would let her charge a few groceries. She softly explained that her husband was very ill and unable to work, they have 7 children and they needed food. The process scoffed at her and requested that she leave his store. Visualizing the family needs, she said, “Please, sir! I will bring you the money just as soon as I can.” The grocer told he could not give her credit, as she did not have a charge account at his store. Standing beside the counter was a customer who overheard the conversation between the two. The customer walked forward and told the grocer that he would stand good for whatever she needed for her family. The grocer said in a very reluctant voice, “Do you have a grocery list?” The lady replied, “Yes, sir.” “Okay,” he said. “Put your grocery list on the scales and whatever your grocery list weighs, I will give you that amount in groceries.” The lady hesitated a moment with a bowed head, then she reached into her purse and took out a piece of paper and scribbled something on it. She then laid the piece of paper on the scale carefully with her head still bowed. The eyes of the grocer and the customer showed amazement when the scales went down and stayed down. The grocers, staring at the scales, turn slowly to the customer and said begrudgingly, “I can’t believe it.” The customer smiled and the grocer started putting the groceries on the other side of the scales. The scale did not balance so he continued to put more and more groceries on them until the scales would hold no more. The grocer stood there in utter disgust. Finally, he grabbed the piece of paper from the scales and looked at it with greater amazement. It was not a grocery list: it was a prayer which said, “Dear Lord, you know my needs and I am leaving this in your hands. The grocer gives her the groceries that he had gathered and stood in stunned silence. It was sometimes later that the grocer discovered the scales were broken; therefore, only God knows how much a prayer weight.
