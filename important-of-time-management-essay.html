What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)
_____14. What is the main idea of this passage?
A. Called the “Pygmalion effect” i.e. expect the best and you'll get it
B. People are likely to live up to a manager's or superior's expectations
C. Effective leaders encourage a high level of performance by expecting the best from their employees
D. Leader who expects the best gets high achievement
Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.
_____15. What is the main idea of this passage?
A. In 1902, Roosevelt went to Mississippi and was the guest of honor at a hunting expedition
B. The name “Teddy Bear” is derived from President Theodore Roosevelt
C. After story got publicity via political cartoons, candy store owner created Teddy's bear
D. The bear was a hit, and everyone wanted one</a>

                                            Why it is important to know and understand by the waiter or server the establishment guidelines in operating ordering system?​essay: Every establishment has a specific protocol for taking orders from the table and giving them to the kitchen and assembly areas. A new server needs to learn this protocol as quickly as possible in order to be an efficient team member. Asking for your order to be a "rush" order is not a good idea, unless there is a really good reason for it. Servers who are always "rush" orders will find themselves placed at the back of the queue, more often than not.Orders can be written on checks, the duplicate of which is given to the kitchen. If handwriting orders, your handwriting must be legible and easy to understand. Always use the appropriate abbreviations; do not make up your own -- the kitchen will not understand them. Keep your original check or ticket as this is your record of the food that you have ordered from the kitchen, and from which the final bill will be prepared. Never throw these away. If a mistake has been made, run a line through the mistake, and, if necessary, have the manager initial it.More and more restaurants are using a Point of Service computer where you will enter the order from your table and it is automatically delivered via the computer to the kitchen.Your biggest job will be the timing of your orders. Make a point of learning how long it takes to prepare any given dish, then put in the order for the one that takes the longest to prepare first. That way, all dinners for a given table should come out at the same time. Nothing is more uncomfortable for your guests than to serve three guests at a table, only to find out that the fourth guest's meal has not yet been started.The next point that requires your attention is to keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Not only is this necessary for food safety, it also helps to preserve the beauty of the prepared food.There is nothing more unappetizing than to have a cold pat of butter melting on the bread and butter plate because it was served hot. It is your job to ensure that the food arrives at the table in the condition in which it was served from the kitchen.yan po sagot ko </a>

                                            Directions: Read and understand the essay. Summarize the key points using the cause-and-effect diagram found below. Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</a>

                        Work can be defined as an activity that involves physical or mental effort to accomplish a task or goal. It may be paid or unpaid, and it could range from manual labor to professional services. Work can be seen as a fundamental aspect of human life, as it enables individuals to achieve their goals and provide for their needs and wants.Valuing one's own work is important because it fosters a sense of self-worth, dignity, and purpose. It allows a person to take pride in their accomplishments and to recognize the effort and time that they have invested in their work. When one values their own work, they are motivated to improve their skills, increase their productivity, and strive for excellence.Developing desirable work habits or values is crucial to achieving success and personal fulfillment. Some of these habits include punctuality, reliability, dedication, initiative, and accountability. Punctuality means showing up on time and respecting other people's time. Reliability involves keeping promises and meeting deadlines. Dedication means being committed to one's work and giving it the necessary time and effort. Initiative involves being proactive and taking the lead when necessary. Accountability involves taking responsibility for one's actions and decisions.Time management refers to the process of planning, organizing, and controlling one's time to achieve maximum productivity and efficiency. It involves prioritizing tasks, setting goals, and allocating time effectively to accomplish them. Effective time management enables individuals to accomplish more in less time and to reduce stress and anxiety caused by a lack of time.Time is a crucial resource that is directly related to productivity. Effective time management allows individuals to prioritize tasks and allocate time efficiently, which results in increased productivity. When time is managed well, individuals can accomplish more in less time and reduce the risk of burnout and stress caused by overwork.Some instances where one can save time and energy at home include creating a cleaning schedule, preparing meals in advance, organizing household items, and automating tasks such as bill payments and laundry.Project-making is important in daily life because it helps individuals to accomplish their goals and achieve their desired outcomes. Projects provide a structured approach to achieving complex tasks and enable individuals to break them down into manageable steps. By completing projects, individuals can gain a sense of achievement and personal satisfaction.Setting objectives before beginning a project is important because it provides a clear direction and purpose for the project. Objectives help individuals to focus their efforts and prioritize their tasks, which reduces the risk of wasted time and resources. Objectives also enable individuals to measure their progress and evaluate their success in achieving their goals.<p></p><p>brainliest pls ^^ ty</p><br />

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)
_____14. What is the main idea of this passage?
A. Called the “Pygmalion effect” i.e. expect the best and you'll get it
B. People are likely to live up to a manager's or superior's expectations

D. Leader who expects the best gets high achievement
Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.

A. In 1902, Roosevelt went to Mississippi and was the guest of honor at a hunting expedition
B. The name “Teddy Bear” is derived from President Theodore Roosevelt
C. After story got publicity via political cartoons, candy store owner created Teddy's bear

A new server needs to learn this protocol as quickly as possible in order to be an efficient team member. Asking for your order to be a "rush" order is not a good idea, unless there is a really good reason for it. Servers who are always "rush" orders will find themselves placed at the back of the queue, more often than not.Orders can be written on checks, the duplicate of which is given to the kitchen. If handwriting orders, your handwriting must be legible and easy to understand. Always use the appropriate abbreviations; do not make up your own -- the kitchen will not understand them. Keep your original check or ticket as this is your record of the food that you have ordered from the kitchen, and from which the final bill will be prepared. Never throw these away. If a mistake has been made, run a line through the mistake, and, if necessary, have the manager initial it.More and more restaurants are using a Point of Service computer where you will enter the order from your table and it is automatically delivered via the computer to the kitchen.Your biggest job will be the timing of your orders. Make a point of learning how long it takes to prepare any given dish, then put in the order for the one that takes the longest to prepare first. That way, all dinners for a given table should come out at the same time. Nothing is more uncomfortable for your guests than to serve three guests at a table, only to find out that the fourth guest's meal has not yet been started.The next point that requires your attention is to keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Not only is this necessary for food safety, it also helps to preserve the beauty of the prepared food.There is nothing more unappetizing than to have a cold pat of butter melting on the bread and butter plate because it was served hot. It is your job to ensure that the food arrives at the table in the condition in which it was served from the kitchen.yan po sagot ko </h2><br />

More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</h2><br />
