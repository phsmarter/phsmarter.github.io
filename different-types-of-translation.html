                    <p>Many different types of mutations can occur within the body. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that is caused by different mutations within the CFTR gene. One mutation in the CFTR gene that leads to cystic fibrosis causes translation to end earlier in the gene sequence. Which type of mutation causes this translation error that leads to cystic fibrosis?</p>

                            1. Many different types of mutations can occur within the body. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that is caused by different mutations within the CFTR gene. One mutation in the CFTR gene that leads to cystic fibrosis causes translation to end earlier in the gene sequence. Which type of mutation causes this translation error that leads to cystic fibrosis?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that is passed down through families. It is caused by a defective gene that makes the body produce abnormally thick and sticky fluid, called mucus.

Answers:</p><p></p><p>Mutations can be caused by various factors such as exposure to radiation, chemicals, viruses, or errors in DNA replication.</p><p></p><p>The two types of gene mutations are point mutations and frameshift mutations. Point mutations involve changes in a single nucleotide, while frameshift mutations involve insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides.</p><p></p><p>Frameshift mutations are usually more destructive because they can cause a shift in the reading frame, changing the sequence of amino acids in the resulting protein.</p><p></p><p>Gene mutation involves changes in a single gene, whereas chromosome mutation involves changes in the number or structure of chromosomes.</p><p></p><p>Mutations can have different effects. Some mutations can be neutral, meaning they have no effect on the organism, while others can be harmful or beneficial. Harmful mutations can lead to genetic disorders or diseases, while beneficial mutations can lead to adaptations that improve an organism's chances of survival and reproduction.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Now you will work on activities to assess your understanding on the structure of the DNA, explain how DNA replication takes place, how ribonucleic acid (RNA) is made using the information from DNA, how information in some genes is translated into proteins, and explain how mutations may cause changes in the structure &amp; functions of a protein. Learning Task 1: DNA vs RNA Fill in the comparison table below. Basis of Comparison 1. Number of Strands 2. Location in the cell 3. Type of sugar 4. Nitrogenous base pair DNA RNA​</h2><br />
                        1. Number of Strands: DNA has two strands, while RNA has only one strand.<br />2. Location in the cell: DNA is found in the nucleus of the cell, while RNA is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.<br />3. Type of sugar: DNA contains deoxyribose sugar, while RNA contains ribose sugar.<br />4. Nitrogenous base pair: DNA has four nitrogenous base pairs (adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine), while RNA has four nitrogenous base pairs (adenine, uracil, cytosine, and guanine).<br />Both DNA and RNA are nucleic acids that carry genetic information. DNA serves as the blueprint for the synthesis of RNA, which in turn serves as the template for the synthesis of proteins. During transcription, RNA is made using the information from DNA. During translation, the information in RNA is used to synthesize proteins.<br />Mutations in DNA can cause changes in the structure and function of proteins, which can lead to genetic disorders.<br />
