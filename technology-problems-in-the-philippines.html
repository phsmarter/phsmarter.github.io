The cerebrum is the brain's thinking part, and it controls your voluntary muscles - the ones that move when you want them to. So it would help if you had your cerebrum to dance or kick a soccer ball, solve math problems, figure out a video game, and draw a picture. Your memory lives in the cerebrum. ✓ 3.

Case Study
 Maxwell Prime, a non-sectarian co-educational institution in Metro Manila is one of the top schools of choice in the Philippines. It is an educational institution known for providing quality education and creating an engaging learning environment. The institution has adapted to the environmental changes specifically the development of technology. Technological advancement has been maximized by the institution and used it as a leverage competing with other players in the education industry. Due to this, a lot of students became attracted to the Maxwell Prime which led the institution to record 6000 enrollees — the highest number of enrollees in 2016. This number became the standard of the institution which was consistently met in its years of operation. In the present environment, Maxwell Prime aims to meet the set number of enrollees.
 However, there is a 20% decrease in enrollees due to the pandemic. Potential students became afraid in engaging into a possible face-to-face class and had the need to self-isolate. There are also students that chose not to enroll because of the new learning set-up — Online Classes. All this happened due the public health crisis and have greatly affected the education industry.
 Due to lack of enrollees, Maxwell Prime needs to lay off teachers to keep the institution running. However, when the online class has started, the attrition rate of the employees increases too. Teachers are leaving because of different reasons such as lack of support, adjustment to the online environment, mental health concern, etc. This slowly causes a problem in the operations and productivity of the institution.</a>

Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) can potentially address some of the economic problems faced by the Philippine government, but it is not a panacea that can solve all economic issues.</p><p></p><p>ICTs can contribute to economic growth by increasing productivity, improving efficiency, and reducing costs in various sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and services. For example, the use of e-commerce platforms and digital payment systems can facilitate business transactions and expand market access, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). ICTs can also enhance government services and governance, such as in tax collection, public procurement, and citizen participation.</p><p></p><p>However, the effective use of ICTs requires not only technological infrastructure and connectivity but also human capital, digital skills, and supportive policies and regulations. The digital divide, or the unequal access and use of ICTs across regions and social groups, remains a challenge in the Philippines. Moreover, the country faces other structural constraints to economic development, such as weak institutions, inadequate infrastructure, and low levels of innovation and competitiveness.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, while ICTs can be a valuable tool for economic development, they should be integrated into a comprehensive and inclusive development strategy that addresses the broader socio-economic challenges of the country.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer: yes</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: By allowing businesses to engage customers digitally, resume business operations, and address logistical bottlenecks, technologies can help businesses manage the severe economic impacts of COVID-19.</strong></p><p>report if wrong</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>No, It is known that altering your gene might cause a unpredictable outcome which could be worst than the problem it self. Although gene therapy already exist in the past decades its success rate is very low and the therapy itself is very expensive. Here in the Philippines a normal citizen cannot afford to undergo this therapy, it is safe to say that only rich person could afford this. </p><p></p><p>On alternate universe:</p><p></p><p>Yes, gene therapy is relatively new compare to other therapy. If our country has the capability of developing this kind of therapy in to have better success not us will benefit from this but also the other country. Although as of now gene therapy is very expensive and is foreign to filipino citizen but if Philippines can pursue its own technological development on this field we could offer the therapy on our own country and could be cheaper compared to having the procedure done on other country.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer</strong></p><p><strong><br />1. INTERNET CONNECTION</strong></p><p><strong><br />Explanation</strong></p><p><strong><br />The Internet has changed the way we live. It has improved the way we communicate with people and how we share information. However, the Internet can also cause problems especially when it is not working as advertised or used as a tool for criminal acts. Filipinos are very familiar with such problems. Here are ten examples to start with, some are mundane while some are serious.<br /><br />2. many organisations it is possible to set up formal systems of communication so that problems are reported early on, but inevitably these systems do not always work. Once a problem has been identified, its exact nature needs to be determined: what are the goal and barrier components of the problem? Some of the main elements of the problem can be outlined, and a first attempt at defining the problem should be made. This definition should be clear enough for you to be able to easily explain the nature of the problem to others<br /><br />3. Steps of the technological design process include: identify a problem, research the problem, generate possible solutions, select the best solution, create a model, test the model, refine and retest the model as needed, and communicate the final solution.</strong></p><br />

                        <p> </p><p>1.There are many science-related issues in the Philippines. There is a need for more funding in science and technology. Basic sciences, applied sciences, helpful research, and technology innovation should be emphasized in all levels of education to address present-day national needs. We need to improve our quality of life with modern medical advancements like remote health care, which is not available to most Filipinos nowadays, even if they have the money to afford it. Availability of reliable power sources like solar panels (like Tesla's) or coal plants (like SMIC) would also contribute to the country's advancement; these energy production problems are very much present too! And lastly, there's food insecurity, agricultural studies/innovations come to mind</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

Case Study
 Maxwell Prime, a non-sectarian co-educational institution in Metro Manila is one of the top schools of choice in the Philippines. It is an educational institution known for providing quality education and creating an engaging learning environment. The institution has adapted to the environmental changes specifically the development of technology. Technological advancement has been maximized by the institution and used it as a leverage competing with other players in the education industry. Due to this, a lot of students became attracted to the Maxwell Prime which led the institution to record 6000 enrollees — the highest number of enrollees in 2016. This number became the standard of the institution which was consistently met in its years of operation. In the present environment, Maxwell Prime aims to meet the set number of enrollees.
 However, there is a 20% decrease in enrollees due to the pandemic. Potential students became afraid in engaging into a possible face-to-face class and had the need to self-isolate. There are also students that chose not to enroll because of the new learning set-up — Online Classes. All this happened due the public health crisis and have greatly affected the education industry.
 Due to lack of enrollees, Maxwell Prime needs to lay off teachers to keep the institution running. However, when the online class has started, the attrition rate of the employees increases too. Teachers are leaving because of different reasons such as lack of support, adjustment to the online environment, mental health concern, etc. This slowly causes a problem in the operations and productivity of the institution.</h2><br />

                            24. Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program.

There are valid concerns raised by critics, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, as well as the potential revenue loss of colleges and universities. However, the DepEd is optimistic that these problems will be addressed, and some private educational associations commend the implementation of the K to 12 Program. Therefore, there is evidence both for and against SHS, and it is up to policymakers and stakeholders to carefully weigh these factors when making decisions about education reform.<br />6. The effectiveness of the implementation of SHS in the Philippines is a matter of ongoing debate, and opinions may vary depending on various factors, such as personal experiences, beliefs, and the current state of education in the country. Some people may argue that the additional two years of education provide students with more time to develop their skills and prepare for their future careers. On the other hand, others may argue that it is too long and puts a strain on students and their families, especially those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Based on my knowledge, I cannot make a definitive statement on whether SHS should continue to be implemented or not. However, it is essential to evaluate the implementation of SHS continually, monitor its effects, and address any issues that may arise to ensure that it benefits its stakeholders and achieves its intended goals.</strong></p><br />

                            28. One of the problems the Philippines is facing is the slow adoption of modern technology in agriculture.Many of Filipino farmers are still using traditional farming techniques than employing a more advanced method of cultivating their lands. Technology is inevitable, and most of the countries in the world are already using technology for production and distribution of goods.WHAT IS THE POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO THIS? *​</h2><br />
                        <p> </p><p>AGRICULTURE in the Philippines has always been associated with manual labor and backward traditional farming methods. For the Department of Agriculture (DA), the stigma of farming being a poor man’s job doesn’t make it easier to fulfill its mandate of reaching food security or attracting more people to join the sector. However, progress is already creeping into the sector slowly but surely.</p><p>In the past few years, both the government and the private sector made efforts to address self-sufficiency in important food staples through the introduction of hybrid seeds, innovative farming techniques and technology to the agriculture sector.</p><p>Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel F. Piñol in May unveiled the department’s key strategies that was “designed in such a way that they will not be just answering the needs of the people in six years but beyond 10 years, 20 years and even 50 years.”</p><p>One of these was a revolutionary guide map (www.farmersguidemap.gov.ph) which plots which crops are best grown for each area in the Philippines and where there are shallow water tables. It also indicates fertilizers needed to make up for the nutrients lacking in the area’s soil and the poverty incidence of the community selected</p><p></p><p>Yan po</p><p> </p><p></p><br />

What are the science-related issues and problems in the Philippines?3.How do new information technologies change the science education process?​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. The current trends in Science Education in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results show that there is an increased emphasis on inquiry-based learning, which involves students actively engaging in scientific investigations and problem-solving. There is also a growing focus on the integration of technology in science education, including the use of simulations, virtual labs, and other digital resources.</p><p></p><p>2. Some of the science-related issues and problems in the Philippines include a lack of resources and funding for science education, limited access to quality science teachers and materials, and a lack of interest among students in pursuing careers in science and technology fields.</p><p></p><p>3. New information technologies are changing the science education process by providing new opportunities for students to engage with scientific concepts and data. For example, virtual labs and simulations allow students to conduct experiments and explore scientific phenomena in a safe and controlled environment. Online resources and digital tools also provide access to a wealth of scientific information and data, which can be used to support inquiry-based learning and problem-solving activities. Additionally, new technologies are enabling more collaborative and interactive learning experiences, such as online discussion forums and video conferencing, which can help students connect with peers and experts from around the world.</p><br />

                            30. 1. How does media and information affects education and economy? 2. Why do indigenous people or cultured people need to adopt advanced technologies? 3. What do you think is the problem with regards to the internet speed in the Philippines compare to other southeast Asian nations? 4. How did the media affect the National Election in the Philippines last year? Did it affect our society as well? 5. How did the new media affect our views and culture?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>1. Media and information have significant impacts on education and economy. In terms of education, access to information through media can enhance learning and promote knowledge sharing. On the other hand, the economic impact of media and information lies in its ability to create jobs, provide new markets, and stimulate innovation. The media also plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, which can influence economic policy and decision-making.</p><p> </p><p>2. Indigenous people or cultured people can benefit from advanced technologies by utilizing them to preserve their traditions and cultural practices, and to promote their economic development. For instance, technology can be used to document and share indigenous knowledge, promote eco-tourism, and market their traditional products. Moreover, adopting advanced technologies can help indigenous communities improve their living standards and achieve sustainable development.</p><p></p><p>3. The slow internet speed in the Philippines compared to other Southeast Asian nations is mainly due to inadequate infrastructure and the lack of competition in the telecommunications industry. The Philippines has one of the highest internet costs in the region, and the government needs to address this issue by promoting competition and investing in the necessary infrastructure to improve internet connectivity.</p><p></p><p>4. Media played a significant role in the 2022 Philippine National Election by providing news coverage, political advertising, and social media engagement. It influenced public opinion and voter behavior, which ultimately affected the outcome of the election. However, media coverage was also marred by misinformation, propaganda, and biased reporting, which could have contributed to social division and polarization.</p><p></p><p>5. New media has profoundly impacted our views and culture by providing new ways of communication, sharing information, and entertainment. Social media, for instance, has allowed people to connect and exchange ideas globally, but it has also created new challenges such as fake news, online harassment, and addiction. The new media has also contributed to the blurring of traditional cultural boundaries and the emergence of new forms of expression and creativity.</p><br />
