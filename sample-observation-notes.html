                                            Procedure: A. Preparation of onion acid base indicator (WITH ADULT SUPERVISION) 1. Chop the onion Into small slices. 2. Boil 1/2 cup distilled water and the pour It to a container 3. Put the sliced onion in Water and let the water cool down. 4. After the water cools down, the color of water should change. 5. Strain it to remove the solid portion. B. Determining the acidity or basicity of some common household items 1. Place one (1) teaspoon of each sample in each well of the egg tray or plastic cup (calamansi juice, vinegar, soft drinks, distilled water, soap, detergent powder and baking soda). Note: If the sample is solid, wet a pinch (size of 2-3 match heads) of the solid with about 1/2 teaspoon of distilled water. 2. Add 8-10 drops (or 1/2 teaspoon) of the onion indicator to each sample. 3. Note the color produced. Record your observations in column 2 of the table. 4. Determine the acidic or basic nature of your sample using the color scheme below ACIDIC BASIC RED GREEN SAMPLE Calamansi Juice Vinegar Softdrinks Distilled water Soap Baking soda Detergent powder COLOR OF INDICATOR NATURE OF SAMPLEthank you for answer (Sana po yung maayos:)​</a>

Read these questions first before you do the activity. And after you do the activity, you can now supply the answer for these questions. 1 After three days of observation, what happened to the iron nails with a drop of vinegar on it? How about the other sample? 2. Compare the two samples (with vinegar and none) is there a difference after your three days observation? 3. What do you think is the content of vinegar why it changes the iron nail? 4 Based from the result of your activity and observation, what practical application/ s it implies?​</a>

2. Label each sample with A, B and C.
3. Scoop at least two tablespoons of soil from each sample
4. Place each sample on a separate bond paper.
5. Look closer to each sample and use the popsicle sticks to observe each.

Usually, when you add energy to a bunch of atoms they move faster and get hotter. ... For instance, when water is boiling, adding heat does not increase its temperature. This happens at the boiling temperature of every substance that can vaporize.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Directions: follow the given instruction, observe and note the reactions. BE CAREFUL IN DOING THE EXPERIMENT.
Materials: vinegar, water, baking soda, glass
Procedure:
1. Dilute vinegar in water to get three different concentrations,
2.The ratio of water to vinegar may be 0:1 (pure vinegar), 1:1, and 2:1
3.Pour the vinegar samples into 1 tbsp. of baking soda
4. Note the difference in reactions,

The mixture quickly foams up with carbon dioxide gas. If enough vinegar is used, all of the baking soda can be made to react and disappear into the vinegar solution.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>The physical changes</strong></p><p>The solid baking soda was placed in liquid vinegar producing carbon dioxide gas, which is evident because of the formation of bubbles in the foaming mixture. Eventually all of the solid dissolved and reacted producing a new liquid solution.</p><p></p><p>During the reaction, a solid and liquid have been chemically reacted to form a gas and a liquid. This experiment can also be used to explain foams, as liquids or solids containing gas bubbles.</p><p></p><p><strong>Safety and disposal</strong></p><p>Although both reactants are household chemicals and foodstuffs, caution should be taken not to get splashes in the eyes and clothes should be protected. The products of the reaction are relatively safe (Remember - no chemicals should be touched) and can be disposed of by washing down the sink with plenty of water</p><p></p><br />

                            23. Procedure: A. Preparation of onion acid base indicator (WITH ADULT SUPERVISION) 1. Chop the onion Into small slices. 2. Boil 1/2 cup distilled water and the pour It to a container 3. Put the sliced onion in Water and let the water cool down. 4. After the water cools down, the color of water should change. 5. Strain it to remove the solid portion. B. Determining the acidity or basicity of some common household items 1. Place one (1) teaspoon of each sample in each well of the egg tray or plastic cup (calamansi juice, vinegar, soft drinks, distilled water, soap, detergent powder and baking soda). Note: If the sample is solid, wet a pinch (size of 2-3 match heads) of the solid with about 1/2 teaspoon of distilled water. 2. Add 8-10 drops (or 1/2 teaspoon) of the onion indicator to each sample. 3. Note the color produced. Record your observations in column 2 of the table. 4.

Read these questions first before you do the activity. And after you do the activity, you can now supply the answer for these questions. 1 After three days of observation, what happened to the iron nails with a drop of vinegar on it? How about the other sample? 2. Compare the two samples (with vinegar and none) is there a difference after your three days observation? 3. What do you think is the content of vinegar why it changes the iron nail? 4 Based from the result of your activity and observation, what practical application/ s it implies?​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Sarimanok (Pronunciation: sá·ri·ma·nók), also known as papanok in its feminine form,[1] is a legendary bird of the Maranao people, who originate from Mindanao, an island in the Philippines, and part of Philippine mythology. It comes from the words sari and manok. Sari means "assorted" or "various", while manok originally meant "bird" as evidenced by early Spanish colonial sources, but came to mean only "chicken", which is how it is understood today (i.e. the creature is a "bird/chicken of assorted colors")</p><p></p><p>The Sarimanok is a legendary bird of the Maranao people who originate from Mindanao, a major island in the Philippines. It comes from the words “sari” and “manok.” “Sari” means cloth or garment, which is generally of assorted colors. Manòk, which makes up part of its name, is a Philippine word for chicken.The Sarimanok is derived from a totem bird of the Maranao people, called Itotoro. According to the Maranao people, the Itotoro is a medium to the spirit world via its unseen twin spirit bird called Inikadowa.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
