My Friend
Your eyes filled with emotion your smile sparkles like newly fallen snow I only wish that I knew how to let my true feelings for your show. Beneath your tough appearance lies a heart of solid gold
I don’t want to give up our friendship no matter what I’ve been told.
Your kind soul and tender spirit can brighten anyone’s lousy day
your gentle touch and soothing voice make all my fears just melt away.
