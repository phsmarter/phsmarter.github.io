We have a garden and we have some flowers there. In weekdays I arrive home at five o'clock and I have lunch. Then I do my homework and go to bed. I had a computer but now it doesn't work. I have a brother and a sister and I think I am very lucky to live with them. Sometimes our relatives visit us. Our flat becomes very crowded sometimes but I like it. -http://www.buowl.boun.edu.tr/students/Paragraph%20Writing%20Exercises.htm Answer: ____________________ 2. It is commonly recognized that dogs have an extreme antagonism toward cats. This enmity between these two species can be traced back to the time of the early Egyptian dynasties. Archaeologists in recent years have discovered Egyptian texts in which there are detailed accounts of canines brutally mauling felines. Today this type of cruelty between these two domestic pets can be witnessed in regions as close as your own neighborhood. For example, when dogs are walked by their masters (and they happen to catch sight of a stray cat), they will pull with all their strength on their leash until the master is forced to yield; the typical result is that a feline is chased up a tree. The hatred between dogs and cats has lasted for many centuries, so it is unlikely that this conflict will ever end. -https://www.wheaton.edu/academics/services/writing-center/writing-resources/paragraph-unity-coherence-and-development/ Answer: ____________________ 3.

Properties of a well-written text not applied in the paragraph:</p><p>The paragraph lacks coherence, as the information provided seems disconnected and does not flow logically. There is no clear structure or organization.</p><p>The paragraph lacks detail and descriptive language. The author provides very little information about the house, its surroundings, or the garden.</p><p>The paragraph does not engage the reader or create a sense of interest or intrigue. The language is straightforward and lacks any creative or literary elements.</p><p>Why these properties are not applied in the paragraph:</p><p>It is possible that the paragraph was written for a specific purpose or audience, where these properties were not necessary or important. For example, if the paragraph was written as part of a factual report or survey, the focus may be on providing specific details and information rather than creating an engaging or creative piece of writing.

It is commonly recognized that dogs have an extreme antagonism toward cats. This enmity between these two species can be traced back to the time of the early Egyptian dynasties. Archaeologists in recent years have discovered Egyptian texts in which there are detailed accounts of canines brutally mauling felines. Today this type of cruelty between these two domestic pets can be witnessed in regions as close as your own neighborhood. For example, when dogs are walked by their masters (and they happen to catch sight of a stray cat), they will pull with all their strength on their leash until the master is forced to yield; the typical result is that a feline is chased up a tree. The hatred between dogs and cats has lasted for many centuries, so it is unlikely that this conflict will ever end. -https://www.wheaton.edu/academics/services/writing-center/writing-resources/paragraph-unity-coherence-and-development/ Answer: ____________________ 3.

They place high regard and put importance on their family before anything else. They work all day and do all they can to feed and provide for their family. In other countries, when a person turned 18, he/she can live away from his/her family. So i must say Filipino families have strong family ties</p><p>2.

It is my experience that rich people are generally unhappier compared to poor people, although richer people have more comfort and security at their disposal. But the rich are still insecure and they want to become richer or they compare themselves with others who are still richer. They usually live an artificial life bereft of simplicity. Pleasures of life make then unhealthy both mentally and physically and they cannot enjoy life as they should</p><p>4. In my opinion, Filipinos are a very hospitable and friendly people. They always smile no matter how they feel.
