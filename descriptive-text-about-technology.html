While waiting for the shower to water to warm up, catch the cold water in the jug or pail. You can use it later to water the plants, fill the kettle, or mop the floor. Turning off the tap while soaping or shampooing will save you about nine liters. a. Sequence b. description c.cause and effect d. comparison and contrast e. problem and solution​</a>

                                            For this assignment, students must watch Episode # 7 from Season 17 of CBC’s “Dragons Den”. Dragons Den is a popular Canadian TV show, where Canadian entrepreneurs present their startup business plans and ask for funding from successful Canadian businesspeople. After watching the episode, students must answer a series of questions (found below) about one of the five segments (stories) in the episode that relate to topics presented in Chapter 5 of the textbook, “Entrepreneurship”. 
QUESTIONS:
1.	How did the entrepreneur(s) from your segment come up with the idea for his/her/their product? If he or she (or they) does not mention how they came up with the idea then tell me this in your answer (write “This information is not provided”) BUT I do want you to tell me how you think they came up with this idea, using all the information given in the segment.
2.	Using the information provided in the segment, describe, in all the detail provided, the offering (so a description of the product, its price, where it is sold and how it is promoted at the time of the airing of the show) that is being pitched (presented) by the entrepreneur(s) to the Dragons. 
3.	Did the Dragons like the product/business idea/entrepreneur? Tell me what each of the Dragons (you must name each of the Dragons in your answer) had to say about the offering/entrepreneur and proposal. Include all details provided in the segment 
4.	Using the information in the segment, identify the external business environment that, in your opinion, has contributed most to the success of the business to date? Explain your answer, and categorize this opportunity using the categories presented in our text (Chapter 1: economic, competitive, social, demographic, political and legal, global, technological, etc.)

                                            For learners to acquire language, meaningful communicative opportunities fornegotiation and interaction are needed (Beckett, 1999; Swain, 1995; Kern&amp; Warschauer, 2000). Likewise, the integration of instructional materials (IMs)augments the stimulation of ideas for classroom activities (Cunnigsworth, 1995;Dudley-Evans &amp; St.John, 1998). Hence, this paper aimed to reboot the ESLClassroom via technology-based instructional materials (TBIMs). Specifically, itsought answers to the following objectives: (1) identify the TBIMs in ESL classrooms;(2) determine the problems encountered on TBIMs; (3) present the implications ofTBIMs; and (4) propose augmentation on TBIMs. The descriptive type of research andthe stratified random sampling technique were employed. Respondents were drawnfrom the senior high school students of Grade 11 enrolled in English for Academicand Professional Purposes (EAPP) during first semester of school year 2017-2018,and five (5) English Language Teachers at San Francisco B National High School,Lopez, Quezon. The collection of data was accomplished through: (1) administrationof a modified questionnaire on TBIMs and (2) conduct of a follow-up interview on theencountered problems and implications of TBIMs. The findings revealed thatrespondents have an unenthusiastic perception on the feasibility/effectiveness ofTBIMs to supplement the teaching and learning of the language. Nevertheless, thefindings showed more affirmative viewpoints that TBIMs had somehow increasedtheir level of interest in English and boot up the ESL classroom as well. Even thoughTBIMs remained insufficient and usually unavailable, the researcher still consideredthe returns of being equipped with knowledge and gadgets. But still, in order toemploy TBIMs in supplementing the English language teaching and learning,auxiliary and in-depth discussions and scrutiny about the applicability of TBIMshave to be made. A very short course or workshop (technology-based teaching andlearning camp) is suggested to ESL teachers in order to help them increaseknowledge in TBIMs and to create a link between the virtual world and the real worldamong the students.1.what issue or concept is presented in the text​</a>

                            6. For this assignment, students must watch Episode # 7 from Season 17 of CBC’s “Dragons Den”. Dragons Den is a popular Canadian TV show, where Canadian entrepreneurs present their startup business plans and ask for funding from successful Canadian businesspeople. After watching the episode, students must answer a series of questions (found below) about one of the five segments (stories) in the episode that relate to topics presented in Chapter 5 of the textbook, “Entrepreneurship”. 
QUESTIONS:
1.	How did the entrepreneur(s) from your segment come up with the idea for his/her/their product? If he or she (or they) does not mention how they came up with the idea then tell me this in your answer (write “This information is not provided”) BUT I do want you to tell me how you think they came up with this idea, using all the information given in the segment.
2.	Using the information provided in the segment, describe, in all the detail provided, the offering (so a description of the product, its price, where it is sold and how it is promoted at the time of the airing of the show) that is being pitched (presented) by the entrepreneur(s) to the Dragons. 
3.	Did the Dragons like the product/business idea/entrepreneur? Tell me what each of the Dragons (you must name each of the Dragons in your answer) had to say about the offering/entrepreneur and proposal. Include all details provided in the segment 
4.	Using the information in the segment, identify the external business environment that, in your opinion, has contributed most to the success of the business to date? Explain your answer, and categorize this opportunity using the categories presented in our text (Chapter 1: economic, competitive, social, demographic, political and legal, global, technological, etc.)
5.	What do the Dragons want to know from the entrepreneur(s) before they will invest in this business? Again, provide the details! Identify at least two questions that the Dragons asked and provide the entrepreneur’(s) answers to those two specific questions.
6.	What else does the entrepreneur(s) want from the Dragons in addition to money? 
7.	What deal does the entrepreneur propose at the beginning of the show? Make sure you identify the type of financing using all the correct terminology from the textbook (Chapter 8), and support your answer with evidence from the segment. 
8.	If you could make one suggestion to the entrepreneur that you think would really help their business, what would it be? 
Cite the segment using MLA citation and any other resources you have used to complete the assignment. </h2><br />
                        Answer<br />Segment: “Barebottom Shoes”<br /><br />1. The entrepreneur, Alyssa Bertram, came up with the idea for Barebottom Shoes after experiencing discomfort and pain from wearing high heels for extended periods of time. She noticed a gap in the market for stylish and comfortable flat shoes that could be worn for both formal and casual events.<br /><br />2. Barebottom Shoes are a line of fashionable and comfortable flat shoes that are sold online and in select retail stores. The shoes are made with high-quality materials and feature a unique cushioning technology for added comfort. At the time of airing, the shoes were priced at $165 per pair and were being promoted through social media and influencer marketing.<br /><br />3. The Dragons were impressed with Bertram's business and product idea. All Dragons, with the exception of one, offered investment deals. Manjit Minhas offered $250,000 for a 25% stake, Arlene Dickinson offered $300,000 for a 20% stake, Jim Treliving offered $250,000 for a 20% stake, and Michele Romanow offered $250,000 for a 22.5% stake. However, Joe Mimran did not make an offer as he believed the business had not yet reached its full potential.<br /><br />4. The external business environment that has contributed most to the success of Barebottom Shoes is the social environment. There is a growing trend towards comfortable and practical footwear among women, especially as more people are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend is reflected in the increasing demand for athleisure and casual wear.<br /><br />5. The Dragons wanted to know more about Bertram's marketing and sales strategy, as well as the scalability of the business. Two specific questions asked were: "How do you plan on scaling this business?" and "What are your sales numbers to date?" Bertram's answers included plans to increase production and expand her online presence, and sales numbers of over $200,000 in the previous year.<br /><br />6. In addition to money, Bertram also wanted mentorship and guidance from the Dragons to help grow her business.<br /><br />7. Bertram proposed a $250,000 investment in exchange for a 15% equity stake in her business. This is an example of equity financing, where investors provide funds in exchange for partial ownership of the company.<br /><br />8. One suggestion for Bertram would be to explore the potential of expanding her product line to include other types of comfortable footwear, such as sandals or boots.<br /><br />MLA citation:<br />CBC. “Barebottom Shoes: A Flat for Every Occasion.” Dragons' Den, season 17, episode 7, CBC Television, 14 Nov. 2019.<br /><br />Textbook reference:<br />Kuratko, D.

                            8. For learners to acquire language, meaningful communicative opportunities fornegotiation and interaction are needed (Beckett, 1999; Swain, 1995; Kern&amp; Warschauer, 2000). Likewise, the integration of instructional materials (IMs)augments the stimulation of ideas for classroom activities (Cunnigsworth, 1995;Dudley-Evans &amp; St.John, 1998). Hence, this paper aimed to reboot the ESLClassroom via technology-based instructional materials (TBIMs). Specifically, itsought answers to the following objectives: (1) identify the TBIMs in ESL classrooms;(2) determine the problems encountered on TBIMs; (3) present the implications ofTBIMs; and (4) propose augmentation on TBIMs. The descriptive type of research andthe stratified random sampling technique were employed. Respondents were drawnfrom the senior high school students of Grade 11 enrolled in English for Academicand Professional Purposes (EAPP) during first semester of school year 2017-2018,and five (5) English Language Teachers at San Francisco B National High School,Lopez, Quezon. The collection of data was accomplished through: (1) administrationof a modified questionnaire on TBIMs and (2) conduct of a follow-up interview on theencountered problems and implications of TBIMs. The findings revealed thatrespondents have an unenthusiastic perception on the feasibility/effectiveness ofTBIMs to supplement the teaching and learning of the language. Nevertheless, thefindings showed more affirmative viewpoints that TBIMs had somehow increasedtheir level of interest in English and boot up the ESL classroom as well. Even thoughTBIMs remained insufficient and usually unavailable, the researcher still consideredthe returns of being equipped with knowledge and gadgets. But still, in order toemploy TBIMs in supplementing the English language teaching and learning,auxiliary and in-depth discussions and scrutiny about the applicability of TBIMshave to be made. A very short course or workshop (technology-based teaching andlearning camp) is suggested to ESL teachers in order to help them increaseknowledge in TBIMs and to create a link between the virtual world and the real worldamong the students.1.what issue or concept is presented in the text​</h2><br />
