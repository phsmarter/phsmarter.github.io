                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Managing Senioritis In today’s society, being a senior in high school is tough. This one year we are expected to decide what we are going to do with our lives by picking a career path to follow and going to a college that can teach us how to excel in that career path. We need to be able to dazzle these colleges and employers with not only our knowledge, but with our extracurricular activities, our skills acquired from jobs that we are expected to have, and recommendation letters from people we have made big impacts on in our lives so far. Dealing with all of these things could make you feel “stressed to the max”, or even get to the point where you are diagnosed with senioritis. If you …show more content…Just thinking about what to do after high school can cause a senior’s stress level to sky rocket. It is scary thinking about what we are going to do when our parents aren’t by our sides or can quickly be at our sides by just one phone call. Before we can make it into that next step in our lives, like college, we have to think about what we want to do for a career and if we could make a living in that career path. Soon after that comes applying for colleges that fit the career path we are interested in (or the path that makes us a large amount of money, even though we may not like it). After applying, we need the money to pay for our schooling. We start filling out scholarships, adding all of the wonderful qualities we have acquired over time and the sparkling achievements we have earned throughout our lifetime. Another important part to college and scholarships is making sure you have a high ACT score. The ACT could determine whether you are able to apply for a scholarship that can get you a full ride to college meaning all expenses are paid for or determine if you even make it into a college. It is just one more thing we have to worry about and schedule. On top of all of this planning for the future, we are members or officers of clubs, trying to maintain jobs, completing schoolwork, making time for our families and friends, and trying make everything work out, so we don’t have to sacrifice one<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A person’s social class has a significant impact on their physical health, their ability to receive adequate medical care and nutrition, and their life expectancy. While gender and race play significant roles in explaining healthcare inequality in the United States, socioeconomic status (SES) is the greatest social determinant of an individual’s health outcome. Social determinants of health are the economic and social conditions that influence individual and group differences in health status. Social determinants are environmental, meaning that they are risk factors found in one’s living and working conditions (including the distribution of income, wealth, influence, and power), rather than individual factors (such as behavioral risk factors or genetics). Social determinants can be used to predict one’s risk of contracting a disease or sustaining an injury, and can also indicate how vulnerable one is to the consequences of a disease or injury. Individuals of lower socioeconomic status have lower levels of overall health, less insurance coverage, and less access to adequate healthcare than those of higher SES.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) strand is one of the four strands offered in senior high school under the K-12 program of the Philippines. It is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the various disciplines that fall under the humanities and social sciences, such as history, English, social studies, and philosophy.</p><p></p><p>One of the most notable features of the HUMSS strand is its focus on critical thinking and analysis. Students are encouraged to question and evaluate the information they are presented with, and to form their own opinions and perspectives. This helps to develop their critical thinking skills, which are essential for problem-solving and decision-making.</p><p></p><p>The HUMSS strand also emphasizes the importance of communication skills. Students learn how to effectively express themselves through writing and speaking, which are essential skills for any career in the humanities and social sciences. They also learn how to listen actively and to interpret and analyze different forms of communication, such as literature, film, and media.</p><p></p><p>Another key aspect of the HUMSS strand is its focus on history and culture. Students learn about the different periods and events that have shaped our world, and how they have affected the societies we live in today. They also learn about different cultures and how they have influenced art, literature, and other forms of expression. This helps to promote cultural understanding and appreciation, which is essential for living in a diverse and globalized world.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these core subjects, the HUMSS strand also offers a range of electives that allow students to explore specific areas of interest. For example, students can choose to take classes in literature, drama, and theater, which will provide them with a deeper understanding of these art forms. They can also take classes in philosophy, which will help them to think critically and to explore different perspectives on life and the world.</p><p></p><p>The HUMSS strand also prepares students for a wide range of careers, including teaching, law, politics, and journalism. The skills and knowledge they gain in the strand will also be useful in any career that requires critical thinking, analysis, and communication skills.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the HUMSS strand in senior high school life is an essential and beneficial aspect of the K-12 program of the Philippines. It provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the humanities and social sciences, and helps them to develop critical thinking, communication, and cultural understanding skills. The strand also prepares students for a wide range of careers, and helps to promote a better understanding of our world.</p><br />

School helps us learn the mindset of an adult working in the workforce. Is it fun, No. Do we have to do this? Yes, we were born for a reason. and that reason is to be a better person outside of high school. </p><p>I thought being a senior was easy. No. It's not easy.  not easy or fun. I dealt with anxiety and the feeling of not being right in the head to love a girl. Yeah, I'm a girl but I'm still with my girlfriend because she needs me and I need her and I'm getting off-topic. the point I'm trying to get across is Highschool is just the beginning, so don't give up. I almost dropped out in my Junior year. Now I'm grateful that my friends talked me out of it. I met new people and am now considered one of them. I may be not so perfect but then again, you don't have to be perfect in order to have someone wonderful in your life, when my real dad left me in 2016 I thought my world was ending, little did I know that he doesn't matter anymore. Neither does having 20 to 350 friends to hang out with during school, and neither does having A's in all your classes. </p><p>If you think you're perfect for yourself, then you'll be perfect for other things along the lines.</p><p></p><p>#KeepCalm&amp;BeStrong</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope this helps you out.</p><br />

                            19. in a minimum of 250 words write an essay by answering the following question how do social stratification differences affect your life as a senior high school student​​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p></p><p></p><p>As a senior high school student, the effects of social stratification can be seen in many aspects of my life. Social stratification is the way in which society is divided into different classes or groups based on factors such as wealth, power, and prestige. These differences can have a significant impact on my life as a student, both in terms of opportunities and experiences.</p><p></p><p>One of the ways in which social stratification affects my life is in terms of the educational opportunities that are available to me. Students from different social classes may have access to different schools, programs, and resources, which can impact their academic performance and future opportunities. For example, students from wealthier families may be able to attend private schools with better facilities and more experienced teachers, which can give them an advantage over students from lower-income families. Additionally, students from lower-income families may face more challenges in terms of affording higher education or pursuing certain careers.</p><p></p><p>Another way in which social stratification affects my life is in terms of the social experiences that I have. Students from different social classes may have access to different social networks, clubs, and activities, which can impact their social development and relationships. For example, students from wealthier families may be able to participate in more expensive extracurricular activities or travel experiences, which can give them a wider range of social connections and experiences. On the other hand, students from lower-income families may face more barriers to participating in these activities, which can limit their social experiences and opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Overall, social stratification can have a significant impact on my life as a senior high school student. It can affect the educational opportunities and experiences that are available to me, as well as my social development and relationships. While I cannot control the social class that I am born into, I can strive to overcome these differences and work towards creating a more equal and inclusive society.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a senior high school student, the effects of social stratification can be seen in almost every aspect of my life. For example, differences in the degree of access to resources, such as educational opportunities and healthcare, can have a significant impact on my future. In many cases, the students who attend well-funded schools, come from affluent families, or are part of a privileged social class have a distinct advantage when it comes to educational opportunities and access to resources. These students often have access to more rigorous coursework, better teachers, and more resources than students from lower-income households or those who attend underfunded schools.</p><p></p><p>These resources can have a significant impact on a student’s educational and career prospects. Access to more rigorous coursework and better teachers can lead to higher grades and test scores, which can give a student an advantage when it comes to college admissions. Privileged students may also have access to internships and other resources that can give them a leg-up in the job market. On the other hand, students from lower-income households may have to contend with inadequate resources, lower quality teachers, and fewer educational opportunities, which can limit their prospects for success.</p><p></p><p>In addition to educational opportunities, social stratification can have a direct impact on my life as a senior high school student. For example, students from privileged backgrounds may have access to a larger social network and more social capital, which can give them an advantage when it comes to college admissions, internships, and job prospects. On the other hand, students from lower-income households may have to contend with fewer social connections, making it more difficult to find mentors or make connections with potential employers.</p><p></p><p>Finally, social stratification can also affect my life in terms of my ability to participate in extracurricular activities. Students from privileged backgrounds may have access to more resources, such as money and transportation, which can make it easier to participate in after-school activities, sports teams, and other extracurriculars. On the other hand, students from lower-income households may not have access to these resources, making it more difficult to participate in activities outside of school.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, social stratification can have a profound impact on my life as a senior high school student. The differences in access to resources, educational opportunities, and social capital can have a direct impact on my future prospects, while differences in access to extracurricular activities can affect my ability to make the most of my high school experience</p><br />

This period marks the transition from childhood to adulthood and the beginning of a new chapter in one's life. It is a time when students are expected to take on more responsibilities and make important decisions that will shape their future.</p><p>During this phase, students are exposed to a wider range of subjects and activities. This expands their knowledge and skills, and prepares them for college and the workforce. They are also given more opportunities to discover their interests and passions, and to explore different careers.</p><p>One of the most challenging aspects of senior high school life is the increased workload and academic pressure.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A person’s social class has a significant impact on their physical health, their ability to receive adequate medical care and nutrition, and their life expectancy. While gender and race play significant roles in explaining healthcare inequality in the United States, socioeconomic status (SES) is the greatest social determinant of an individual’s health outcome. Social determinants of health are the economic and social conditions that influence individual and group differences in health status. Social determinants are environmental, meaning that they are risk factors found in one’s living and working conditions (including the distribution of income, wealth, influence, and power), rather than individual factors (such as behavioral risk factors or genetics). Social determinants can be used to predict one’s risk of contracting a disease or sustaining an injury, and can also indicate how vulnerable one is to the consequences of a disease or injury. Individuals of lower socioeconomic status have lower levels of overall health, less insurance coverage, and less access to adequate healthcare than those of higher SES.</p><br />

                        <p>Hello, below are the tips to survive your studies.  I hope this will give you an idea. </p><p></p><p>Studying can be stressful. Many students find it challenging. To survive senior high school, every student should improve their attitude towards learning. Optimism or staying positive in every activity can help a student finish and have a satisfactory outcome. When one is optimistic, he or she can be productive and will develop love and joy towards his or her works. The second attitude that a student should improve is to stay committed. Commitment helps the student focus on what he or she is doing. A student should focus on the goal. Remember and find the meaning and importance of learning and going to school.</p><p> </p><p>A student should also keep in mind that we are not a robot. We have feelings and emotions that we need to be healthy. To have a healthy mind, we must relax, meditate, lessen unimportant activities, and create friends. To survive senior high school a student should also know how to seek help. Moreover, practice improves performance and adds learning.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><br />
