                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Life in the past and life in the present have many differences and similarities. One of the major differences is the advancements in technology and the convenience it brings to our daily lives. In the past, people had to rely on manual labor and simple tools to accomplish tasks, whereas today we have access to advanced machinery and gadgets that make our lives easier and more efficient.</p><p></p><p>Another significant difference is the increase in globalization and connectivity. In the past, people lived in isolated communities and had limited interactions with others outside their immediate surroundings. Today, with the help of the internet and social media, we are able to connect with people all over the world and access a vast array of information and resources.</p><p></p><p>Despite these differences, there are also many similarities between life in the past and present. For instance, both societies value family, community, and hard work. In the past, people relied on their families and communities for support and security, and today we still prioritize these connections and rely on them for support and guidance. Additionally, the importance of hard work and determination has not changed, as both past and present societies value individuals who are dedicated and dedicated to their goals.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while life in the past and present have many differences, there are also many similarities. Both societies value family, community, and hard work, and both have faced challenges and advancements in their respective time periods. However, the advancements in technology and globalization have greatly impacted the way we live and interact with the world around us.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            3. essay comparing and contrasting your past and present life​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Life in the past and life now-comparison.</p><p>Over the last century, there have been many significant changes in the way we live. Obviously, it is hard to compare the life of the ancient people and the life of the people of the twenty first century because so many changes have occurred. However, even the changes that have taken place over the last ten years are amazing.</p><p>To start with, people were not able to travel such long distances in such short period of time. The planes were not that popular then because they used to be a very expensive means of transport. Nowadays, we have become very mobile. We have fast and comfortable cars and more and more people also travel by plane. Moreover, in the past people had to work much harder as they did not have tools which made their work easier. Today, most of the difficult and dangerous work is done by computers and other machines. In the past the conditions of living were not as comfortable as they are now. There were not bathrooms and running water in many houses, besides many people could not afford household appliances like fridge, TV set or vacuum cleaner because they used to be luxurious goods. Another difference between living now and in the past is the fact that nowadays the access to education is much easier. In the past, there were fewer schools and the quality of the education they provided was much poorer. Besides, nowadays it is much easier to find the educational materials that you need thanks to the Internet. Another difference is that in the past there were not that many sources of entertainment. Therefore people used to spend more time with their friends.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>The Pandemic's Impact on My Life: A Realization</strong></p><p></p><p>The past two years of the pandemic have been a rollercoaster of emotions and experiences. I've realized that life is precious and fragile, and it's important to cherish and make the most of every moment. The pandemic has made me appreciate the simple things in life, such as spending time with loved ones, being healthy, and having a roof over my head. I've also come to understand the importance of self-care and taking time for myself, something I previously took for granted.</p><p></p><p>The pandemic has also had a significant impact on my mental and physical health. With lockdowns and social distancing measures in place, I've struggled with loneliness and isolation. On the other hand, I've also learned to adapt to new ways of working and communicating, and I've become more efficient and organized.</p><p></p><p>Despite the challenges, the pandemic has also brought new opportunities for growth and learning. I've taken up new hobbies, learned new skills, and become more creative. I've also come to appreciate the value of online connections, and I've made new friends from all over the world.</p><p></p><p>To summarize, the pandemic has been a time of self-reflection and realization. It has taught me to appreciate the present moment, to take care of myself, and to find new ways to grow and connect. These lessons will stay with me long after the pandemic is over.</p><p></p><p>- Servion</p><br />

What is the meaning of life?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Answer: It has been a month and 2 days since Baguio City declared an Enhanced Community Quarantine as part of the effort to combat the spread of COVID19. Like every other place, each household was assigned a quarantined pass, and we had to follow the assigned market days for our barangay. The kids and adults in the house are going stir crazy, so we try and find ways to occupy ourselves during this crisis.</p><p></p><p></p><p>My anger at the whole situation died down after getting more information from reliable sources like the Department of Health, the World Health Organization, and news outlets. I saw how grave the situation was and realized that I was being selfish.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This anger however was replaced by something else – a sense of foreboding, that the worst was yet to come. Coupled by a fear of the uncertain, and whether we will come out of this crisis anytime soon if at all.</p><p></p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, let me share some of the personal realizations I have about these challenging times that have helped me make it through every single day.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1. Be kind to yourself first. Since I was part of the Connected Women remote team, I was fortunate that work continued despite the lockdown. The major change for me was having the whole family at home with me, especially the kids. My daily schedule during the first week was all over the place, because I was juggling work with preparing meals and childcare and other things brought on by a full house.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I was kicking myself for not being quick enough with my work tasks, and for small things like cooking lunch late or not being able to put my toddler to bed early enough. Before the end of the first week, I realized that I was being too hard on myself. And this realization came after we did a check-in with our People and Operations team. From then on, I started telling myself: This is not business as usual. This is business unusual. It was normal to find oneself staring blankly into space and unable to think about anything else. What was important was to acknowledge this and to find a way to cope.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Regular check-ins on each team member helped me through this phase. Flexible work arrangements that considered your domestic situation (i.e. childcare, homeschooling, food runs, and errands) were also a Godsend. Since I had a better handle on my work schedule, I was able to tackle my domestic commitments better.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>MArk</strong><strong> </strong><strong>me</strong><strong> </strong><strong>as</strong><strong> brainliest</strong><strong> </strong><strong>plss</strong><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The use of active or passive voice is a fundamental distinction in English, and one that causes trouble for many writers – including native English speakers!</p><p></p><p>Growing up in American schools, students are often taught that they should avoid the passive voice because it is “weak.” However, the choice between active and passive is actually quite nuanced.</p><p></p><p>Depending on the ideas you are trying to express and the conventions of the discipline/journal in which you are writing, the passive voice can be an appropriate, sophisticated, and even preferable choice over the active voice. Nevertheless, the active voice is sometimes a far better choice, and you may use both in the same article depending on the context and content of your sentences and the section of your paper you are writing.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The reason these types of assignments are given so often is that anyone can write about their own experience and it doesn't require any outside resources or research. However, even though anyone can tell a story about their life, that does not mean anyone can write a good essay about that experience. As a professor and teacher for 30 years, I've read thousands of essays and can tell you there is a distinct difference from telling a story about yourself and writing an excellent personal experience essay.
