                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Volleyball, game played by two teams, usually of six players on a side, in which the players use their hands to bat a ball back and forth over a high net, trying to make the ball touch the court within the opponents' playing area before it can be returned.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.Call mine, even when it seems obvious. ... </p><p>2.Try to use all three hits. ... </p><p>3.Don't touch the second ball – unless the setter has 4.called for help. ... </p><p>5.Don't set the ball too close to the net. ... </p><p>6.Don't land on or under the net. ... </p><p>7.Don't pass the ball too close to the net. ... </p><p>8.Don't catch the ball during a play.</p><p></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS PO </p><p><strong>PA BRAINLIST</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ANSWER PO</strong><strong> </strong><strong>THANK YOU</strong><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Volleyball is a team game which has six players that play on either side of the net. A set of rules decide the score that each team is able to make against the other team. The game begins with a player from one team throwing the ball using hand or arm over the net so that the opposite team can receive it on their court.</p><p></p><p>The basic rule is to prevent the received ball from hitting the ground so that it can be thrown back to the other team with up to 3 touches from the team. A foul happens if one person from the team touches the ball more than twice (double-hit) while it’s on their side of the net. Also, a team scores a point by throwing the call across the net to the other team’s side such that it hits the ground directly or the player fails to send it back over the net.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>H</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>P</strong><strong>E</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>P</strong><strong>S</strong><strong> </strong><strong>P</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>)</strong></p><br />
