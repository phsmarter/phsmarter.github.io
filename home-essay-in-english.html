Grade 6-English First, bicycles are environment friendly because it does not release smoke that can create air pollution. Second, it reduces the use of fuel specifically gasoline is because it is not powered by any fuel instead it is powered by the riders muscles in order for it to move. Third, it allows people to save money in their fare or fuel especially nowadays that the fare for commuters increases. Fourth, it is a safe vehicle from home to your workplace or other places you may want to go and vice versa, because you don't need to be exposed in many commuters along the way and you can breathe freely, and feel the breeze while riding on the bicycle. Fifth, you can use it for recreational activities especially when you want to explore places you haven't been before. Sixth, it can improve your muscle strength and cardio-vascular condition. Finally, it can be a good exercise specifically when you want to lose weight. To some people, they might argue that bicycles are not the safest ride and are unserviceable specifically in carrying packages and other loads, but when you think of a good idea, like putting a basket, adding racks or panniers to the bicycle you can be amaze about the capability to carry the loads. People would also look wonderful riding the two-wheel vehicle feeling the breeze and it can help save our planet. Discussion Questions: 1. What is the persuasive essay all about? 2.

The feeling is so warm with asweet fragrance. I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, thefeeling I have for my mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. Sheteaches me all that she knows in what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raisingme up to be a mature, sensible and strong-minded girl.She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I wasyoung because she is more of a caretaker for those so-called bad students rather than aprofessional English teacher. However, she changed my mind with her great passion for herteaching career. Students in her school usually skip classes, spend long period of time in theInternet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I cannot imagine how my mom dealswith them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of around 40 students like this.Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her Mother Fan, which Ienvy.They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One studenteven called my mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at thebeginning because those students are known to have poor teacher-student relationships. Then,I asked one of them. She told me that my mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushesstudents and she always give them useful life suggestions. It was then that I started to beproud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember havingnightmares at a very young age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, andhold me tight until I sleep safe and sound again. When I was a schoolgirl, she kept a closecontact with my teachers. When I had troubles with studies, she never blamed me but gaveme faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful cook. She takes care ofme with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day.'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world, just as the old song goes. My mom isthe dearest person and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.Answer the following questions. 1.what did the writer compare her mother with?2.write at least three sentences that described the mother based on the essay.3.Based on the given example,what is descriptive essay?

TOPIC: WHY FILIPINOS NEED TO STAY AT HOME UNTIL DECEMBER (OR EVEN LONGER) Think of your favorite zombie movie or video game. How do people survive in those fictional situations? They avoid contact with the infected usually by quarantining themselves. That's exactly what isolation does in our present situation. Some people think this is all an overreaction. We've seen plenty of comments on Android Authority articles from readers who think that there's no reason for self-isolation during this pandemic. We've even seen people call this whole thing a hoax. I think we need to stay at home until December (or even longer) because COVID-19 spreads very easily, asymptomatic persons do exist, and there is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19 yet.

                                            Causes and Effects of Energy Crisis What are the causes and effects of the energy crisis? Some of the causes are increased use of energy, waste of energy, growing population, and the shortage of the common fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. There is an increased use of energy because of more electrical appliances used in homes. The need for more appliances also creates a need for more electrical energy to make these appliances. Another reason for the increased use of energy is the need for more transportation. There is a waste of energy because people are careless and leave their lights and appliances on. There are, today, also more instanton appliances for the convenience of users. The growing population creates a demand for more energy as more people use lights and other things that require fuel. The most common fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas are used up rapidly and cannot be replaced immediately for it takes time to build these fuels. As a result of the energy crisis, there are power shortages and increase of prices ENGAGEMENT Activity 2.

                                            My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

Fausto I strongly believed that due to COVID- 19 Pandemic more people nowadays prefer to use bicycles to get from one place to another and it became the safest ride vehicle. Grade 6-English First, bicycles are environment friendly because it does not release smoke that can create air pollution. Second, it reduces the use of fuel specifically gasoline is because it is not powered by any fuel instead it is powered by the riders muscles in order for it to move. Third, it allows people to save money in their fare or fuel especially nowadays that the fare for commuters increases. Fourth, it is a safe vehicle from home to your workplace or other places you may want to go and vice versa, because you don't need to be exposed in many commuters along the way and you can breathe freely, and feel the breeze while riding on the bicycle.

I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, thefeeling I have for my mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. Sheteaches me all that she knows in what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raisingme up to be a mature, sensible and strong-minded girl.She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I wasyoung because she is more of a caretaker for those so-called bad students rather than aprofessional English teacher. However, she changed my mind with her great passion for herteaching career. Students in her school usually skip classes, spend long period of time in theInternet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I cannot imagine how my mom dealswith them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of around 40 students like this.Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her Mother Fan, which Ienvy.They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One studenteven called my mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at thebeginning because those students are known to have poor teacher-student relationships. Then,I asked one of them. She told me that my mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushesstudents and she always give them useful life suggestions. It was then that I started to beproud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember havingnightmares at a very young age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, andhold me tight until I sleep safe and sound again. When I was a schoolgirl, she kept a closecontact with my teachers. When I had troubles with studies, she never blamed me but gaveme faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful cook. She takes care ofme with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day.'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world, just as the old song goes. My mom isthe dearest person and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.Answer the following questions. 1.what did the writer compare her mother with?2.write at least three sentences that described the mother based on the essay.3.Based on the given example,what is descriptive essay?

How do people survive in those fictional situations? They avoid contact with the infected usually by quarantining themselves. That's exactly what isolation does in our present situation. Some people think this is all an overreaction. We've seen plenty of comments on Android Authority articles from readers who think that there's no reason for self-isolation during this pandemic. We've even seen people call this whole thing a hoax. I think we need to stay at home until December (or even longer) because COVID-19 spreads very easily, asymptomatic persons do exist, and there is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19 yet. What will the first body paragraph be about? What will the second body paragraph be about? What will the third body paragraph be about? What will be the concluding paragraph? 4 | ENGLISH 10 FOURTH QUARTER WEEK 7​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>First body paragraph: The first body paragraph will likely provide evidence and arguments supporting the statement that COVID-19 spreads very easily. It may discuss the high transmission rate of the virus, the importance of social distancing measures, and examples of how the virus has spread rapidly in different regions.</p><p></p><p>Second body paragraph: The second body paragraph will focus on the existence of asymptomatic individuals and their role in the spread of COVID-19. It may discuss studies and cases that have demonstrated how asymptomatic carriers can unknowingly transmit the virus to others, emphasizing the need for caution and preventive measures even in the absence of apparent symptoms.</p><p></p><p>Third body paragraph: The third body paragraph will address the absence of a cure or vaccine for COVID-19. It may discuss the challenges in developing a vaccine, the importance of mitigating the spread through isolation and preventive measures until a cure or effective vaccine becomes available, and the potential consequences of lifting restrictions prematurely.</p><p></p><p>Concluding paragraph: The concluding paragraph will summarize the main points discussed in the body paragraphs, reiterating the importance of staying at home until December (or longer). It may emphasize the need for collective responsibility and solidarity in combating the pandemic, urging readers to prioritize public health and safety over personal conveniences. The conclusion may also provide a call to action, encouraging readers to stay informed, follow guidelines, and contribute to the collective effort of controlling the spread of COVID-19.</p><br />

Even in English, reading Death of a Naturalist Seamus Heaney, I found myself thinking up an experiment to do with dragonflies and fireflies. I have a fish tank at home with three different sorts of fish. I've noticed that they all respond differently when I feed them. I'm wondering what else is different in their behavior so, in this extended essay, I'm going to find out how they react to light. 3.

At breakfast my dad likes to listen to Apo Hiking Society, while my little brother has rock songs on his phone and will head bang his way through the dining area. My essay is trying to research why people rely on certain types of music to influence their mood and how music is used in this way for advertising.

                            19. Causes and Effects of Energy Crisis What are the causes and effects of the energy crisis? Some of the causes are increased use of energy, waste of energy, growing population, and the shortage of the common fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. There is an increased use of energy because of more electrical appliances used in homes. The need for more appliances also creates a need for more electrical energy to make these appliances. Another reason for the increased use of energy is the need for more transportation. There is a waste of energy because people are careless and leave their lights and appliances on. There are, today, also more instanton appliances for the convenience of users. The growing population creates a demand for more energy as more people use lights and other things that require fuel. The most common fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas are used up rapidly and cannot be replaced immediately for it takes time to build these fuels. As a result of the energy crisis, there are power shortages and increase of prices ENGAGEMENT Activity 2.

                            23. My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.
