                                            I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4. What did the writer mean by putting words into action based on the poems and essays written by our national heroes in the past? 5-6. How can you prove your love for your country in times of war?

                                            My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                                            Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                                            liwanagin ang Coming to an Awareness of Language By Malcolm X (An Excerpt) In the early years of my life, my mother taught me how to write. Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1. What is the text all about? 2. What message does the author seem to suggest about literacy and education?​</a>

                                            Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time
Essay Topic: Learning at Home during Lockdown: My

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</a>

                            5. I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4. What did the writer mean by putting words into action based on the poems and essays written by our national heroes in the past? 5-6. How can you prove your love for your country in times of war? In times of peace? 7-10. Make believe that you are one of the following: (a. teacher b. policeman c. doctor d. businessman) How can you show that you are a true Filipino in terms of solving community and national problems? ​</h2><br />

                            9. My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

Initially, she made me draw lines, circles, curves and this is how my writing process began. Eventually, I came to know how to write A to Z and 1 to 10. After the initial writing process, she made me read short stories including pictures along with those. As a result, I was able to figure out what the word or sentence said with the help of picture. After completing my initial writing and reading process, Mr. Trivedi, my English teacher, encouraged me a lot to write an essay with different synonyms of a particular word. Eventually, my vocabulary enhanced and there was a good reflection of new words in my essays. The teacher's suggestion not only made me write impressive essays but also enhanced my range of vocabulary. This is how I feel I put a step ahead in my writing process. Questions: 1.

The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a

thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has

not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Covid-19 Shocked the entire world due to its sudden appearance, it caused chaos and panic among-st nations and governments. 2 years ago non of us imagined that we would be stuck in our homes in lock down yet here we are. It did massive economy damages in all countries and caused major problems and inconvenience to people. However and shined a light on a different point of view. It made us realize the the world is finite, our resources are not limitless and that we should learn and educate ourselves to respect those who work day and night to provide food and water for our nations. We should also thank those who constantly put their selves into danger and sacrifice their lives to find a cure to the current pandemic especially the doctors and front liners. Another thing the lock down taught us is that everything is temporary, Nothing stays the same for long  but when it changes doesn't mean it's gone. The lives that were lost during the pandemic were not in vain, and their legacy and memory will live on. Yes death is inevitable but we shouldn't dwell on what's to come but instead live in the moment and create memories as we go, cherish our loved ones because we will never what the future holds.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps &lt;3</p><br />
