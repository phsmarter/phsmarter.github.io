Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public-school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons.First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced.Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing. pa help po plz need lng po thank you​</a>

There is a strong parent-led campaign in your city to curb down on homework or assignments given to students. As a student, however, you feel homework is essential to promoting learning. Write a paper arguing your stand by giving specific examples and statistics to show the benefits of homework. 2. There has been a concentrated campaign in your school to control bullying. While the campaign has been largely successful within schools, bullying has now reared its ugly head in online communities. Explain the difference of online bullying from real-life bullying, and what steps can be taken to prevent it. 3. In a globalized world, learning a foreign language has become increasingly important. Do you agree or disagree? Use facts, statistics, and studies to supplement your views.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a world where globalization has become the norm, the ability to understand and speak a foreign language has become increasingly important. I strongly agree that learning a foreign language is critical for several reasons. Firstly, it allows individuals to communicate with individuals from different parts of the world. Secondly, it can help improve cognitive abilities as individuals who speak multiple languages have been found to perform better in tasks such as problem-solving, creativity, and multitasking. Finally, it can open up new career opportunities and make individuals more marketable in today's job market.</p><p></p><p>Learning a foreign language can help individuals communicate and connect with people from different cultures. As travel becomes more accessible, individuals are finding themselves needing to speak foreign languages to communicate with hotel staff, tour guides, and local residents. For example, individuals who speak Chinese Mandarin can easily interact with individuals living in China, as well as Chinese-speaking individuals in other countries. This can lead to a better and more positive experience for both parties, which can foster deeper connections and stronger relationships.</p><p></p><p>Studies have also shown that individuals who speak multiple languages display better cognitive abilities compared to those who speak only one language. Bilingual individuals have been found to perform better in tasks that require problem-solving and creative thinking. This is because of the cognitive benefits of learning a foreign language. Learning a new language requires individuals to develop better memory, concentration, and multitasking skills, which can help them become more effective in other areas of their lives.</p><p></p><p>Learning a foreign language provides individuals with new career opportunities, making them more marketable in today's job market. With globalization, many multinational companies require their employees to speak at least two languages to communicate with clients, suppliers, and shareholders. This means that individuals who speak a foreign language have a better chance of obtaining a higher salary, job promotions, and new job opportunities. Additionally, learning a foreign language can help individuals interact and network with people from different regions and cultures, further expanding their employment opportunities.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, learning a foreign language is essential in today's globalized world. It provides individuals with the ability to communicate with people from different parts of the world, improves cognitive abilities, and increases career opportunities. With statistics and studies supporting the benefits of learning a foreign language, it's clear that individuals should make every effort to learn a second language.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) answer. </p><p>As a student, I believe that homework is essential to promoting learning, and I do not support the idea of reducing or eliminating it. While I understand the concerns of some parents who feel that their children are being overloaded with homework, I believe that homework has numerous benefits that cannot be ignored.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>As a student, I believe that homework is essential to promoting learning, and I do not support the idea of reducing or eliminating it. While I understand the concerns of some parents who feel that their children are being overloaded with homework, I believe that homework has numerous benefits that cannot be ignored.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, homework promotes independent learning and time management skills. When students are given homework, they are required to complete it on their own, without the immediate support of a teacher. This allows them to develop their own learning strategies and work at their own pace, which is a valuable skill that they will need in higher education and beyond. Furthermore, homework helps students to develop time management skills, as they must learn to balance the demands of school work with other activities and responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, homework provides an opportunity for students to practice and reinforce what they have learned in class. In subjects like mathematics, science, and foreign languages, students need to practice regularly to master the concepts and skills. Homework assignments allow students to apply what they have learned in class to real-world situations, which helps to reinforce the learning and deepen their understanding of the subject matter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, homework provides teachers with a means of assessing student learning and progress. By assigning homework, teachers can evaluate the level of understanding and mastery of the subject matter, and adjust their instruction accordingly. Homework also provides a basis for feedback and evaluation, which is essential for improving student performance.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>With what I have learned, I am going to promote earthquake awareness by explaining to them the cause and the possible results of an earthquake. That by the movement of the plates, which may vary in strength but still very destructive and may cause injuries to those who are not aware. So aside from learning and making a constant practice of doing the duck-cover and hold during an earthquake, we also have to prepare emergency kits containing valuable information and important papers. First aid equipments also with things for survival, such as bandages, food, water and some extra clothings. By explaining to them the hazards and risk brought by an earthquake, they will have the urge to think about it more and be more prepared in case this scenario may happen in the future.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>• Community Quarantine</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hundreds and thousands of people have been infected and have died because of the expansion of epidemics of the new virus that’s spreading around the world known as The coronavirus disease or popularly known as “<strong>covid-19</strong>”.
</p><p>It is said that this pandemic is the global health crisis of our time and the most challenging issue we have faced since World War II. Though, It is said that there are already vaccines for the virus , We all know that they are not free, cheap and states have to pay a lot of money to get sufficient resources for vaccines and the cost is oftentimes not affordable.
</p><p>
</p><p>Community Quarantine is needed to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others. It also helps prevent spread of disease that can occur before a person knows they are sick or if they are infected with the virus without feeling symptoms.

The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are better choice for these three reasons.First, wearing school uniforms would help make students live simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose. Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stress often associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend a meeting in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence dropped by 50 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introduced.Finally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standard of living differs greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show." implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status.

Moreover, uniforms promote a sense of unity and belonging, which may be more important in a school environment.</p><p></p><p>b. Others may argue that implementing school uniforms can be costly for families who cannot afford them. However, many schools have programs to help families obtain uniforms at a low cost or for free.

                        <p>Answer:Tourism marketing is a crucial aspect of the travel and tourism industry that involves promoting destinations, attractions, and services to potential visitors. Effective tourism marketing can help increase visitor numbers, boost local economies, and encourage sustainable tourism practices [2]. One of the key strategies for effective tourism marketing is to establish a strong customer orientation that focuses on regular research of customers' needs and attitudes [1]. This research can help tourism businesses tailor their marketing efforts to meet the specific needs and preferences of different customer segments. Another important aspect of tourism marketing is to allocate resources effectively, including financial, human, and technological resources, to ensure that marketing efforts are targeted and effective in reaching the desired audiences. This may involve using a range of marketing channels, such as social media, digital advertising, and traditional print media, to reach different customer segments. In addition to promoting specific destinations and attractions, tourism marketing can also play a role in promoting sustainable tourism practices. This may involve highlighting environmentally friendly tourism options</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />
