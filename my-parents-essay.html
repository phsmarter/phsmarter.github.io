                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang aking paboritong bayani ay ang aking mga magulang. Sila ang dalawang tao na nagbigay sa akin ng lahat ng aking pangangailangan sa buhay at nagturo sa akin ng lahat ng mga bagay na kailangan ko upang maging isang matagumpay na tao sa hinaharap. Hindi lamang sila nagbigay sa akin ng pag-aaruga at pagmamahal, ngunit sila rin ang nagbigay sa akin ng lakas at tiwala upang harapin ang anumang hamon sa buhay.</p><p></p><p>Ang aking mga magulang ay hindi lamang nagtrabaho upang magbigay sa akin ng isang magandang pamumuhay, ngunit sila rin ay nagtrabaho upang magbigay sa akin ng isang magandang edukasyon. Sila ay laging nandito upang tumulong sa akin sa aking mga pag-aaral at upang magbigay ng payo sa akin sa aking mga desisyon sa buhay.</p><p></p><p>Sa pamamagitan ng kanilang halimbawa, natutunan ko ang kahalagahan ng pagpapakatino, pagtitiis, at pagpapakatino. Sila ay nagpakatino sa akin na maging isang matapat at mabuting tao, at na magpakatino sa aking mga pangarap at mga layunin sa buhay.</p><p></p><p>Sa lahat ng mga bayani na nakilala ko sa buhay, ang aking mga magulang ay ang pinakamahalaga sa akin.

Sila ay tunay na aking mga pangunahing bayani sa buhay.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>        Parents are my heroes. They are both heroes to me not because of what they offered the world, but what they offered me.</p><p></p><p>        To me a hero is someone that you can model yourself after. A person you look up to and strive to be like. To be able to ask yourself what that person would have done in a situation you do not know how to solve. A hero is someone who sets a good example for you and someone with a set of good morals and values. A hero does not always have had to wear a cape and work everyday to save the world. Sometimes our heroes can be normal people. Extraordinary people in my case.</p><p>Throughout life we face challenges and obstacles. Often when facing these obstacles alone, we become afraid or confused. People tend to try and find that …show more content…</p><p>          I admire the two people that worked so extremely hard their whole lives to make sure that me and my brother would grow up feeling loved and like we are the center of someone's world. I admire the fact that my mother worked during the nights while we slept to only get a couple of hours of sleep and be up in the morning when we wake up to take care of us. And my father devoting his energy and time in his company to make sure that me and my brother had everything we wanted and more. I do not understand how my parents did it. Working that much, but still making time for their children. My parents are truly extraordinary people that created a warm and safe environment for me to grow and evolve in. I remember as a young child, if I ever had a bad dream or I was worried that the monsters under my bed would come and take me when I was sleeping. I could always go to My parents room because I knew that no matter what time it was or how early they had to start working the next day they would stay up with me until I fell asleep. I could always count on my heroes to be there whenever I feel like I needed someone. I count on my parents to be there for me even to this day. My parents devoted their whole lives to protecting my brother and I. That's why we love them so much.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

</p><p>Our parents teach us some of the basic etiquette and ethics of life from a young age, so that we can grow up into honest and responsible adults. They shower their blessings and fund our education so that we can grow up as educated and well-mannered individuals. At times, they live in scarcity and teach us to face difficult situations in life gallantly.
</p><p>
</p><p>Parents work hard so that they can provide us with all the basic resources which are helpful for our overall development. They provide mental, emotional and physical support and help us in taking crucial decisions in our life. They sometimes face tough hardship in their lives and protect us from the vices of society.
</p><p>
</p><p>Parents are the most precious gifts of God for children. Parents consist of a father and mother who give birth to us and nurture us with love and affection right from childhood. Our parents take care of us from the day we come into this world as infants and nurture us until we have grown old enough to take care of ourselves.
</p><p>
</p><p>My parents always encourage us to participate in various indoor and outdoor games.
</p><p>
</p><p>I love both my parents and pray to God for their well-being at all times.</p><p></p><p>[tex]\left[\begin{array}{ccc}CarryonLearning\\-ParkWooMun-\\BrainliestChallenge2021\end{array}\right][/tex]</p><br />
