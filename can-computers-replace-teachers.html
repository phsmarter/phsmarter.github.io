Compare and contrast through a Venn diagram the words teacher and computer based from the given text. Title : COMPUTER'S (TECHNOLOGY) AND TEACHER'SIn schools, colleges, or universities, the teacher acts as the mentors to the students when they face any issues. After the college hours, if they encounter any problem, then the student has to wait for the next day. But the days are changing day-by-day; the students with the use of technology get the answers to their questions. When you want to learn a new language, then you have to attend the language training academy. Now, the users are getting the training classes at the fingertips by watching it on their mobiles or any other gadgets. Moreover, the teachers may be expert in a few subjects, but you can get everything with the technology and turn into an expert. If you have any doubt, you have to go and meet the concerned teacher to clarify your doubt. Now, the users are getting the training classes at the fingertips by watching it on their mobiles or any other gadgets. Moreover, the teachers may be expert in a few subjects, but you can get everything with the technology and turn into an expert. If you have any doubt, you have to go and meet the concerned teacher to clarify your doubt. But with the computers, by sitting in one location, you can get all answers to the questions. A library consists of almost 1 Lakh books, but there are huge collections of e-books in the internet world. When compared the teachers with the computers, the technology will not teach the ethics, way of life, or moral values but the teacher along with the subject can teach how to live with the moral values, ethics &amp; integrity, and the responsibilities. The technology can’t replace the teachers because the teacher itself says how to use the technology in a right way. The best example of this is, the calculator cannot replace the mathematics teacher. A teacher can grasp the interest of the students but the computer cannot find out the interesting subjects of the students. Some of the students can’t afford the fees for their studies; in this case, the technology will help in preparing their studies.​</a>

Title : COMPUTER'S (TECHNOLOGY) AND TEACHER'SIn schools, colleges, or universities, the teacher acts as the mentors to the students when they face any issues. After the college hours, if they encounter any problem, then the student has to wait for the next day. But the days are changing day-by-day; the students with the use of technology get the answers to their questions. When you want to learn a new language, then you have to attend the language training academy. Now, the users are getting the training classes at the fingertips by watching it on their mobiles or any other gadgets. Moreover, the teachers may be expert in a few subjects, but you can get everything with the technology and turn into an expert. If you have any doubt, you have to go and meet the concerned teacher to clarify your doubt. Now, the users are getting the training classes at the fingertips by watching it on their mobiles or any other gadgets. Moreover, the teachers may be expert in a few subjects, but you can get everything with the technology and turn into an expert. If you have any doubt, you have to go and meet the concerned teacher to clarify your doubt. But with the computers, by sitting in one location, you can get all answers to the questions. A library consists of almost 1 Lakh books, but there are huge collections of e-books in the internet world. When compared the teachers with the computers, the technology will not teach the ethics, way of life, or moral values but the teacher along with the subject can teach how to live with the moral values, ethics &amp; integrity, and the responsibilities. The technology can’t replace the teachers because the teacher itself says how to use the technology in a right way. The best example of this is, the calculator cannot replace the mathematics teacher. A teacher can grasp the interest of the students but the computer cannot find out the interesting subjects of the students. Some of the students can’t afford the fees for their studies; in this case, the technology will help in preparing their studies.​</h2><br />

                        <p> I believe that while technology has advanced significantly in recent years, it cannot completely replace the role of a teacher. A teacher provides more than just information and instruction; they also offer guidance, support, and encouragement that are essential for a student's overall development. While computers can provide information and instruction, they cannot provide the same level of personal interaction and emotional support that a teacher can.</p><p></p><p>One way to differentiate a computer from a teacher is by their ability to connect with students on a personal level. A teacher can adjust their teaching style to suit each student's individual learning needs and can offer emotional support and guidance when needed. A computer, on the other hand, provides a standardized approach and may not be able to offer the same level of personalization or emotional support. Additionally, a teacher can serve as a role model and provide inspiration and motivation to students, which is not possible with a computer.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Everyone has a different perception. But what I believe is that the answer to the above stated arguments is a big ‘No’. Technology cannot replace a teacher. Technology is merely an augmentation to a teacher. It can help the process of learning, but it certainly cannot replace the role of the teacher.</p><p></p><p>Technology can make it easy to get educated by sitting at home but that education too is provided by a teacher. Even in online courses, we see that teachers are necessary to give lectures, whether in the form of videos, tutorials, Skype sessions, etc. Children still need to learn computers to operate those online sessions, which of course are taught by teachers.</p><p></p><p>2. I can say a teacher is very important in shaping a good human being by training with the moral values, responsibilities, and way of life. Even the technology or computers are also important to get the adequate knowledge of different streams. So, both the teachers and computers are important for all of us to meet our requirements.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps:3</p><br />

6. A recent encyclopedia entry about dogs cites multiple research papers done by scientists at veterinary schools. According to the article, Labrador retrievers come in two specific breeds: English and American. The English breed is described as stocky and heavy, while the American breed is described as tall and lanky. The article describes current scientific research as showing that males of both breeds usually weigh about 29-41 kg (65-90 lb), and females weigh 25-32 kg (55-70 lb). Coat colors for both breeds come in solid black, yellow, or chocolate. All labs have strong tails and webbed feet, which help them swim. Devon would like to use this information to determine if his new dog is an English or American Labrador retriever. 
Which best describes the reliability of the information?
A. It is not reliable because only scientists can use scientific information for reference.
B. It is not reliable because it doesn’t talk about how to test and only gives data about the breeds.
C. It is reliable because the article is based on multiple studies done by scientists at multiple veterinary schools.
D. It is reliable because it gives information about both types of Labradors in addition to information about other types of dogs.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>1. D. </strong>We are given a solution that is 2.50 L, and the conversion that 1 quart =0.943 liters.

</p><p>The data shows the relation of pressure and temperature, and the relationship between two quantities is best shown as a graph. Options A,B and D will still just give a lot of numbers which a layperson would probably have a difficult time understanding. Option D especially is a big NO, because you shouldn't just remove data like that. More than simplifying the results, it would change the results.</p><p>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.)While computers and technology can be incredibly useful tools in education, it's not currently possible to completely replace teachers with computers. Teachers provide students with guidance, support, and personalized attention that a computer program simply cannot replicate. Additionally, human teachers can adapt to changing situations and individual student needs, while a computer program may not have that flexibility.</p><p></p><p>2.)Social media can be both a good and a bad influence for kids, depending on how it's used. On the positive side, social media can help kids connect with friends and family, access educational resources, and develop social skills. However, social media can also expose kids to cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and the pressure to conform to unrealistic standards. It's important for parents and guardians to monitor their children's social media use and teach them how to use it responsibly.</p><p></p><p>3.)There is no clear consensus on whether or not schools should give homework on Fridays. Some argue that it's important for students to have time to relax and spend time with family and friends over the weekend, while others believe that giving homework on Friday helps students develop time management skills and stay on top of their work. Ultimately, the decision should be based on the specific needs and goals of the school and its students.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>In my opinion, we can't replace teachers with computers due to the fact that teachers explain better than computers and teachers makes sure that we learned the lesson thoroughly.To me, social media has both advantages and disadvantages for kids because they can learn something educational from social media and can also see some inappropriate things.I agree not to send homework during Friday for it is the day before the weekends where students can take a break from studying.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Yours Truly</p><p>-Journalist Jez</p><br />
