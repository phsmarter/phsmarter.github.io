                                            According to Huxley, an essay is a piece of writing that gives an author's own argument. It
is a "prose composition with a focused subject of discussion" or a "long, systematic discourse". Aldous
Huxley, a leading essayist, says that the essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about
almost anything. He suggests that essays can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of
reference. First is the personal and the autobiographical (i.e., the essayists write fragments of reflective
autobiography and look at the world through anecdotes and descriptions). Second is the objective, the
factual, and the concrete particular (i.e., the essayists do not speak directly of themselves, but turn their
attention outward to some literary or scientific or political theme. Essayists pass judgment and draw
general conclusions from the presentation relevant data. Third, is the abstract-universal (i.e., the
essayists do their work in the world of high abstractions). They are never personal and they seldom
mention the particular facts of experience. The most satisfying essays make the best not of one, not of
two, but of all the three worlds in which it is possible for the essay to exist.
Apply Huxley’s analysis to the essays of Rizal, as a whole, and briefly write about your insights in an
essay.</a>

                            2. Make an argumentative essay about political issues​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Political issues are some of the most contentious and divisive topics in modern society. From debates over healthcare and education to disputes over immigration and gun control, political issues have the power to shape the direction of entire nations. In this essay, we will explore some of the most significant political issues facing our world today and argue for a more thoughtful and collaborative approach to addressing these challenges.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One of the most pressing political issues facing our world today is the growing threat of climate change. Rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events are already having profound effects on the planet, from disrupting food systems to exacerbating poverty and inequality. The scientific consensus is clear: urgent action is needed to mitigate the effects of climate change and transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>However, political leaders and policymakers have been slow to respond to this crisis. Many have been influenced by powerful fossil fuel interests and political ideologies that prioritize short-term economic growth over long-term sustainability. As a result, we have seen inadequate action and outright denial of the reality of climate change, putting future generations at risk.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another significant political issue facing our world today is the rise of nationalism and populism. Across the globe, we have seen the emergence of leaders and movements that appeal to people's fears and prejudices, often at the expense of marginalized groups and democratic institutions. This trend is fueled by factors such as economic insecurity, cultural dislocation, and the proliferation of social media, which has enabled the spread of disinformation and hate speech.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>While nationalism and populism may offer a sense of identity and community for some, they ultimately undermine the principles of democracy and human rights that are essential for a just and equitable society. Instead of promoting division and hostility, we need political leaders who can foster dialogue and collaboration across diverse communities, and who are committed to protecting the rights and dignity of all people.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Finally, political issues surrounding inequality and social justice are increasingly urgent. Despite progress in some areas, such as gender and LGBTQ+ rights, we still see profound disparities in income, wealth, and opportunity between different groups of people. This inequality is perpetuated by systemic factors such as racism, sexism, and ableism, as well as economic policies that favor the wealthy and powerful.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>To address these challenges, we need political leaders who are willing to take bold action to address inequality and promote social justice. This includes policies such as progressive taxation, affordable healthcare and education, and investments in affordable housing and public transportation. It also requires a fundamental shift in the way we think about wealth and power, moving away from individualism and competition and towards cooperation and solidarity.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, political issues are complex and multifaceted, and they require thoughtful and collaborative approaches to address. We must take urgent action to address issues such as climate change, nationalism, and inequality, and we need political leaders who are committed to promoting dialogue and collaboration across diverse communities. By working together, we can build a more just, equitable, and sustainable world for all people.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Fake news can change the social and political life </strong>of a person. Receiving fake news can affect our decision in many ways. For example, you are about to meet a client in a neighbouring town, but you received a news that the town was bombed. So as a result, you cancelled the meeting. But you later found out that it was fake news. And it’s too late already because you already cancelled a very important meeting. Another example is receiving fake news about a big calamity. Then people tend to do a panic buying in grocery stores. These changes are one of the social changes because of fake news.  <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/919086</strong></p><p>The political life of a person especially the <strong>beliefs can also change because of fake news</strong>. Take this an example because many fake news will be released when the election is near. If you hear that an official is immoral, which is intentional fake news, there is a tendency that you will not vote him because nobody wants a bad person to lead a community. If you also hear negative things about the official’s immediate family, you probably won’t vote for him because everybody wants to vote an official who has good family background. Same as giving positive fake news, you will vote a candidate who has positive feedback, without even knowing that those were false news.  <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/1877816</strong></p><p>Fake news is very rampant nowadays especially in social media. What is the <strong>best way to discover fake news</strong>? Investigate. If you don’t have the initiative to investigate, you will believe the fake news. So don’t be blinded with fake news, you can find the truth anymore in the reliable platform.  <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/1751898</strong></p><br /><br />

Libraries have a multitude of benefits, and many are only available if the library has a physical location. Some of these benefits include acting as a quiet study space, giving people a way to converse with their neighbors, holding classes on a variety of topics, providing jobs, answering patron questions, and keeping the community connected. One neighborhood found that, after a local library instituted community events such as play times for toddlers and parents, job fairs for teenagers, and meeting spaces for senior citizens, over a third of residents reported feeling more connected to their community. Similarly, a Pew survey conducted in 2015 found that nearly two-thirds of American adults feel that closing their local library would have a major impact on their community. People see libraries as a way to connect with others and get their questions answered, benefits tablets can’t offer nearly as well or as easily.</p><p></p><p>          While replacing libraries with tablets may seem like a simple solution, it would encourage people to spend even more time looking at digital screens, despite the myriad issues surrounding them. It would also end access to many of the benefits of libraries that people have come to rely on. In many areas, libraries are such an important part of the community network that they could never be replaced by a simple object.</p><br />

                            12. According to Huxley, an essay is a piece of writing that gives an author's own argument. It
is a "prose composition with a focused subject of discussion" or a "long, systematic discourse". Aldous
Huxley, a leading essayist, says that the essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about
almost anything. He suggests that essays can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of
reference. First is the personal and the autobiographical (i.e., the essayists write fragments of reflective
autobiography and look at the world through anecdotes and descriptions). Second is the objective, the
factual, and the concrete particular (i.e., the essayists do not speak directly of themselves, but turn their
attention outward to some literary or scientific or political theme. Essayists pass judgment and draw
general conclusions from the presentation relevant data. Third, is the abstract-universal (i.e., the
essayists do their work in the world of high abstractions). They are never personal and they seldom
mention the particular facts of experience. The most satisfying essays make the best not of one, not of
two, but of all the three worlds in which it is possible for the essay to exist.
Apply Huxley’s analysis to the essays of Rizal, as a whole, and briefly write about your insights in an

                        <p><strong>Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity​</strong></p><p>Sexual orientation and gender identity are two crucial aspects of a person's identity that have been the subject of much debate and controversy over the years. While some argue that individuals should have the right to express themselves and love who they choose, others argue that certain sexual orientations and gender identities are unnatural or immoral. However, it is important to recognize that sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent parts of a person's identity that should be respected and protected.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, sexual orientation is a natural and normal part of human diversity. People can have different sexual orientations, including heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and asexual. It is not a choice but rather an inherent characteristic of an individual's identity. People cannot control who they are attracted to, and it is not something that can be changed or "cured" through therapy or other methods. Therefore, it is important to recognize and respect the diversity of sexual orientations.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, gender identity is also an inherent part of a person's identity. Gender identity refers to an individual's sense of their own gender, which can be male, female, or non-binary. Like sexual orientation, gender identity is not a choice but rather a part of who a person is. It is important to recognize and respect the gender identity of individuals, regardless of whether it aligns with their biological sex.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ often face discrimination and marginalization in society. This discrimination can manifest in many ways, including harassment, violence, and unequal treatment in areas such as employment, housing, and healthcare. This discrimination can have a significant impact on the mental and physical health of individuals who identify as LGBTQ+, and can lead to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>In addition to discrimination, individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ also face legal barriers that limit their rights and freedoms. For example, in many countries, same-sex marriage is not recognized, and LGBTQ+ individuals are denied the right to adopt children or access fertility treatments. These legal barriers can further contribute to the marginalization and discrimination of LGBTQ+ individuals.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent parts of a person's identity that should be respected and protected. Discrimination and marginalization of individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity are not only unfair but also harmful. It is important for society to recognize the diversity of sexual orientations and gender identities and to work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting world for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>The Philippines has been labeled as a third-world nation for many reasons. Some of these reasons are that the country has a high level of poverty, low Human Development Index (HDI) ranking, and is susceptible to natural disasters. </p><p></p><p>One of the main reasons why the Philippines is considered a third-world nation is because of its high level of poverty. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, as of 2015, more than 26% of the population lives below the poverty line. This means that they cannot afford to meet their basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter. </p><p></p><p>Another reason why the Philippines is considered a third-world nation is because of its low HDI ranking. The HDI is a measure of a country’s level of development and is based on three dimensions: life expectancy, education, and income. The Philippines’ HDI ranking is currently at 0.686, which puts it in the category of “low human development”. </p><p></p><p>Lastly, the Philippines is susceptible to natural disasters. This is because the country is located in a region that is prone to earthquakes, typhoons, and floods. For example, in 2013, Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines and left more than 6,000 people dead. </p><p></p><p>There are several solutions that can be implemented in order to address the issues of poverty, low HDI ranking, and susceptibility to natural disasters. One solution is to increase investment in education. This can be done by increasing the budget for education, and by making education more accessible to all.
