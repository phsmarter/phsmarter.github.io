"A good parent reads stories to their children every day."
I have three reasons for believing the quote.____
I can proudly say
that my parents read to me bible stories before going to bed._____
I grow up
relating my personal experiences with the stories I listened to. ______
stories
widen my perspective in life. _____
when life is hard, I would most of the time
ponder on the lessons I have learned from stories that my parents read to me. And ______
stories are my guide in making difficult choices. It is like hearing my
mother or father giving me advices even if they are not around. ______
I can say
that I have a good parent.</a>
