                                            .In line with the Pandemic brought by COVID-19, Filipinos embraced the digital world as they stayed at home. There was significant increase on videoconferencing and on-line meeting via Skype, Zoom or Lark. Movie subscription via Netflix grew enormously with an additional of 15.8 million new subscribers during the first three months of 2020. In addition, the demand for data communications grew exponentially and internet traffic have recorded more than 40% during the Luzon-wide quarantine. With this, there was a new term coined referred to as “digital normal” where people will permanently be glued to live, work and play in the digital world. With the advent of the digital normal, organization and companies need to make a paradigm shift on their business models, processes and competencies to take advantage of the digital transformation.

                        <strong>Sitio Katamakawan</strong><p>Question 1: </p><p>No, there overall behavior about values and such weren’t that much of a problem but all those things about living a lazy and unhealthy lifestyle every single day are very tiring and not beneficial to your mind and body. Though values and respect are there you can almost do that even if you are working diligently and eating healthy or even doing activities to preserve your own health.
</p><p>Question 2: </p><p>These are the Dimensions of <strong>Health</strong>:
</p>Physical- our body’s overall health
Mental- our mental health focuses on our emotions and how our brain perceives and take thoughts
Spiritual- grabbing hold onto faith and religion and using that to strengthen beliefs, being one with things
Intellectual- maintaining a sharp mind by learning and making use of our brain to do almost anything  Social- being active in socializing or establishing communication to other people
Emotional-controlling our emotions and making it our own advantage
<p>The dimension of <strong>health </strong>that was sustained or met by the community Sitio Katamakawan is Spiritual. For the other dimensions mentioned above, they were quite difficult to see. Spiritual, because they still somewhat make time to go to church and have respect for other people. But they don’t have a healthy emotional, intellectual, physical, mental health since they are mostly stuck on playing virtual games or lazing around.  </p><p>Question 3: </p><p>No, they do not in fact they live the exact opposite of a physically active and healthy lifestyle. Examples are:
</p><p>The lazy around
</p>They eat almost everything they wanted without thinking of its side effects to their own body
They use other people to do their own chores
Teenagers’ minds are mostly into playing games and surfing the internet
<p>Question 4: </p><p>Possibly:
</p>Obesity- due to eating too much
Diabetes- maybe by consuming too much sugar
Heart Failure- too much fat consumption
High Blood Pressure- the result of being overweight
Cancer (for a most severe and long term unhealthy lifestyle)- maybe in kidneys, uterine or liver
<p>Question 5:  </p>The risk factor of Obesity is gaining other diseases that are highly related to this case such as High Blood Pressure.
Diabetes increases the sugar content of our body and makes us susceptible to other injuries and diseases
Heart Failure can lead to the clogging or stopping of the heart worst-case scenario. Our heart functions perfectly because of our healthy living, do the opposite and it will lead to a heavy burden.
High Blood Pressure occurs for a long time and there isn’t a stated thing that will cure it permanently of a person.
Cancer leads to a shortened lifespan and makes the person very weak or even much weaker than he is now.
<p>Question 6:
</p><p>If I were to have a friend there in Sitio Katamakawan, I would advise him to not follow other people’s lifestyle and maybe tell him the risks if he continues to live his life that way. He can start by stopping those things that he mostly does aside from going to church and being respectable to the elders.  </p><p>He needs to clear his own fridge out of junk and too much fatty food and replace it with greens and less fatty meats. Then he needs to stop using technologies for hours, lessen their usage time and do some physical exercises.
</p><p>Question 7: </p>The advantages of technology is that it allows us to respond to our <strong>health</strong> needs and keeping track of it by simply searching and using technology to advise us about what are the best options to achieve a healthy lifestyle.
The disadvantage of technology is the same freedom it gives us to mostly do everything by the use of it. We can be so engrossed in using technology due to its convenience we expose ourselves to harmful stuff from it and we have less time to actually maintain our physical health.
<p>Question 8:</p>For the children, they can play outside the thought of “to avoiding accidents” is very primitive and constricting. Accidents happen even indoors you can’t actually prevent it for everybody.  For teenagers, they can start doing physical exercises or exercise their own brains by studying and reading books.
For adults, they can also engage themselves in physical exercises and watch what they eat.

D. The scientist seeks input and data from a wide range of people of different scientific backgrounds and then publishes all the data and results on the Internet so that all the collaborators can apply it to their individual research.
6. A recent encyclopedia entry about dogs cites multiple research papers done by scientists at veterinary schools. According to the article, Labrador retrievers come in two specific breeds: English and American. The English breed is described as stocky and heavy, while the American breed is described as tall and lanky. The article describes current scientific research as showing that males of both breeds usually weigh about 29-41 kg (65-90 lb), and females weigh 25-32 kg (55-70 lb). Coat colors for both breeds come in solid black, yellow, or chocolate. All labs have strong tails and webbed feet, which help them swim. Devon would like to use this information to determine if his new dog is an English or American Labrador retriever. 
Which best describes the reliability of the information?
A. It is not reliable because only scientists can use scientific information for reference.
B. It is not reliable because it doesn’t talk about how to test and only gives data about the breeds.
C. It is reliable because the article is based on multiple studies done by scientists at multiple veterinary schools.
D. It is reliable because it gives information about both types of Labradors in addition to information about other types of dogs.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>1. D. </strong>We are given a solution that is 2.50 L, and the conversion that 1 quart =0.943 liters.

</p><p>D. Computers hold larger amounts of data.</p><p>Options  A-C are actually advantages of a graphing calculator. Because it is more portable (B), it is easier to use for quick calculations (A). Since it's also smaller, it has a lower power consumption (C). Computers, however, because of their computing capacity can hold larger amounts of data.</p><br /><p><strong>3.

</p><p>D. Create a question on the cause of a chemical reaction.</p><p>Options A, B, and D are part of pre-lab and post-lab procedures. Only option C  actually needs to be done during the experiment. You'd need A and D (hypothesis and question) before lab, to know what to test. Option B would come after the lab experiment, because there is already a completed lab report.</p><br /><p><strong>4.C.</strong> A scientist collected the following data, which show how the pressure of water vapor changes with temperature.

</p><p>D. Display only rows 1, 3, and 6 of the data to simplify results.
</p><p>The data shows the relation of pressure and temperature, and the relationship between two quantities is best shown as a graph. Options A,B and D will still just give a lot of numbers which a layperson would probably have a difficult time understanding. Option D especially is a big NO, because you shouldn't just remove data like that. More than simplifying the results, it would change the results.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>5. A. </strong>A filmmaker wants to depict a realistic dramatization of a scientist making and communicating an important scientific discovery. Which plot description would best depict the methods of discovery and communication that a modern professional scientist uses?

</p><p>D. The scientist seeks input and data from a wide range of people of different scientific backgrounds and then publishes all the data and results on the Internet so that all the collaborators can apply it to their individual research.
</p><p>Option A is the answer because it is the only one that mentions peer reviews before releasing results. This is an important part of scientists discoveries since the discovery must be double-checked first before announced. It would just cause confusion if a scientist announces a wrong discovery.</p><p>

</p><p>D. It is reliable because it gives information about both types of Labradors in addition to information about other types of dogs.
</p><p>Options B and D talk more about the completeness of the information rather than the reliability. Option A is not true, since scientific information can be used by anyone as reference.
