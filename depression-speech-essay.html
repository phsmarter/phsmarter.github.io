                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Depression is very different from the occasional blues. About 18.8 million Americans experience depressive disorders that affect how they sleep, eat, feel about themselves, and live their lives. Depression can run in families, and it usually starts between the ages of 15 and 30. Depression has physical and emotional symptoms and cannot be wished away; people with depression can't just "pull themselves together." There are different types of depressive disorders, each with its own symptoms and treatment options. The good news is that depression can be treated, and people can recover.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The four major causes of depression are:</p><p></p><p>Family history. Though there are no specific genes that we can look at and trace to depression, if your family members have had depression, you are more likely also to experience depression. ... </p><p></p><p>Illness and health issues. ... </p><p></p><p>Medication, drugs, and alcohol. ... </p><p></p><p>Personality.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>https:/www.medicinet.com</p><br />

                        Depression is always going to be there with us. We may be depress because of school, family, friends and etc. but it can't rule our lives. Depression must always be avoided, why? Because many lives may be affected and tdo bad things to them selves. To avoid this we must avoid bashing and start loving. Always Remember that God has plans, really great one's, always give god time with his plans. <p>Life is how one makes of it. The total of all of man's experiences are meant to mold and make him the best he can be. Whatever trials and tribulations, challenges and heartaches, rejections and even deaths, these are all made so that man will become the ultimate of his previous 'self.' Sadly, however, there are certain instances in life when man seem to lose hope and that he sees no reason to continue or at least struggle to pursue his dreams, whims, and ambitions. At that moment when he is all down and out, the ebb of all that is lost... this is depression. </p><p>Only the brave can and will stand against this alter ego of ourselves. Only the determined mind can shun the shroud of darkness that would envelope his sanity and sense of purpose. Families may shower love to qualm a tired and doubting heart; friends may offer shoulders to cry on and listening ears, but only the person himself can totally shun the darkness, run out from the cloud of negativity and into the sunlight. Only then can he see the stark difference between seeing and believing; only then can he see hope!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Here are some possible ideas for an essay about stress, depression, and anxiety:</p><p></p><p>Definition and symptoms: Start by defining stress, depression, and anxiety and exploring their common symptoms. Explain how these conditions can affect people's physical and emotional health, relationships, and daily functioning.</p><p></p><p>Causes and triggers: Discuss some of the main causes and triggers of stress, depression, and anxiety. These may include genetic factors, environmental stressors, trauma, negative thought patterns, and unhealthy coping mechanisms. Explore the ways in which different factors can interact to exacerbate these conditions.</p><p></p><p>Effects on mental and physical health: Discuss the negative impact that stress, depression, and anxiety can have on people's mental and physical health. Describe how these conditions can affect brain chemistry, sleep, appetite, immune function, and other bodily systems. Explain how chronic stress can increase the risk of developing physical health problems, such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes.</p><p></p><p>Coping mechanisms: Explore some of the common coping mechanisms that people use to deal with stress, depression, and anxiety. These may include exercise, relaxation techniques, social support, therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. Discuss the benefits and limitations of these coping strategies, and provide examples of how people can incorporate them into their daily routines.</p><p></p><p>Stigma and discrimination: Discuss the social stigma and discrimination that can be associated with mental health conditions like stress, depression, and anxiety. Describe the ways in which these conditions are often misunderstood or dismissed, and explain how this can prevent people from seeking the help they need. Offer suggestions for how society can work to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health.</p><p></p><p>Prevention and early intervention: Finally, discuss the importance of prevention and early intervention when it comes to stress, depression, and anxiety. Explain how people can identify early warning signs and seek help before these conditions become more severe. Provide examples of how schools, workplaces, and healthcare systems can promote mental health and provide support for those who are struggling.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Suicide is the deliberate self-infliction of harm to die. When someone damages themselves to end their life but does not pass away as a result of their acts, it is considered a suicide attempt. Many factors both enhance and increase the chance of suicide. There is a link between suicide and other types of harm and violence. Those who have experienced violence, such as child abuse, bullying, or sexual violence, for instance, are more likely to commit suicide. Suicidal thoughts and behaviors can be reduced by having simple access to health care, connections to family and community support, and these things.</p><p></p><p>                     </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>CARRYONLEARNING</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>To me, depression is the constant feeling of being numb. Being numb to emotions, being numb to life, and being numb to your senses. It’s about waking up in the morning and wanting to go straight back to bed. Depression is as if you have come to a point in your life where you no longer want to see what is in front of you because the past is where you want to spend the majority of your time. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Depression - a hidden threat<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Depression is a hidden threat that should be unmasked. And it will require the help of everybody to do so. Did you know that depression affects most of us? Did you also know that depression is a sickness that needs to be treated? That it is not something that you can just brush off and say "Be positive. Don't be sad."</p><p></p><p>Depression according to the DSM V is a very serious medical condition. It is also very common. It is that persistent feeling of sadness that usually do not go away even after two weeks. The symptoms are varied which includes feeling that you are not worthy of anything, suicidal thoughts, over or under eating and over or under sleeping. The cause is associated with an imbalance in the neurotransmitters inside our brains. The solution? There are two ways: behavioral therapy and medication. For milder cases of depression, behavioral therapy would be enough. But for major depression, a combination of behavioral therapy and anti-depressants might be needed. </p><p></p><p>So knowing that depression can be treated how do we solve the problem of being stigmatized if you have a mental illness? First is a paradigm shift. Treat it like any illness, like a cold or headache. One does not get shunned out of the society if they have a cold. The second is offer help. Often the happiest people that you know are the people internally struggling with depression. Ask if they are okay. Talk to them. Let them know that you genuinely care. </p><p></p><p>Don't solve the problem by creating another problem. In high school, one reason why students get depressed are because of low grades or a failed love life. Know that these can be remedied by studying more efficiently and finding another person to love. Don't drink as alcohol is habit forming and is a strong depressant as well. If you are already depressed why take a depressant. It is like having a headache and treating the headache by slamming your head into a wall.</p><p></p><p>In sum, we need to be aware of and accepting of people with depression, Know that it exists and that solutions are available to remedy that situation.</p><p></p><p><strong>For more information:</strong></p><p>Depression: https://brainly.ph/question/2373753</p><br />

A depressed person lives in a nightmarish world, darkened by pessimism and dulled by unwillingness to act. This devastating and destructive state has a negative impact on the individual. It drains energy, evaporates optimism and enthusiasm, and paralyzes hope. It distorts the world and substantially reduces the pleasure of living. It may lead to repetitive suicidal thoughts that can end in self-destruction.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>correct me if I'm wrong(✿^‿^)</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>          Dealing with Depression During Coronavirus</p><p>In the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by hopelessness and despair. But these tips can help improve your mood and ease depression.</p><p>          When you’re suffering from depression, life can seem overwhelmingly bleak and hopeless. It can interfere with your ability to think straight, drain your energy, and make it difficult to get through the day. Even as some countries and regions begin to ease stay-at-home restrictions, it seems unlikely that life will fully return to normal any time soon. But no matter what constraints you’re living under at the moment, these strategies can help you counteract loneliness, ease negative thoughts, improve your mood, and cope with symptoms of depression.</p><p>          When depression makes you feel suicidal, your problems don’t seem temporary, they seem overwhelming and permanent. But with time, you will feel better, especially if you get help. There are many people who want to support you during this difficult time, so please reach out!</p><p>          Isolation and loneliness fuels depression. Human beings are social creatures. Being cut off from the love, support, and close contact of family and friends can trigger depression or make existing symptoms worse. Months of social distancing and sheltering at home can leave you feeling isolated and lonely, having to face your problems alone.</p><p>          A troubled relationship may be even worse than loneliness. While strong and supportive relationships are crucial for your mental wellbeing, being forced to spend months quarantined in a troubled, unhappy, or abusive relationship can be even more damaging to your mood than being alone.</p><p>          Anxiety can lead to depression. All the fear and uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 means it’s natural to worry. When your worries spiral out of control, though, they can cause panic and anxiety. Since anxiety and depression are believed to stem from the same biological vulnerability, one can often lead to the other.</p><p>          Stress levels are soaring. Experiencing a major change in your life, such the death of a loved one, the loss of a job, being diagnosed with a serious illness, or financial or relationship difficulties, can bring overwhelming levels of stress. As a result of this pandemic, you may be experiencing several of these major stressors at once, making you more vulnerable to depression.</p><p>          We’re turning to unhealthy ways of coping. The boredom, loneliness and stress of being in lockdown, struggling financially, or having to juggle a job and home school your kids, can prompt unhealthy ways of coping. Maybe you’re drinking too much, abusing drugs, or overeating junk food in an attempt to self-medicate your mood and deal with stress. While these methods may provide a brief respite, in the long-run they’ll make your depression symptoms much worse. Instead, you can use the following healthy strategies to boost your mood and ease your depression.</p><p></p><br />
