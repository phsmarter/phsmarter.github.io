A force is a push or pull, which occurs when two or more objects interactwith each other2. The shape of an object may change when force is applied3. Pushing is a kind of force that has no effect in any existing material4. Rubbers could change its shape by applying force to it5. We can't change the shape of paper even we use a force on it6. When force is applied to an object, the size of an object may change7 Dropping a flower vase on floor makes the vase broken into pieces8. Pounding a Styrofoam cup wouldn't change its size,9. If you break an egg, its size will change but not the shape,10. Sharpening a pencil will make it longer.​</a>

                                            1. Meredith sniffed the air. She smelled the scent of her best friend, Taylor. She jumped up excitedly and ran towards the front door. She knew Taylor would arrive any minute and she could barely contain her joy. Her tail wagged faster and faster. Finally, Taylor came in! She jumped up on him and gave him a big kiss. Who is Meredith? How do you know?2. Brendon grunted as he walked into the house. He carried four paper bags in his arms, each one filled to the brim. Suddenly, he tripped and one of the bags fell, spilling oranges, a loaf of bread, and two sticks of butter onto the floor. "At least I didn't drop the eggs!" he exclaimed. Where was Brendon before he got home? How do you know?3. Khalil arrived home from school with a grin. He burst through the front door and ran into the living room where he saw boxes wrapped in shiny paper and balloons tied to a chair. On the counter sat a chocolate cake with eleven candles. He reached for a taste of the frosting, but his mother scolded, "We have to sing to you before eating the cake!" What is Khalil celebrating? How do you know?4. It was dawn when Pepito heard the sound of a rooster crowing. That was his signal that it was time to get up. He quickly dressed and, on his way out the door, he pulled on a pair of muddy boots. Outside the smell of sweet hay filled the air. He whistled as he sprinkled handfuls of grain and corn across the dewy ground. Then, he grabbed an empty bucket and smiled to himself as he thought about the fresh milk that would soon fill it.Where does Pepito live? How do you know?5. Gabbi grinned as she looked into the mirror. Her face was smeared with paint and she couldn't be happier. She pulled on her black dress and pointy black hat. As a final touch, she tucked a few wispy spider webs into her hair. Finally, she was ready. She grabbed her orange bag and headed out into the night. As she disappeared into the darkness, she heard her mom yell, "Don't eat too much candy tonight!" What day is it? How do you know?​</a>

My neighbor, Mr. Clark, just bought a new car. It is a beautiful, 2008, black Mercedes. He chose gray leather interior and the seats are even heated for those cold, Kansas winters. He washes it every weekened, so that it always looks shiny. 2. One of my favorite things to eat in the summer time is tomatoes. Because they are so expensive at the store, I decided to grow my own tomatoes last summer. Unfortunately, the plants didn't produce many tomatoes. One day, I thought I had better look at the plants carefully to see what the problem might be. Sure enough, I found little white bugs all over the leaves. 3. Holly and Molly are identical twins. Although they look exactly alike, everything else about them is different. Holly likes to play sports and enjoys listening to rock and hip-hop music. Molly would much rather read and play classical music on the piano with her free time. They dress differently, too. Holly likes to wear casual clothes, but Molly prefers to dress up every day. Even though they lead very different lives, Holly and Molly love each other very much and enjoy discussing their day every night. 4. Last night, I made chocolate chip cookies. First, I pre-heated the oven to 375°C. Then, I blended butter, brown sugar, and an egg together. After that I stirred in flour, salt and baking soda, Next, I stirred in chocolate chips. Finally, I dropped them by the spoonful on a baking sheet. After twelve minutes. At last, we ate! Yum, yum! 5. Mark was very upset. He tore his house upside down looking for the science study guide his teacher had given him. He had a very important test the next day, and he needed a high score to get a good grade in science. Just when he was about to give up, he thought of a great idea. He would call his friend Jeff Jeff was in the same class; he would be able to tell him what was on the study guide. Mark called Jeff. Jeff was more than happy to help. They studied together on the phone for an hour. When Mark hung up, he was relieved. He was thankful for Jeff's help. He was confident that he would get an "A" on science.​</a>

                            10. 1. Meredith sniffed the air. She smelled the scent of her best friend, Taylor. She jumped up excitedly and ran towards the front door. She knew Taylor would arrive any minute and she could barely contain her joy. Her tail wagged faster and faster. Finally, Taylor came in! She jumped up on him and gave him a big kiss. Who is Meredith? How do you know?2. Brendon grunted as he walked into the house. He carried four paper bags in his arms, each one filled to the brim. Suddenly, he tripped and one of the bags fell, spilling oranges, a loaf of bread, and two sticks of butter onto the floor. "At least I didn't drop the eggs!" he exclaimed. Where was Brendon before he got home? How do you know?3. Khalil arrived home from school with a grin. He burst through the front door and ran into the living room where he saw boxes wrapped in shiny paper and balloons tied to a chair. On the counter sat a chocolate cake with eleven candles. He reached for a taste of the frosting, but his mother scolded, "We have to sing to you before eating the cake!" What is Khalil celebrating? How do you know?4. It was dawn when Pepito heard the sound of a rooster crowing. That was his signal that it was time to get up. He quickly dressed and, on his way out the door, he pulled on a pair of muddy boots. Outside the smell of sweet hay filled the air. He whistled as he sprinkled handfuls of grain and corn across the dewy ground. Then, he grabbed an empty bucket and smiled to himself as he thought about the fresh milk that would soon fill it.Where does Pepito live? How do you know?5. Gabbi grinned as she looked into the mirror. Her face was smeared with paint and she couldn't be happier. She pulled on her black dress and pointy black hat. As a final touch, she tucked a few wispy spider webs into her hair. Finally, she was ready. She grabbed her orange bag and headed out into the night. As she disappeared into the darkness, she heard her mom yell, "Don't eat too much candy tonight!" What day is it? How do you know?​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. Meredith is Taylor's pet dog. She is a dog because of the several verbs in the paragraph that state what domestic dogs do such as to sniff, and to waggle her tail.</p><p>2. Brendon has been from the grocery because from the paragraph, it says that he was carrying four paper bags on his way home and that some of the items that fell are oranges, a loaf of bread, and the two sticks of butter, which are things that can be bought from that place.</p><p>3. Khalil is celebrating his birthday because the paragraph stated some things found on a birthday party like a cake with candles, shiny presents, and balloons. Furthermore, the statement of the mother to sing for him before eating the cake was mentioned which is a custom on every birthday.</p><p>4. Pepito lives in a farm because from the paragraph, it says that he wakes up at the sound of the crowing rooster, he wears muddy boots, sprinkled handfuls of grain and corn across the dewy ground, and that he milks a cow, which is the work of a farmer like him.</p><p>5. It was Halloween. From the paragraph, Gabbi wore a witch's costume which is a black dress a pointy black hat, and a few wispy spider webs into her hair. Furthermore, she went trick-or-treating that's why the paragraph stated that she got her orange bag to got do that activity and she must have collected tons of candy because from what her mom yelled, "Don't eat too much candy tonight!", it's clear to see that she is excited to eat the candies that she had worked hard trick-or-treating for.</p><p></p><br />

                            15. Direction: Read each paragraph carefully then identify its text structure. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. 1. My neighbor, Mr. Clark, just bought a new car. It is a beautiful, 2008, black Mercedes. He chose gray leather interior and the seats are even heated for those cold, Kansas winters. He washes it every weekened, so that it always looks shiny. 2. One of my favorite things to eat in the summer time is tomatoes. Because they are so expensive at the store, I decided to grow my own tomatoes last summer. Unfortunately, the plants didn't produce many tomatoes. One day, I thought I had better look at the plants carefully to see what the problem might be. Sure enough, I found little white bugs all over the leaves. 3. Holly and Molly are identical twins. Although they look exactly alike, everything else about them is different. Holly likes to play sports and enjoys listening to rock and hip-hop music. Molly would much rather read and play classical music on the piano with her free time. They dress differently, too. Holly likes to wear casual clothes, but Molly prefers to dress up every day. Even though they lead very different lives, Holly and Molly love each other very much and enjoy discussing their day every night. 4. Last night, I made chocolate chip cookies. First, I pre-heated the oven to 375°C. Then, I blended butter, brown sugar, and an egg together. After that I stirred in flour, salt and baking soda, Next, I stirred in chocolate chips. Finally, I dropped them by the spoonful on a baking sheet. After twelve minutes. At last, we ate! Yum, yum! 5. Mark was very upset.
