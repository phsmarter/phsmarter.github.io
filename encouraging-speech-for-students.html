Criminology is the scientific study of crime, criminals, and the criminal justice system, and it plays a crucial role in ensuring that our communities are safe and secure. </p><p></p><p>As senior high school students, you are at a crucial point in your lives where you are starting to think about your future careers. I want to encourage you to consider criminology as a field of study, and a potential career path.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, studying criminology can be intellectually stimulating and challenging. It involves examining and analyzing complex issues related to crime, law, and social justice. You will learn about the psychology of criminal behavior, the workings of the justice system, and the impact of crime on society.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, criminology is a field that provides a wide range of career opportunities. You can work in law enforcement, the courts, corrections, or in various government agencies. You can also pursue careers in research, policy analysis, or advocacy work.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, criminology is a field that is constantly evolving, and new developments and challenges arise all the time. This means that there will always be opportunities for growth and learning throughout your career.</p><p></p><p>Finally, as a criminology student and potential future professional, you will have the opportunity to make a real difference in people's lives. You will be contributing to the important work of creating a safer and more just society for everyone.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, criminology is an exciting and rewarding field of study that offers a wide range of opportunities for personal and professional growth. I encourage you to consider becoming a criminology student and to explore the many opportunities that this field has to offer. Thank you for listening.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As parents, our natural instinct is to shield our kids from all potential pitfalls. But carefully letting your kids learn a hard lesson from their own mistakes and then talking to them about it after the fact will give them great insight.</p><p></p><p>One of the greatest gifts you can give your child is to teach them how to handle money properly. If you can teach your child to handle money in a responsible manner, most likely that will follow through into the other parts of his life. An ancient proverb says, “Of what use is money in the hand of a fool, since he has no desire to get wisdom?”</p><p></p><p>If you yourself do not follow these principles, then how do you expect your child to want to? “Do as I say, not as I do” is NOT a good conversation starter with a child. If need be, use your own faults as an example of how not to be and promise to do better. Humbling yourself in front of your child and admitting your weakness will actually make him feel closer to you. Where you do have strengths in decision-making skills, teach those to him. The best lessons in life are caught, not taught, by a child’s parents.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Hope it helps ☺️<br />

As we know, choosing a career path is a crucial decision that we all have to make in our lives. And for senior high school students, this decision is even more critical as it will determine their future.</p><p></p><p>One field that I want to encourage senior high school students to consider is criminology. Criminology is a fascinating field of study that focuses on the science of crime, criminal behavior, and society's response to crime. It involves understanding the causes and consequences of criminal behavior and developing strategies to prevent and control it.</p><p></p><p>Now, you may be wondering why I am advocating for this field. The answer is simple: Criminology offers a vast range of career opportunities, from law enforcement and criminal investigation to forensic science and research. If you are someone who is interested in making a difference in your community and working towards justice, criminology might be the perfect career for you.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the skills you will gain in criminology are highly valued in many other fields as well, such as law, social work, and psychology. These skills include critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and interpersonal skills, which are all essential in any career path.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, senior high school students, I encourage you to consider criminology as a potential career path. Not only is it a fascinating field, but it also offers many opportunities to make a positive impact in society. Remember, it's never too early to start thinking about your future and exploring the many options available to you.

                        <p>A SPEECH OF ENCOURAGING THE YOUTH TO BE<strong> "MAKERS OF COMMUNICATION":</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen.</p><p></p><p>With all my respect, to the committees that give me a chance to deliver my speech. And all my beloved friends. First, let's us give thanks to God who has given grace and health for all of us so that we can meet in this lovely room. My speech is discussed about <strong>“YOUTH AS THE MAKERS OF COMMUNICATION”.</strong></p><p></p><p>Whether it's at home, on campus, or in the world of work, most of the youth may often not dare <strong>to express an opinion or the maker of communication</strong>. Classic reasons such as fear of saying the wrong thing may be something that crosses the minds of youths. In fact, there is nothing wrong or right in expressing an opinion, as a result you just follow other people's opinions or just follow the flow of the conversation.</p><p></p><p>There are several factors why someone is difficult to speak up. One of them may be because there are too many ideas and feel nervous that it is difficult to express them. But, there are times when you have to be brave to show your aspirations, because a small input or suggestion can be a big change, you know.</p><p></p><p>Some of the reasons you should be makers of communication are the first so that <strong>you are not easily underestimated. </strong>You are a good worker, diligent, and have good achievements, but, often you feel belittled not because of your skills, but because you are shy or don't dare to have an opinion. Usually, you will tend to be taken advantage of by them, and assumptions such as 'he just does the work, he always wants to, really'. If you wait for people to be concerned about you, or feel compassion, you may be mentally disturbed. So, collect the belief that you have in yourself and communicate with those around you what you feel is weighing on you at that time.</p><p></p><p>Second, <strong>reduce misunderstandings.</strong> The main cause of misunderstandings, usually occurs when there is a failure in communication and at any time. Lack of communication, can make other people think badly of us. Therefore, it is important to have the courage to speak up, because this effort can help your friends or people around you to understand your intentions and vice versa. Not a bad thing, right?</p><p></p><p>Third, you should <strong>know that silence doesn't change anything.</strong> Although there is a saying that says silence is gold, but you continue to be a quiet person, maybe people around you will be shy with you. For example, you are discussing with a friend, and you do not agree but prefer to remain silent. Of course nothing will change. It's better to be open with your friends, or relatives who dare to express their opinions. Rest assured, there is no right or wrong because everyone has a different mindset. So, don't be afraid of it, okay?</p><p></p><p>That's my speech today. So that youth can understand their role as agents of change, especially as makers or communication.</p><p></p><p>That's all, thank you very much.</p><p></p><p>See more about sample sentences of direct speech and the corresponding sentences in reported speech:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/19914423</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>These days there are a lot of discussions over education in many colleges and universities. One of the matters under consideration is whether grades encourage students to learn. Some people think that students are not encouraged to learn by grades. From my point of view, I believe that marks actually stimulate students to study for the three following reasons: First of all, grade obviously is a good way to estimate students.</p><p>This will help heighten their job and promotion opportunities after graduating form those universities especially in today’s ompetitive labor market. For this reason, students always try to get high grades to gain a lot of advantages in their lives. In short, grade actually encourages students to learn much more simply because students are not only evaluated by grades, but also know clearly their strong and weak points.</p><p>Today, in order to catch up with the rapid development of society, there are many changes taken place in educational system. Some people think that they may need a different solution to evaluate students’ level in class instead of traditional giving marks. However, in my opinion, I still believe that marks are a credible standard that encourages students to learn better for following reasons.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope this helps you. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>“At the end of the day all we need is hope and strength. Hope that it will eventually get better and strength to hold on till it does”. And while we are waiting; whatever hardship, challenges, indecisions and fears that we are facing, we just remember that these too shall pass and by the grace of God we will overcome. To our students we hope that they continue to trust us that what we do today will define what kind of health professionals they will all be in the future. We promise that excellence will still be part of everything that we do for them and our community. Just remember that tomorrow is still full of wonderful possibilities </p><p></p><p>My fellow students, do you still remember before the pandemic? We all persevered in learning before, when we were given a project by the teacher, we did it effortlessly, we did everything before, even if we didn’t have the gadgets needed to study, we did everything to pass a subject, and to increase our grades. </p><p>But when the pandemic came, we all struggled, we all adjusted, but is this the reason why we don’t study well? Since we are no longer directly in front of the teacher and we are all in virtual learning using applications on our gadget, will this prevent us from studying well? Of course not. </p><p>We still need to study hard despite this pandemic. Let us not let the pandemic hinder our learning. In fact, there are disadvantages and advantages that the pandemic has made in our study. For example, we are no longer face-to-face in learning today, everyone is virtually learning.
</p><p>Because we study at home today, we know that there are also many distractions sometimes, but despite this, there are also advantages.
</p><p>For example, we have plenty of time to study our lessons. What else? Since we are all required to use gadgets, we will no longer have difficulty learning. Just one click on the internet and there is the answer to our questions. We need to study well even more, because it will help us to recover, despite this pandemic.</p><br />
