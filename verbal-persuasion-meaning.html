What is It In this module, you will learn the Basic Factors of Delivery but before that, let's discuss first what are the Methods of Speech Delivery. It is very important that you know all of these because these are the bases of the activities that you are going to perform. Speech delivery is an important part of public speaking. No matter how inspiring, informative or persuasive the speech you have written, poor delivery will leave your audience as if nothing happens, and your presentation will simply be forgettable. There are some individuals who are capable enough to deliver speech effectively in public while others need to be coached and directed to deliver speeches more articulately and memorably. It takes time to become a professional speaker but with the help of the following practical speech delivery tips, it will certainly help you on your way to becoming a more effective and dynamic speaker. Delivery refers to the presentation of the speech you studied, planned, described, and practiced in the form of public speaking. It is relevant because it is the most important for the audience. It relies on both verbal communication and nonverbal communication. Verbal communication is about language, both written and spoken. In general, verbal communication refers to our use of words while nonverbal communication refers to communication that occurs through means other than words, such as body language, gestures, and silence. Both verbal and nonverbal communication can be spoken and written.​</a>

I'm [insert your name here] and I'll be your host for tonight's broadcast.</p><p></p><p>[Provide some background information]</p><p></p><p>The Red Phoenix are currently sitting at the top of the league with an impressive record of 8-1.

The Red Phoenix were able to hold off the Blue Sharks and secure the win with a final score of 25-23.

What is It In this module, you will learn the Basic Factors of Delivery but before that, let's discuss first what are the Methods of Speech Delivery. It is very important that you know all of these because these are the bases of the activities that you are going to perform. Speech delivery is an important part of public speaking. No matter how inspiring, informative or persuasive the speech you have written, poor delivery will leave your audience as if nothing happens, and your presentation will simply be forgettable. There are some individuals who are capable enough to deliver speech effectively in public while others need to be coached and directed to deliver speeches more articulately and memorably. It takes time to become a professional speaker but with the help of the following practical speech delivery tips, it will certainly help you on your way to becoming a more effective and dynamic speaker. Delivery refers to the presentation of the speech you studied, planned, described, and practiced in the form of public speaking. It is relevant because it is the most important for the audience. It relies on both verbal communication and nonverbal communication. Verbal communication is about language, both written and spoken. In general, verbal communication refers to our use of words while nonverbal communication refers to communication that occurs through means other than words, such as body language, gestures, and silence. Both verbal and nonverbal communication can be spoken and written.​</h2><br />
