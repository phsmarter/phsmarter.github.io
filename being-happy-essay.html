Dear Teacher (YOUR TEACHER'S NAME), 
Thank you for being an excellent teacher. I know that teachers like you are not that easy to find. Everyday you came to school with a big smile on your face and a kind word for all of us. Your love of learning ignited our curiosity and made learning much more interesting. You taught us to think with a clear mind and write with clarity. I'll never forget those essays you made us write in class. Well yeah, I wasn't exactly 'That happy' with you for giving me much work. But today, I learned the value of all that work. Thank you for teaching us and bringing us closer to Jesus and God. I/We wouldn't be here today without you. With all sincerity, Y/N (Your Name).</a>

However, it is important to remember that your schooling, no matter how long it may feel, lasts for just a few short years compared to the rest of your life ahead of you. Therefore, it is better to sacrifice a little bit of fun now so that you can find happiness in later life, as you will be happier if you can do a job that you enjoy and afford to do the things you want.

Making and Keeping Friends 
Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other's happiness and supporting each other when times are tough.
A lot of friends have things in common so it's easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can Per even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. 
Showing you care about the other person's happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends' faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. 
Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don't know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it's uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it's nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that's when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. 
Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care

                        <p>The statement above implies that man is here for the sake of other men and for the countless unknown souls. The statement is often said in a context of a man's life that he is always remembering other people and the souls. The statement also implies a social responsibility and the ability to value for other people's feelings that are just like yourself.</p><p>Man is always aware of other people's life. People may not have common beliefs, but the common bond they share with each other is their life. The same thing that keeps people awake at night is what keeps others happy in the morning. It is the same feeling that keeps people go through another day as well as it is the same feeling that makes others smile every night. The life is a cycle of emotion and people understand the cycle and this is something they should share.</p><p>Each person has that personal life that they should keep and must keep to themselves. Though, it should be extended to others as well. The happiness and the sadness that they feel should be understood by the others. Life must be shared and people should understand the happiness they give to other people.</p><p>The statement of Albert Einstein falls in the part where he talks about the happiness of others. The happiness of others is a part of your life as well. Life is a social phenomenon and everyone should be happy. The lives of others are as important as the lives you live and you have to understand that. </p><br />

Making and Keeping Friends 
Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other's happiness and supporting each other when times are tough.
A lot of friends have things in common so it's easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can Per even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. 
Showing you care about the other person's happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends' faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. 
Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don't know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it's uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it's nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that's when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. 
Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care
