Because these creatures are active all year, they decompose materials on the <strong>forest</strong> floor swiftly. In other biomes, such as the deciduous forest, leaf litter decomposition contributes nutrients to the soil. Plants in the tropical rain<strong>forest</strong>, on the other hand, grow so quickly that they quickly eat the nutrients from decomposing leaf litter. As a result, the majority of nutrients are found in trees in the <strong>forest</strong> and other plants rather than in the soil. The majority of nutrients taken into the soil in the <strong>forest</strong> are leached out by the plentiful rains, leaving the soil barren and acidic.</p><p></p><p>What are the beneficial interactions of tropical rainforests?</p><p>brainly.ph/question/11957211</p><p></p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />
