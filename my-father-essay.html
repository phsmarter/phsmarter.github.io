Currently, I am just beginning my journey and I am ready to take the undergraduate studies program. My ultimate goal is to finish Bachelor in Public Affaits (BPA) at Silliman University. Once I have completed my undergraduate course, I intend to pursue further studies in the same field, so I can be fully equipped for public service and governance. I am sure this is the correct career path as I grew up in a family where my father was a city councilor and my mother was a social worker. Both of my parents are graduates of Silliman University and I have seen how dedicated they have been to serving people. My goal therefore is to become a passionate public servant like my parents, and I believe that Silliman University School of Public Affairs can adequately prepare me for my chosen career. I have attached my transcript of records, application essay, letters of recommendation and other pertinent documents. Thank you for your time. and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely, MEGAN REYES Answer the following questions based on the sample collegeadmission letter.1. What is the school's complete name?  2.

                            2. my father goes to court essayintroduction,body and conclusion​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The story is set in a city in the Philippines. The young narrator begins by describing his large family. Though they are poor they are full of mischief and laughter. The children are all strong and healthy even though they often go hungry. In contrast, their rich neighbor’s children are thin and sickly although they are given plenty of good food, which their impoverished neighbors enjoy smelling over the fence. Consequently, the rich man brings a charge against the narrator’s family for stealing the spirit of his family’s food.</strong></p><p><strong>The absurd case goes to court, and the narrator’s father agrees to pay back the rich neighbor. He does this by collecting coins from all his friends present in his hat, then shaking the hat full of coins. Being charged to pay for the spirit of food which his family supposedly got from its smell, he maintains that the jingling of the coins is a fair equivalent.</strong></p><p><strong>The judge rules in the poor father’s favor, and the rich man is forced to depart with no other payment than the “spirit” of the money the poor man collected. In the Filipino context, this story favors the underprivileged families over affluent ones. It is</strong></p><p><strong>supported by the part at the end of the story where after the father gave back the “spirit of wealth” through the jingling of the coins in the straw hat, the judge immediately dismissed the case. While it is not really true in this day and age because the poor has no fair fight against the rich, the idea behind it is not quite simple. Maybe the author wanted to show the issue the other way around, thus, using a reverse psychology.</strong></p><p><strong>Filipinos are known to be light people. We don’t usually wear much burden on our shoulders. Well, we have a lot but how do we cope with every situation? By not taking it so hard, of course! In every problem, like poverty, even if they don’t get to eat much for the day, they are still smiling and laughing together and the family is still intact. Like in the story, the narrator’s family is a poor family, and yet, because they are not so sensitive, they get to play outside and laugh. In the rich family’s case, they are abundant in food and a comfortable lifestyle but are still not content with what they have and push others-like the poor family- to pay for it. In the real world, rich people tend to step down on the poor because they perceive themselves more powerful than the poor.</strong></p><p><strong>In the part where the judge asked the father where his lawyer was, and he said he doesn’t need one, it is seen as the turning point of justice in the Philippines. The law dictates that every citizen is given justice. But is it really the case? The law takes for granted the poor.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>please pic all</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>half yung kilid</p><p>"My Father Goes to Court" by Carlos Bulosan is a literary masterpiece that perfectly captures the struggles of the Filipino people during a time of colonization and oppression. The story, which is presented in a simple but effective narrative, follows the protagonist, a young boy, as he accompanies his father to court after he has been falsely accused of stealing.</p><p></p><p>One of the main themes in the story is the injustice that is prevalent in Filipino society. Bulosan portrays this theme through the character of the father, who is a victim of false accusations and the corrupt justice system. The father is an honest and hardworking man who has devoted his life to supporting his family. However, his honesty and hard work are not enough to protect him from the false accusations of those who seek to bring him down.</p><p></p><p>Bulosan also touches on the theme of family and the strong bonds that exist between parents and children. The protagonist's relationship with his father is one of admiration and respect, and this is evident throughout the story. Despite all the troubles that they face, the protagonist remains loyal to his father and supports him in his time of need.</p><p></p><p>The story also highlights the struggles of immigrants and their journey to adapt to a new way of life. The father, a migrant worker, is faced with the challenge of adapting to a new culture and way of life. He is also subjected to discrimination and prejudice due to his status as an immigrant. However, despite these challenges, he remains determined to provide for his family and make a life for himself in his new home.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, "My Father Goes to Court" is a poignant and powerful story that touches on a range of themes and issues that are still relevant to contemporary society. Through his use of simple yet effective prose, Bulosan manages to capture the struggles and triumphs of the Filipino people during a time of political and social upheaval. This makes the story a timeless piece of literature that can still resonate with readers today.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>"My Father Goes to Court" is a short story written by Carlos Bulosan, which is often studied as a piece of literature in English classes. It is not a conviction and belief essay in itself, but it does explore themes related to justice, prejudice, and personal conviction.</p><p></p><p>The story centers around the character of the narrator's father, who is a poor Filipino immigrant working in the United States. One day, the father is accused of stealing and is brought to court. Despite facing discrimination and injustice, the father maintains his innocence and stands up for himself in court, even if it means facing punishment.</p><p></p><p>Through the father's character, the story explores themes related to conviction and belief, particularly the idea of standing up for oneself and one's beliefs in the face of adversity. It also touches on themes related to cultural identity and the struggles faced by immigrants in the United States.</p><p></p><p>While "My Father Goes to Court" is not a conviction and belief essay in itself, it does offer a powerful example of how personal conviction and belief can influence one's actions and shape one's identity.</p><br />
