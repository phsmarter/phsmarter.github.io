Here is the perfect system for cleaning your room. First, move all of the items that comhave a proper place to the center of the room. Get rid of at least five things that you have not used witthe last year. Take out all of the trash, and place all of the dirty dishes in the kitchen sind Neu find alocation for each of the items you had placed in the center of the room. For any remaining items, see youcan squeeze them in under your bed or stuff them into the back of your doset See, that was easy!2. Oceans and lakes have much in common, but they are also quite different. Both are bodiesof water, but oceans are very large bodies of salt water, while lakes are much smaller bodies of freshwater. Lakes are usually surrounded by land, while oceans are what surround continents. Both have plantsand animals living in them. The ocean is home to the largest animals on the planet, whereas lakes supportmuch smaller forms of life. When it is time for a vacation, both will make a great place to visit and enjoy3. I haven't been to Bali, Indonesia, but I have read about it. I have been to Boracay Island,that's why I know these two tourist destinations are similar in many ways. Both are small islands that havefive beachers, hillside terraces and cool green hills. Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisinesbecausepeople from all over the world visit them. However, Bali's beaches are golden while those of Boracay arewhite and the sand is fine as powder. A village in bali is famous for its golden and silver work. There is noneof this in Boracay. There is a cultural center in Bali called Ubud. On the other hand, there are only shopswhere you can buy goods that are very Filipino in Boracay.4. I do well in school, and people think I am smart because of it. But it's not true. In fact, threeyears ago I struggled in school. However, two years ago I decided to get serious about school and made afew changes. First, I decided I would become interested in whatever was being taught, regardless of whatother people thought. I also decided I would work hard every day and never give up on any assignment. 1decided to never, never fall behind. Finally, I decided to make school a priority over friends and fun. Afterimplementing these changes, I became an active participant in classroom discussions. Then my test scoresbegan to rise. I still remember the first time that someone made fun of me because "I was smart." Howexciting! It seems to me that being smart is simply a matter of working hard and being interested. After all,learning a new video game is hard work even when you are interested. Unfortunately, learning a new videogame doesn't help you get into college or get a good job.5. More and more children in the neighbourhood were becoming sick of respiratory diseases, so thebarangay officials planned out some action. The entry of vehicles was limited, so that fumes exhausted would belessened. Since smoking cigarettes harms the health of children, smokers in families were advised not to. Families,too, were told to use water-based paints, odourless detergents, unscented soap, and other mild cleaning agents so​</a>

They are both grade six pupils and study in Pitpitan Elementary School located at Pitpitan, Bulakan, Bulacan. This place is very strict when it comes to safety protocols like wearing face mask and face shield, social distancing and not allowing minors to go out in their house. It is to ensure that the residents here are protected from COVID-19. 14 One morning, Isabel saw Karen leaving their house. “Karen, where are you going?” asked Isabel. “I will go to school and get my modules,” answered Karen. Isabel told her that children like them are not allowed to go out in the house especially going to school to get the module, but Karen ignored her. A barangay official saw her. Then the following day, the whole barangay was reminded about not allowing minors to go out their house. a. Be a good friend to others. b. Follow and obey safety protocols.

3. Isabel and Karen are neighbors and at the same time are friends. They are both grade six pupils and study in Pitpitan Elementary School located at Pitpitan, Bulakan, Bulacan. This place is very strict when it comes to safety protocols like wearing face mask and face shield, social distancing and not allowing minors to go out in their house. It is to ensure that the residents here are protected from COVID-19. 14

Isabel told her that children like them are not allowed to go out in the house especially going to school to get the module, but Karen ignored her. A barangay official saw her. Then the following day, the whole barangay was reminded about not allowing minors to go out their house.
