Not just the ones we have when we close our eyes at night, but the ones we hold close to our hearts and hope to achieve someday.</p><p></p><p>Dreams are the fuel that keeps us going. They give us something to strive for, something to look forward to. They are what keep us from becoming complacent and settling for less than we deserve.</p><p></p><p>But dreams can also be intimidating. The path to achieving them may not be easy, and we may face obstacles and setbacks along the way. However, it is important to remember that the journey is just as important as the destination.</p><p></p><p>It is through the pursuit of our dreams that we learn the most about ourselves, our strengths, and our weaknesses. We discover what we are capable of and what we truly value in life.</p><p></p><p>So, I encourage all of you to hold on to your dreams, no matter how big or small they may be. Use them as motivation to push yourself to new heights and achieve things you never thought possible.</p><p></p><p>Remember, the only limit to what we can achieve is the limit we set for ourselves. So, dream big, work hard, and never give up on yourself.</p><p></p><p>Thank you.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Sometimes people incline to dream and live a fictional life. This may be to ignore the struggles and difficulties that they have to come across in life.

These kinds of dreams are very important to achieve success and fame.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Dreaming is a kind of mental activity, which is different from waking thought that happens during sleep.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, and fellow dreamers, good day to all of you. Today, I want to talk about a topic that's very dear to me, and that is dreams.</p><p></p><p>We all have dreams, aspirations, and goals that we want to achieve. Some of us want to be successful entrepreneurs, while others want to travel the world, become professional athletes, or pursue a career in the arts. Whatever our dreams are, they provide us with a sense of purpose, direction, and motivation.</p><p></p><p>But why do we dream? What is the significance of our dreams? Dreams are more than just fleeting thoughts or fantasies. They are the manifestation of our deepest desires, hopes, and values. Dreams give us something to strive for, to work towards, and to become.</p><p></p><p>However, dreams don't come easy. They require hard work, dedication, and sacrifice. Achieving our dreams often involves overcoming obstacles, facing setbacks, and persevering through tough times. But the rewards of realizing our dreams are immeasurable. They provide us with a sense of fulfillment, happiness, and satisfaction that no material possessions can match.</p><p></p><p>It's important to remember that dreams are not just for the young or the privileged. Regardless of our age, background, or circumstances, we all have the potential to dream big and achieve great things. Our dreams are what make us unique, what give us our identity, and what inspire us to be our best selves.</p><p></p><p>So how do we make our dreams a reality? First, we need to have a clear vision of what we want to achieve. We need to set realistic goals, create a plan of action, and take small steps towards our dreams every day. We also need to stay focused, motivated, and disciplined, and not let setbacks or failures deter us from our path.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, we need to surround ourselves with positive, supportive, and like-minded individuals who believe in us and our dreams. We need to seek out mentors, role models, and allies who can guide us, inspire us, and provide us with the resources and opportunities to achieve our dreams.</p><p></p><p>Finally, we need to cultivate a mindset of perseverance, resilience, and optimism. We need to believe in ourselves, trust the process, and stay committed to our dreams, even in the face of adversity.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, dreaming is an essential part of the human experience. It is what drives us, inspires us, and empowers us to become the best versions of ourselves. So I urge you all to dream big, work hard, and never give up on your dreams. For as Walt Disney once said, "All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them." Thank you.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This may be less than 5 minutes long, but I hope it helps.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Persuasive Speech about my Dream Career As A Chef</strong></p><p></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am here to share with you my dream career as a chef. Ever since I was a child, I found solace in the kitchen, watching my mother cook up a storm for our family. As I grew older, I began to realize that cooking was not just a means to satiate our hunger but an art form that required passion, precision, and creativity.</p><p></p><p>As I delved deeper into the world of culinary arts, I realized that being a chef meant more than just cooking delicious meals.

They are the ones who keep us going in times when we want to give up. When we fail at something, we need to remind ourselves to keep going because we have dreams to chase. But it's hard isn't it? Chasing and falling then getting up, and falling again. But that's how it's supposed to work. Working tirelessly until it feels like a never ending cycle of breaking and being fixed again. And it's ok to feel that way, to feel that you're tired and helpless; but always remind yourself, although feeling like you're at your worst, you must NEVER give up. Yes you've fell before but you got back up again! You got back up because you are determined and you're strong! If giving up ever crosses your mind, think about how far you've already gone. Think about how much you've sacrificed just to reach your goals. And most importantly, Think about yourself. Trust me, all that pain will be very much worth it in the end once you get the taste of success. Always remember, working tirelessly is hard but carrying the burden of your regrets in the future will be harder! <br />Never stop chasing! Never stop getting back on track! Never stop believing in yourself! Never stop dreaming, and by then, I'm sure, that you'll never stop growing as a dreamer!</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Whew that's a lot. You can edit the paragraph if you want though. I hope you at least give this a like or click the brainliest button! That would really help me a lot. Good luck in school!</p><br />

( With Connection And YOUR OWN SPEECH ONLY)</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,

</p><p>I stand before you today to talk about my dream job as a Chef. Growing up, I was always fascinated by the idea of creating new dishes, exploring unique ingredients, and experimenting with flavors. The joy of seeing people relish the food that I had carefully prepared was unmatched. It is this passion and love for food that has driven me to pursue a career as a Chef.

</p><p>The role of a Chef is not just about cooking food, it is about creating an entire experience for the diner. It requires not just culinary knowledge and skills, but also an artistic flair that can turn an ordinary meal into a work of art. As a Chef, I would have the opportunity to work with a plethora of ingredients, textures, and techniques - combining them to create beautiful and delicious dishes that would tantalize the senses.

</p><p>My dream job as a Chef would allow me to work in a dynamic and fast-paced environment, where every day is different and unique. It would require hard work, dedication, and attention to detail, but the satisfaction that comes from seeing the smiles on people's faces would make it all worth it. I would also get to work alongside some of the most creative and talented individuals in the industry, constantly learning and growing as a professional.

</p><p>But beyond just the technical aspects of the job, being a Chef would allow me to make a difference in people's lives. Food brings people together, and it is an essential part of our culture and traditions. As a Chef, I would have the ability to create meals that bring joy, comfort, and happiness to those around me. Whether it is through a formal dining experience or a casual gathering of friends and family, food has the power to connect us all.

</p><p>In conclusion, being a Chef is not just a job, it is a passion - a passion for creating culinary experiences that bring people together and celebrate the joys of life. My dream job as a Chef would not only allow me to pursue my love for food, but also make a positive impact in the world around me. I am committed to working hard, honing my skills, and fulfilling my dream of becoming a Chef. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Ladies and gentlemen</strong></p><p>I'm here to tell you about my ideal profession as a chef and why it's the most rewarding career path I could possibly imagine.</p><p></p><p>My passion has always been cooking. I enjoy trying new recipes, discovering new tastes, and making dishes that not only taste great but also look great. Being a chef allows me to turn my passion into a career, and there is nothing more fulfilling than earning a living doing what you enjoy.</p><p></p><p>As a chef, I am able to deal with a wide range of ingredients and cooking techniques, and I am always learning and growing in my art. Every day is a new challenge, and each dish is a fresh chance to demonstrate my originality and talent.</p><p></p><p>But being a chef entails more than just cooking. It's all about giving your guests an experience, taking them on a culinary journey that delights their senses and leaves them with memories they'll never forget. Seeing someone's delight as they taste a dish I've produced is what genuinely motivates me as a cook.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, becoming a chef entails working as part of a team. Teamwork is vital in the kitchen for the success of any business. Working with other chefs, sous chefs, and line cooks necessitates good communication, teamwork, and a shared passion for producing outstanding food.</p><p></p><p>But above all, being a chef means having the power to bring people together through food. Food has a unique ability to bridge cultural differences and create connections between people. As a chef, I have the opportunity to celebrate diversity through the dishes I create, and to foster a sense of community and togetherness around the table.</p><p>To summarize, being a chef is more than a job for me; it's a calling. It's a chance to transform my love of cooking into a rewarding career that allows me to constantly learn and improve, to create amazing experiences for my visitors, to work as part of a team, and to bring people together through food. I am delighted to embark on this path as a chef because I feel that through hard work, dedication, and a relentless pursuit of quality, I can make a real contribution in the culinary industry.</p><p><strong>Explanation</strong></p><p><strong>hope it helps</strong></p><br />

As a doctor, I will have the opportunity to make a real difference in people's lives, and that is something that truly inspires me.</p><p></p><p>But my dream of becoming a doctor is not just about personal fulfillment. It is also about giving back to society. The world needs more doctors, particularly in underserved communities where people don't have access to quality healthcare. By becoming a doctor, I will be able to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in people's lives and help to reduce health disparities.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, medicine is a constantly evolving field, and there are always new discoveries and treatments being developed. As a doctor, I will have the opportunity to be at the forefront of medical innovation, and to contribute to the advancement of healthcare for future generations.</p><p></p><p>I understand that becoming a doctor is a challenging and demanding career path, requiring years of hard work, dedication, and sacrifice. But I am willing to put in the effort, because I believe that the rewards of this profession are immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, my dream career as a doctor is not just about personal ambition, it is about making a difference in the world. I believe that this profession offers me the opportunity to use my talents and skills to serve others, and to contribute to the betterment of society. I am committed to pursuing this dream, and I hope that you will support me in my journey. Thank you.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.There are a myriad of thoughts going through my head when I deliver a speech.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious of course being the next line that I need to deliver. Taking that to a bigger picture I need to think about where the next line is in perspective to the overall story. Sometimes I need to divert from my script to provide clarity for the audience on an element of the speech or to answer an urgent question. The challenge can be to get back to my original story.</p><p></p><p>2.Control your voice. Show enough emotion to keep your audience's attention, but maintain control as well. Don't speak too loud, but speak loud enough so that your audience can hear you. When you first begin your speech, you may want to ask the audience if the sound is appropriate before you really get started.</p><p></p><br />
