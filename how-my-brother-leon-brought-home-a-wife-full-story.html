                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Leon and his wife Maria are about to return to Leon’s village after getting married. They had met in the city and Maria has never lived in a village. They are greeted by Baldo, Leon’s younger sibling, as their horse carriage stops outside the village.</p><p></p><p>Baldo welcomes the new member of the family. He is impressed by her beauty and soft feature. He observes her nice fragrance and radiant smile. He ties their bull, named Labang, to the cart and Leon hauls their trunk on it.</p><p></p><p>Baldo encourages Maria to touch Labang’s hair and horns. She is awestruck at Labang’s strength and horns. Leon helps her on the cart and she sits on a bale of husk. They start their journey and Leon has the reins.</p><p></p><p>After going a little further, Baldo takes the reins and takes a sudden route change into the rocky road of Waig and surrounding fields. Leon enquiries about the change of route and Baldo assure him that he is only following their father’s orders.</p><p></p><p>Baldo and Leon both question Maria about her views about their village, fields and rocky roads. She is enthralled by the natural beauty and simple lifestyle. She condemns the sheer number of vehicles and noise in the city.</p><p></p><p>She loves the starry and clear skies over the lush fields. She and Leon even start to sing a song that Leon was taught by his father about the sowed fields under clear skies. They meet a couple of people after coming out of the fields but not many as most people avoid using the fields after dark.</p><p></p><p>They finally reach their house and are welcomed by Leon’s mother and sister. They are smiling and excited. Leon enquiries about his father who is in his room struggling with leg pain (injured in the revolution).</p><p></p><p>Baldo goes to tie Labang and when he returns he finds Maria talking and crying with his mother and sister. His hears his father’s call and goes to meet him.</p><p></p><p>His father questions about Maria’s conduct and her behaviour throughout their journey to the house. It was test designed to see if she can adjust and accept the life of the village and make it her home.</p><p></p><p>Baldo reassures him about her live for Leon and commitment to their marriage. He confirms his observation that Maria was ready to embrace their house as her home.</p><p></p><p>Their conversation is disturbed as the new couple enters to meet with the father. Baldo leaves the room giving them some space with the head of the family.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Baldo was able to meet his brother’s wife Maria, As Baldo saw his older brother's wife, he described her as lovely, tall, and beautiful. Upon their journey to leon’s home, leon is wondering why baldo drove them to the waig instead of the camino real, baldo answered that he drove the waig because their father told him to do so. The waig route will serve as test to Maria if she can live in the province which differs a lot from the city where she lived in, but then it seems like maria likes leons province, she described this as beautiful, fresh air, clean, and free of dust. During their journey, maria, was worried if leons father and family would like her. When they arrived home, father talked to baldo asking what happened during their travel, the father asked Baldo if Maria was afraid in their place, Baldo answered that Maria was not afraid and instead she enjoyed the journey.</p><p></p><br />

                            16. what is waig in the story of How my Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife</h2><br />
                        When I first read "How My Brother Leon Brought Home A Wife," I was in fourth grade. And just like any fourth grader, it didn't mean anything to me. Or perhaps it did, albeit in a very shallow, childish way. I remember thinking that Maria is a clever and sweet girl when she called Leon Noel. See, it's Leon spelled backwards! Oh, the simple satisfaction of a child's discovery.<br />Reading it again several years after, proved to be more than an eye-opener. The short story is not just a recollection of an afternoon adventure with a brother's fiancé. It's a plan made with good intentions, but was executed with apparent cruelty.<br />The short story opened with a simple but direct (and quite pictorial) description of Maria.She stepped down from the carretela of Ca Celin with a quick, delicate grace. She was lovely. She was tall. She looked up to my brother with a smile, and her forehead was on a level with his mouth. … Her nails were long, but they were not painted. She was fragrant like a morning when papayas are in bloom. And a small dimple appeared momently high on her right cheek.From here, all the other descriptions sprang from Maria. Baldo, Leon's younger brother, see things only as Maria's periphery. The narrative flow becomes based on whatever Maria looks at, touches, or whoever comes near Maria. She seems to be a beautiful light source, and any object only becomes relevant when touched by her radiance.<br />Baldo was the one tasked to bring Leon and Maria to their house. But instead of following camino real (which I believe was the main road), Baldo guided Labang (the carabao) the other way -- back to where Ca Celin dropped them off and into the fields.<br />This is where things get mysterious … and awkward.When I sent Labang down the deep cut that would take us to the dry bed of the Waig which could be used as a path to our place during the dry season, my brother Leon laid a hand on my shoulder and said sternly: "Who told you to drive through the fields tonight?" His hand was heavy on my shoulder, but I did not look at him or utter a word until we were on the rocky bottom of the Waig. "Baldo, you fool, answer me before I lay the rope of Labang on you. Why do you follow the Waig instead of the camino real?" His fingers bit into my shoulder. "Father, he told me to follow the Waig tonight, Manong." Swiftly, his hand fell away from my shoulder and he reached for the rope of Labang. Then my brother Leon laughed, and he sat back, and laughing still, he said: "And I suppose Father also told you to hitch Labang to the cart and meet us with him instead of with Castano and the calesa."What's admirable in Leon's personality is his calmness. He might have already sensed that something is awry, yet, just like most Filipinos, he chose to dwell on positive things.Without waiting for me to answer, he turned to her and said, "Maria, why do you think Father should do that, now?" He laughed and added, "Have you ever seen so many stars before?"And so they looked at the stars, and sang. They still sang even after the cart's wheels hit a big rock. And Baldo noticed that Leon and Maria's world is no doubt full of happiness.<br />After realizing that they are getting nearer Leon's home, Maria expressed her fear that his father may not like her.<br />Upon reaching their house, Leon immediately looked for his father. But it was Baldo for whom the old man called."Did you meet anybody on the way?" he asked. "No, Father," I said. "Nobody passes through the Waig at night." He reached for his roll of tobacco and hitched himself up in the chair. "She is very beautiful, Father." "Was she afraid of Labang?" My father had not raised his voice, but the room seemed to resound with it. And again I saw her eyes on the long curving horns and the arm of my brother Leon around her shoulders. "No, Father, she was not afraid." "On the way---" "She looked at the stars, Father. And Manong Leon sang." "What did he sing?" "---Sky Sown with Stars... She sang with him." He was silent again.When Leon and Maria entered the old man's room, Baldo was told to water Labang. And on his way out, he can’t help but notice Maria again.I looked at Maria and she was lovely. She was tall. Beside my brother Leon, she was tall and very still. Then I went out, and in the darkened hall the fragrance of her was like a morning when papayas are in bloom.The story started and ended in the description of the same person. It is easy to think that the story isn't about Leon. It is about Maria.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologize. What we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologize to the internet. I want to apologize to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But most importantly I want to apologize to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. I don’t deserve to be defended. The goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world I live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don’t expect to be forgiven, I’m just here to apologize. I'm ashamed of myself. I’m disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you.</p><p></p><br />
