                                            Think again about the story "Captured by Opechancanough."Note that the narrator tells about his travels. A travel account iscalled a journal. The journal of Captain John Smith-a recordof the perils and frustrations of America's first settlers-is oneof the first literature of America."Capture by Opechancanough"              An excerpt           By John SmithWith two Indians for my quides and two of our own company, I set out, leaving seven in the barge. Having explored twenty miles further in this desert, I found that the river still kept its depth and breadth, but that it was much more thickly lined with trees.Some twelve miles above the barge, we went ashore to refresh ourselves and to cook our food. One of the Indians 1 took with me to examine the nature of the soil and to cross the bends of the river. The other Indian I left with John Robinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches, light, and with the order that they should discharge a gun for my retreat, at the first sight of any Indian.Within a quarter of an hour, I heard a loud cry and the yelling of Indians, but no warning shot. Supposing my companions were surprised, and that the Indian guides had betrayed us, I seized my guide and found his arm fast to my hand with a garter, with my pistol aimed, ready to take revenge upon him. He advised me to fly and seemed ignorant of what was happening.But as he went on, I was struck with an arrow on the right thigh, without however, being seriously harmed. When this happened, I caught sight of two Indians drawing their bows. I prevented them from shooting by firing my French pistol.By the time I had loaded again, three or four more Indians were making ready to shoot. The first had fallen down or fled. At my next discharge, they shot their arrows. I made barricade of my servant, who offered not to fight Twenty or thirty arrows were shot to me, but fell short. I had discharged my pistol three or four times before. Opechanconough, the king of Pamaunck, with two hundred men, surrounded me. Each drew his bow and then lay it on the ground without shooting,My servant explained that I was the captain. They demanded my arms. The rest they said were slain; only me they would spare. My guide implored me not to shoot. In mak ing for the boat, being in the midst of a low quagmire, and minding the Indians more than my steps, 1 stepped directly into the quagmire,as did my Indian also, in trying to draw me out.Thus surprised. I resolved to try their mercy. I cast my arms from me. Until I did this, none dared to approach me; but now they seized me, drew me out of the quagmire, and led me to the king. I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us. The king was well-guarded by twenty bowmen, five on the Blank and five in the rear, and in each flank in front of him a sword and a gun with the same behind him; then a bowman on either side of me. The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back.

                                            Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text- Grade 11/12 Read the text below and answer the questions that follow. Technician Education Can Fuel Financial Success NewsUSA It doesn't take a college degree to understand that a four-year education may not be the end-all and be-all it once was, according to a new survey of U.S. high school students. With rising costs for higher education and the way it equates to a career, more high school students say costs will be a "deciding factor in which college they attend or whether they end up going at all," according to the Washington D.C.-based nonprofit College Savings Foundation. The survey, which is in its 10th year, found that of the 500 students polled, this year saw the highest percentage (55 percent) say they are thinking about technical schools and career schools in the same way they look at traditional universities. This is good news for technical schools (most notably transportation technology and repair), that to date have had trouble attracting students through their doors. "There is more computer code in today's cars than there was used to put a man on the moon," says Jennifer Maher, chief executive officer of the TechForce Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports students through their education into successful careers as professional technicians. "These are skilled, well-paying, technical jobs. "To put this into perspective, according to Motor Authority, a Ford GT has more than 10 million lines of code and the new Ford F150 pickup has more than 150 million lines of code. Compare that to the shuttle's primary flight software, which contains approximately 400,000 lines of code, and it becomes easy to see the necessity of skilled technicians and the job security the industry represents. According to data from the 2020 AutoCare FactBook, the auto care industry added approximately 41,500 jobs in 2018, and automotive repair and maintenance showed the greatest increase ip average hourly wages among technician jobs from 2009 to 2018 More good news: The demand for skilled technicians continues to rise as older technicians retire. Additionally, those numbers increase as technicians move into other industries, and new positions open up. To this point, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the replacement rate plus the growth rate will translate to 78,200 per year from 2016 to 2026. TechForce's publicity campaign, "Because I'm a Tech," encourages technicians to share their Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text Grade 11/12 stories about how they have succeeded in skilled technician careers. Some of their comments: "i bought my first house at age 27," "I get to do something I love every day." "I have a good work/life balance and have time for my hobbies." Technician jobs can be an ideal alternative for many nontraditional learners who can think outside the box, and who enjoy working with their hands and solving problems. Plus, there's the fact that technicians can learn their skills as soon as two years after high school and put them to use right away without the time and expense of a traditional, four-year college degree. TechForce's FutureTech Roadmap to the transportation technology career highlights some of the traits that make for well-paid, successful technicians and how parents and students can identify these valuable skills. Middle School: Sixth-graders to eighth-graders who like to tinker; those who fix the wobbly bike wheel or design the winning car in the scouts' soapbox derby, may benefit from a technical school rather than a traditional college education. High School: The high schooler who helps design and build the sets for the school play may be the next great technician. Also, students with diagnoses of ADHD who learn best with hands-on lessons and struggle with lengthy, desk-bound assignments are ideally suited to many technician careers. Post-Secondary School: High school graduates with a strong interest in science and technology can launch fulfilling careers with training at an ASE-certified program. The more certifications and degrees earned, the higher the tech's earning potential from future employers. Short Response Questions Answer the following questions.

                                            The Harvest That Never CameA long time ago, the Swedish and Danish people were great friends, which was just as well, as their countries were next to each other. Arild Ugerup was the son of a noble Danish family He had a sweetheart, Thale Thott, and they planned to marry soon. But before the couple could make the arrangements, King Erik of Sweden declared war on the Danish people and Arild was captured. Poor Arild was thrown into a dark prison cell and left there alone. He greatly missed his home, his family, and his sweetheart Thale. Arild wondered whether he would ever get to see them again. Then one day, his jailer handed him a letterMy dearest Arild,You know how much I miss you and wish that I could be with you, even for just one hour. Now, I must bring you bad news. My father wants me to marry soon and he says that, as there is no chance of your coming home, I must marry a nobleman from the next village. I fear I will never see you again, dear Arild. It is a terrible thing, but I must obey my father.Your sweetheart,Thale ThottArild was infuriated at what he read. He threw himself at the bolts of the prison door and shook the bars of his prison windows. In his desperation, he even tried to dig a way out through the floor. "If only I were stronger, I could break out of here and go to Thale." That night when he had calmed down, he thought of a better way to do things. "I'll never be strong enough to break out of here. But I can find a way out using my mind." Dipping his pen in an inkwell, he began to write Your Majesty,I know that I am your prisoner. But for the sake of the friendship between us, grant this boon. I have a sweetheart who I must marry soon or stand losing her. I beg Your Majesty to let me go home to marry her. I will stay only as long as it takes to plant and harvest a crop---for it would not be right to leave my wife as soon as we are married. I solemnly swear that after harvesting the crop, I will come straight back to prison. Before long, King Erik's consent came. All went according to Arild's plan. Thale and him were married. Spring, the time for planting, arrived. In a few short months, Arild would have to harvest his crop and return to captivity To stall his return, he thought long and hard on which crop to plant. Then, he went out to the fields and planted each seed of his chosen crop six footsteps apart. Months passed and the once-green leaves shriveled and turned brown. A messenger arrived to escort Arild back to his prison cell. "The King has kept his part of the bargain. Now it is time for you to keep yours, Arild Ugerup," he told Arild. "But my crop has not even sprouted yet, much less been harvested!" The messenger was astounded at this reply. "Not yet sprouted! What in the world did you plant?" "Pine trees." The messenger rushed back to King Erik's court and relayed all that had happened to His Majesty. Upon hearing Arild's cunning, rhe king laughed. "Such a man does not deserve to remain a prisoner!"And Arild stayed with the wife he had fought for so hard. And around his land, a lush green forest attest to his devotion to her.1.

                                            Under Philipppine law, when a woman is guilty of adultery she commits a crime, while for a man,
the crime is not adultery but concubinage. In our country, there is one set of laws for women, and
another set of laws for men, which shows that laws in the Philippines are patriarchal in nature and seem
to favor men over women.
This double standard is not only seen in our laws, but in Philippine society as well, where one
set of rules seems to prevail for women, while another set of rules seem to prevail for men.
This short story explores the issue of infidelity and how it affects the family. Although there is
only one perspective found in this story, there seem to be different perspectives about infidelity that can
be picked up from the actions and words of the other characters. One should read this story closely as
it is carefully constructed to create particular conclusion at the end of the story.
1. Why does it seem acceptable in Philippine society for husbands to have affairs with other women?
2. Is it acceptable for women? Why or why not? What do you think or feel about this?

Having explored twenty miles further in this desert, I found that the river still kept its depth and breadth, but that it was much more thickly lined with trees.Some twelve miles above the barge, we went ashore to refresh ourselves and to cook our food. One of the Indians 1 took with me to examine the nature of the soil and to cross the bends of the river. The other Indian I left with John Robinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches, light, and with the order that they should discharge a gun for my retreat, at the first sight of any Indian.Within a quarter of an hour, I heard a loud cry and the yelling of Indians, but no warning shot. Supposing my companions were surprised, and that the Indian guides had betrayed us, I seized my guide and found his arm fast to my hand with a garter, with my pistol aimed, ready to take revenge upon him. He advised me to fly and seemed ignorant of what was happening.But as he went on, I was struck with an arrow on the right thigh, without however, being seriously harmed. When this happened, I caught sight of two Indians drawing their bows. I prevented them from shooting by firing my French pistol.By the time I had loaded again, three or four more Indians were making ready to shoot. The first had fallen down or fled. At my next discharge, they shot their arrows. I made barricade of my servant, who offered not to fight Twenty or thirty arrows were shot to me, but fell short. I had discharged my pistol three or four times before. Opechanconough, the king of Pamaunck, with two hundred men, surrounded me. Each drew his bow and then lay it on the ground without shooting,My servant explained that I was the captain. They demanded my arms. The rest they said were slain; only me they would spare. My guide implored me not to shoot. In mak ing for the boat, being in the midst of a low quagmire, and minding the Indians more than my steps, 1 stepped directly into the quagmire,as did my Indian also, in trying to draw me out.Thus surprised. I resolved to try their mercy. I cast my arms from me. Until I did this, none dared to approach me; but now they seized me, drew me out of the quagmire, and led me to the king. I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us. The king was well-guarded by twenty bowmen, five on the Blank and five in the rear, and in each flank in front of him a sword and a gun with the same behind him; then a bowman on either side of me. The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back. On each flank was a sergeant, one running constantly toward the front, the other toward the rear, at a regular pace in good order. After this performance had lasted for sometime the warriors rushed into a circle with a dance: and finally each man departed for his lodging. The captain conducted me to his lodging, and gave me for supper a quarter of venison and some ten pounds of bread. What I left was kept for me, and sent with me to my lodging.​ paki sagot po plsss ​​</a>

                                            Rich People Problems
an excerpt by Kevin Kwan
1 Bettina Ortiz y Meña was not accustomed to waiting. A former Miss
Venezuela and Miss Universe runner-up, of course, the exceedingly bronzed
strawberry blond was these days the wife of Miami auto-parts tycoon, Herman Ortiz
y Meña, and at every restaurant she chose to grace with her presence, she was
always greeted with reverence and whisked to the exact table she desired. Today she
wanted the corner table on the terrace at Sip Sip, her favorite lunch spot on Harbor
Island.
She wanted to sit on one of the comfy orange canvas director's chairs and
stare out at the gently lapping turquoise waters while eating her Kale Caesar salad,
but there was a large noisy group taking up the entire terrace and they didn't seem
in4nuch hurry to leave.
2 Bettina fumed as she glared at the tourists happily savoring their lunch in
the sun. Look how tacky they were...the woman overly tanned, wrinkled, and saggy,
none of them properly lifted or botoxed.
She felt like walking up to their table and handing out her dermatologist's
business cards. And the men were even worse. All dressed in all rumpled shirts and
shorts, wearing those cheap straw hats sold at the trinket shot on Dunmore Street.
Why did such people have to come here?
3 The three-and-a-half-mile-long paradise with its pristine pink-sand
beaches was one of the best-kept secrets in the Caribbean, a haven for the very rich
filled with quaint little wood houses painted in shades of sherbet, charmin
boutiques, chic oceanfront mansions turned into inns, and five-star restaurants to
rival St. Barths. Tourists should have to take a style exam before being allowed to
set foot on the Island! Feeling that she had been patient long enough, Bettina
stormed into the kitchen, the fringe on her crocheted Pucci caftan top shaking
furiously as she made a beeline for the woman with a shock of pixie-cut blond hair
manning the main stove.
4 "Julie, honey, what's the dealio? I've waited more than fifteen minute
my table!" Bettina sighed to the owner of the restaurant.
"Sorry, Bettina, it's been one of those days. The party of twelve on the ter
lowed up first just before you did," Julie replied as she handed off a bowl of spicy
conch chili to waiting server.
"But the terrace is your prime spot! Why on earth did you let those tourists
take up all that space?"
5 "Well, that tourist in the red fishing cap is the Duke of Glencora. His party
just boated over from Windermere - that's his Royal Huisman you see moored off
the coast. Isn't it the most handsome sailboat you've ever seen?"
6 "I'm not impressed by big boats," Bettina huffed, although secretly she wasThey even searched my walk-in freezer. See that Chinese fellow seated at the
end of the table?"
Bettina squinted through her Dior Extase sunglasses at the portly, balding,
seventy-something Asian man dressed in a nondescript white short-sleeved golf
shirt and gray trousers. "Oh, I didn't even notice him! Am I supposed to know who
he is?"
That's Alfred Shang, Julie said in a hushed tone.
&gt; Bettina giggled. "He looks like their chauffeur. Doesn't he look like that guy
that used to drive Jane Wyman around in Falcon Crest?"
Julie, who was trying to focus on searing a cut of tuna to perfection, shook her head
a tight-lipped smile. "From what I hear, that chauffeur is the most powerful man in
Asia."
"What's his name again?"

You will get 1pt.each for both challenge and strength/ weakness. Summary of “FAITH, LOVE, TIME AND DR. LAZARO” By: Gregorio Brillantes Lazaro is a pool of darkness surrounded by light. Indeed, light, its retreat and approach, its highs and ebbs, is a central motif throughout the story and one which must be watched closely. Light is associated with all the things Lazaro no longer believes in. One, it is associated with faith, Mrs. Lazaro had resumed her knitting; in the circle of yellow light, her head bowed, she seemed absorbed in some contemplative prayer... He hurried down the carving stairs, under the votive lamps of the Sacred Heart. Two, light is also associated with those he loves but is distant from, notably Ben, his son, In the glow of the dashboard lights, the boy's face relaxed, smiled. Third, light is finally also associated with life itself. Their final stop before heading to the hut where the death of the baby waits is a gas station, its fluorescent lights the only brightness on the plain before them, on the road that led farther into deeper darkness. This is the final outpost, bathed in light, before they enter death's realm and administer to a baby Lazaro knows he cannot save. (The descent towards darkness and death is further seen in their crossing of a river, to drown here in the depths of the night before they reach the hut - an allusion to the River Styx.) Once they reach Esteban's hut, darkness is well and truly entrenched; so much so that even light can only be described in relation to darkness, 'We're here doctor,' Esteban said, and they padded up a stretch of sand to a clump of trees; a dog started to bark, the shadows of a kerosene lamp wavered at a window. The preponderance of darkness, and the linking of existential themes to light (themes which Lazaro yearns for but can no longer believe in), illustrates that Lazaro is a damaged man; scarred irrevocably by his work (duty had taken the place of an exhausted compassion) and the loss of his first son (He closed his eyes, erasing the slashed wrists, part of the future dead in a boarding-house room... Sorrow lay in ambush among the years.). That Lazarus is damaged is aptly seen in the darkness surrounding him. He thought of light years, black space, and infinite distances; in the unmeasured universe, man's life flared briefly and was gone, traceless in the void. But can there be a resurrection? After all the character's name harkens to the biblical Lazarus who was literally raised out of darkness. There are encouraging signs as the short story progresses that Lazaro tentatively takes some steps towards the light, ie. he begins to believe again in faith, hope and love. The catalyst for this spark of belief is Ben, his last son, He could sense the boy groping for the tremendous answers... a woman bathed in light appeared before children, and mortal men spoke of eternal life... With unaccustomed tenderness he placed a hand on Ben's shoulder as they turned toward the cement-walled house. Lazaro comes close. But just as Ben tries to articulate all the light his father has lost, of faith and hope, the light becomes too strong and blind Lazarus. This is literally seen in the story for just as Lazarus again yearns to believe, A bus roared around a hill toward them, its lights blinding him. Lazaro falls back into darkness and is denied the light. Instead of faith, hope and love he is consigned back to his tomb of death and dirt. In the headlights the dust sifted down and when the air was clear again, Dr. Lazaro, swallowing a taste of earth, of darkness, maneuvered the car back onto the road, his arms numb and exhausted. There is no resurrection for this story's Lazarus. POINTS The darkness though does not make Lazaro an evil man. He is simply tired, a character who has seen too much and who, like Job, asks what did man do to deserve this lot. The sparrow does not fall without the Father's leave, he mused at the sky, but it falls just the same. But to what end are the sufferings of a child? And again like Job, Lazarus has the temerity to insist that is wrong and to ask the only question there is to ask; why?

                                            READ THIS SHORT STORY THEN ANSWER OF THE FOLLOWINGSTORYThere was a man that had 2 sons. The younger son told his father that he wanted his part of the inheritance. So the father divided what he had, and gave part to the son.A couple days later, the younger son packed up his belongings and traveled to a country far away.And he wasted what he had with extravagant living. He partied, spent time with women and wasted his money. After he had spent all the money that his father had given him, a severe famine came to the land. This means there was a food shortage, and now he doesn’t have money or food to take care of himself.He went to work for someone in that country and he was sent into the fields to feed the pigs. He was so hungry, he would have gladly eaten the pigs food, but no one gave him any food. He thought to himself…My father has servants, and they have bread to spare, and here I am hungry! He decided he would go home to his father and tell him: “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.”  I’m not even worthy to be called your son! Make me one of your servants.He made the journey back to his father. When he was far away, his father saw him and had sympathy for him. His father ran and kissed him! He told his father that he has sinned and “I’m not worthy to be called your son.” BUT, the father told his servants to bring out the best robe and put it on him…put a ring on his hand…and sandals on his feet. He told them to bring the fatted calf and let us eat and be happy! My son was dead and now he is alive! He was lost and now he is found!But, the older son was in the field. As he came to the house, heard the music and asked a servant what was going on. He told him that his brother has returned home. He is safe and sound and your father is having a celebration.Well, he was angry. He wouldn’t go in the house. So his father came out to see him and pleaded with him. He told his father that he has stayed home and helped him and his father hasn’t ever had a celebration for him and his friends!But as soon as my brother comes back, who has wasted all his money, now you serve a great meal for him. His father told him that yes, he was always there for him, and everything that he had, would be his. But it is right to be happy, because his brother was dead, and is now alive. He was lost and now he is found.In this parable, Jesus is telling us that when we are sinners and are doing things with our money and friends that God doesn’t like it's like we have left Him, like the son that left home.We are lost, but when you decide to change your life, you go back to the Father, Who is God in heaven. You ask for forgiveness of what you did wrong. God is always happy when we come back to Him!Jesus loves us, and, He will welcome us just like the son was welcomed back home by his father.QUESTION.*If you are the lost or the prodigal one, what would you do to actually ask for forgiveness from your father and older brother?____________​</a>

It is set during the Spanish Civil War and revolves around an old man who is forced to leave his home due to the war.

The central conflict is the old man's fear of not being able to reach safety before the enemy arrives.</p><p></p><p>The theme of the story is the fragility of life and the human experience of facing death. The story reveals a significant truth about life in that even the most seemingly insignificant individuals have their own stories and fears, and that the inevitability of death makes all lives equally important.</p><p></p><p>One of the characters' observations that rings true is the soldier's comment that "War is not won by evacuation." This statement highlights the fact that war is not just about military strategy and victory, but also about the impact it has on individuals and their lives.</p><p></p><p>The old man is a complex character, as he is not just a representative of the war's civilian casualties, but also a symbol of the human experience of facing mortality and the fear of the unknown.</p><p></p><p>A short story is a work of fiction that is typically shorter than a novel, with a focused plot and limited number of characters. It differs from a poem in that it is prose rather than verse, and from a drama in that it is not intended to be performed. An essay is a nonfiction work that explores a topic or idea, typically in a more structured and analytical format than a short story</p><br />

                            6. Think again about the story "Captured by Opechancanough."Note that the narrator tells about his travels. A travel account iscalled a journal. The journal of Captain John Smith-a recordof the perils and frustrations of America's first settlers-is oneof the first literature of America."Capture by Opechancanough"              An excerpt           By John SmithWith two Indians for my quides and two of our own company, I set out, leaving seven in the barge. Having explored twenty miles further in this desert, I found that the river still kept its depth and breadth, but that it was much more thickly lined with trees.Some twelve miles above the barge, we went ashore to refresh ourselves and to cook our food. One of the Indians 1 took with me to examine the nature of the soil and to cross the bends of the river. The other Indian I left with John Robinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches, light, and with the order that they should discharge a gun for my retreat, at the first sight of any Indian.Within a quarter of an hour, I heard a loud cry and the yelling of Indians, but no warning shot. Supposing my companions were surprised, and that the Indian guides had betrayed us, I seized my guide and found his arm fast to my hand with a garter, with my pistol aimed, ready to take revenge upon him. He advised me to fly and seemed ignorant of what was happening.But as he went on, I was struck with an arrow on the right thigh, without however, being seriously harmed. When this happened, I caught sight of two Indians drawing their bows. I prevented them from shooting by firing my French pistol.By the time I had loaded again, three or four more Indians were making ready to shoot. The first had fallen down or fled. At my next discharge, they shot their arrows. I made barricade of my servant, who offered not to fight Twenty or thirty arrows were shot to me, but fell short. I had discharged my pistol three or four times before. Opechanconough, the king of Pamaunck, with two hundred men, surrounded me. Each drew his bow and then lay it on the ground without shooting,My servant explained that I was the captain. They demanded my arms. The rest they said were slain; only me they would spare. My guide implored me not to shoot. In mak ing for the boat, being in the midst of a low quagmire, and minding the Indians more than my steps, 1 stepped directly into the quagmire,as did my Indian also, in trying to draw me out.Thus surprised. I resolved to try their mercy. I cast my arms from me. Until I did this, none dared to approach me; but now they seized me, drew me out of the quagmire, and led me to the king. I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us. The king was well-guarded by twenty bowmen, five on the Blank and five in the rear, and in each flank in front of him a sword and a gun with the same behind him; then a bowman on either side of me. The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back. On each flank was a sergeant, one running constantly toward the front, the other toward the rear, at a regular pace in good order. After this performance had lasted for sometime the warriors rushed into a circle with a dance: and finally each man departed for his lodging. The captain conducted me to his lodging, and gave me for supper a quarter of venison and some ten pounds of bread. What I left was kept for me, and sent with me to my lodging.​</h2><br />

                            7. Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text- Grade 11/12 Read the text below and answer the questions that follow. Technician Education Can Fuel Financial Success NewsUSA It doesn't take a college degree to understand that a four-year education may not be the end-all and be-all it once was, according to a new survey of U.S. high school students. With rising costs for higher education and the way it equates to a career, more high school students say costs will be a "deciding factor in which college they attend or whether they end up going at all," according to the Washington D.C.-based nonprofit College Savings Foundation. The survey, which is in its 10th year, found that of the 500 students polled, this year saw the highest percentage (55 percent) say they are thinking about technical schools and career schools in the same way they look at traditional universities. This is good news for technical schools (most notably transportation technology and repair), that to date have had trouble attracting students through their doors. "There is more computer code in today's cars than there was used to put a man on the moon," says Jennifer Maher, chief executive officer of the TechForce Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports students through their education into successful careers as professional technicians. "These are skilled, well-paying, technical jobs. "To put this into perspective, according to Motor Authority, a Ford GT has more than 10 million lines of code and the new Ford F150 pickup has more than 150 million lines of code. Compare that to the shuttle's primary flight software, which contains approximately 400,000 lines of code, and it becomes easy to see the necessity of skilled technicians and the job security the industry represents. According to data from the 2020 AutoCare FactBook, the auto care industry added approximately 41,500 jobs in 2018, and automotive repair and maintenance showed the greatest increase ip average hourly wages among technician jobs from 2009 to 2018 More good news: The demand for skilled technicians continues to rise as older technicians retire. Additionally, those numbers increase as technicians move into other industries, and new positions open up. To this point, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the replacement rate plus the growth rate will translate to 78,200 per year from 2016 to 2026. TechForce's publicity campaign, "Because I'm a Tech," encourages technicians to share their Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text Grade 11/12 stories about how they have succeeded in skilled technician careers. Some of their comments: "i bought my first house at age 27," "I get to do something I love every day." "I have a good work/life balance and have time for my hobbies." Technician jobs can be an ideal alternative for many nontraditional learners who can think outside the box, and who enjoy working with their hands and solving problems. Plus, there's the fact that technicians can learn their skills as soon as two years after high school and put them to use right away without the time and expense of a traditional, four-year college degree. TechForce's FutureTech Roadmap to the transportation technology career highlights some of the traits that make for well-paid, successful technicians and how parents and students can identify these valuable skills. Middle School: Sixth-graders to eighth-graders who like to tinker; those who fix the wobbly bike wheel or design the winning car in the scouts' soapbox derby, may benefit from a technical school rather than a traditional college education. High School: The high schooler who helps design and build the sets for the school play may be the next great technician. Also, students with diagnoses of ADHD who learn best with hands-on lessons and struggle with lengthy, desk-bound assignments are ideally suited to many technician careers. Post-Secondary School: High school graduates with a strong interest in science and technology can launch fulfilling careers with training at an ASE-certified program. The more certifications and degrees earned, the higher the tech's earning potential from future employers. Short Response Questions Answer the following questions.

                            8. The Harvest That Never CameA long time ago, the Swedish and Danish people were great friends, which was just as well, as their countries were next to each other. Arild Ugerup was the son of a noble Danish family He had a sweetheart, Thale Thott, and they planned to marry soon. But before the couple could make the arrangements, King Erik of Sweden declared war on the Danish people and Arild was captured. Poor Arild was thrown into a dark prison cell and left there alone. He greatly missed his home, his family, and his sweetheart Thale. Arild wondered whether he would ever get to see them again. Then one day, his jailer handed him a letterMy dearest Arild,You know how much I miss you and wish that I could be with you, even for just one hour. Now, I must bring you bad news. My father wants me to marry soon and he says that, as there is no chance of your coming home, I must marry a nobleman from the next village. I fear I will never see you again, dear Arild. It is a terrible thing, but I must obey my father.Your sweetheart,Thale ThottArild was infuriated at what he read. He threw himself at the bolts of the prison door and shook the bars of his prison windows. In his desperation, he even tried to dig a way out through the floor. "If only I were stronger, I could break out of here and go to Thale." That night when he had calmed down, he thought of a better way to do things. "I'll never be strong enough to break out of here. But I can find a way out using my mind." Dipping his pen in an inkwell, he began to write Your Majesty,I know that I am your prisoner. But for the sake of the friendship between us, grant this boon. I have a sweetheart who I must marry soon or stand losing her. I beg Your Majesty to let me go home to marry her. I will stay only as long as it takes to plant and harvest a crop---for it would not be right to leave my wife as soon as we are married. I solemnly swear that after harvesting the crop, I will come straight back to prison. Before long, King Erik's consent came. All went according to Arild's plan. Thale and him were married. Spring, the time for planting, arrived. In a few short months, Arild would have to harvest his crop and return to captivity To stall his return, he thought long and hard on which crop to plant. Then, he went out to the fields and planted each seed of his chosen crop six footsteps apart. Months passed and the once-green leaves shriveled and turned brown. A messenger arrived to escort Arild back to his prison cell. "The King has kept his part of the bargain. Now it is time for you to keep yours, Arild Ugerup," he told Arild. "But my crop has not even sprouted yet, much less been harvested!" The messenger was astounded at this reply. "Not yet sprouted! What in the world did you plant?" "Pine trees." The messenger rushed back to King Erik's court and relayed all that had happened to His Majesty. Upon hearing Arild's cunning, rhe king laughed. "Such a man does not deserve to remain a prisoner!"And Arild stayed with the wife he had fought for so hard. And around his land, a lush green forest attest to his devotion to her.1.

                            9. Under Philipppine law, when a woman is guilty of adultery she commits a crime, while for a man,
the crime is not adultery but concubinage. In our country, there is one set of laws for women, and
another set of laws for men, which shows that laws in the Philippines are patriarchal in nature and seem
to favor men over women.
This double standard is not only seen in our laws, but in Philippine society as well, where one
set of rules seems to prevail for women, while another set of rules seem to prevail for men.
This short story explores the issue of infidelity and how it affects the family. Although there is
only one perspective found in this story, there seem to be different perspectives about infidelity that can
be picked up from the actions and words of the other characters. One should read this story closely as
it is carefully constructed to create particular conclusion at the end of the story.

                            12. Rich People Problems
an excerpt by Kevin Kwan
1 Bettina Ortiz y Meña was not accustomed to waiting. A former Miss
Venezuela and Miss Universe runner-up, of course, the exceedingly bronzed
strawberry blond was these days the wife of Miami auto-parts tycoon, Herman Ortiz
y Meña, and at every restaurant she chose to grace with her presence, she was
always greeted with reverence and whisked to the exact table she desired. Today she
wanted the corner table on the terrace at Sip Sip, her favorite lunch spot on Harbor
Island.
She wanted to sit on one of the comfy orange canvas director's chairs and
stare out at the gently lapping turquoise waters while eating her Kale Caesar salad,
but there was a large noisy group taking up the entire terrace and they didn't seem
in4nuch hurry to leave.
2 Bettina fumed as she glared at the tourists happily savoring their lunch in
the sun. Look how tacky they were...the woman overly tanned, wrinkled, and saggy,
none of them properly lifted or botoxed.
She felt like walking up to their table and handing out her dermatologist's
business cards. And the men were even worse. All dressed in all rumpled shirts and
shorts, wearing those cheap straw hats sold at the trinket shot on Dunmore Street.
Why did such people have to come here?
3 The three-and-a-half-mile-long paradise with its pristine pink-sand
beaches was one of the best-kept secrets in the Caribbean, a haven for the very rich
filled with quaint little wood houses painted in shades of sherbet, charmin
boutiques, chic oceanfront mansions turned into inns, and five-star restaurants to
rival St. Barths. Tourists should have to take a style exam before being allowed to
set foot on the Island! Feeling that she had been patient long enough, Bettina
stormed into the kitchen, the fringe on her crocheted Pucci caftan top shaking
furiously as she made a beeline for the woman with a shock of pixie-cut blond hair
manning the main stove.
4 "Julie, honey, what's the dealio? I've waited more than fifteen minute
my table!" Bettina sighed to the owner of the restaurant.
"Sorry, Bettina, it's been one of those days. The party of twelve on the ter
lowed up first just before you did," Julie replied as she handed off a bowl of spicy
conch chili to waiting server.
"But the terrace is your prime spot! Why on earth did you let those tourists
take up all that space?"
5 "Well, that tourist in the red fishing cap is the Duke of Glencora. His party
just boated over from Windermere - that's his Royal Huisman you see moored off
the coast. Isn't it the most handsome sailboat you've ever seen?"
6 "I'm not impressed by big boats," Bettina huffed, although secretly she wasThey even searched my walk-in freezer. See that Chinese fellow seated at the
end of the table?"
Bettina squinted through her Dior Extase sunglasses at the portly, balding,
seventy-something Asian man dressed in a nondescript white short-sleeved golf
shirt and gray trousers. "Oh, I didn't even notice him! Am I supposed to know who
he is?"
That's Alfred Shang, Julie said in a hushed tone.
&gt; Bettina giggled. "He looks like their chauffeur. Doesn't he look like that guy
that used to drive Jane Wyman around in Falcon Crest?"
Julie, who was trying to focus on searing a cut of tuna to perfection, shook her head
a tight-lipped smile. "From what I hear, that chauffeur is the most powerful man in
Asia."
"What's his name again?"

You will get 1pt.each for both challenge and strength/ weakness. Summary of “FAITH, LOVE, TIME AND DR. LAZARO” By: Gregorio Brillantes Lazaro is a pool of darkness surrounded by light. Indeed, light, its retreat and approach, its highs and ebbs, is a central motif throughout the story and one which must be watched closely. Light is associated with all the things Lazaro no longer believes in. One, it is associated with faith, Mrs. Lazaro had resumed her knitting; in the circle of yellow light, her head bowed, she seemed absorbed in some contemplative prayer... He hurried down the carving stairs, under the votive lamps of the Sacred Heart. Two, light is also associated with those he loves but is distant from, notably Ben, his son, In the glow of the dashboard lights, the boy's face relaxed, smiled. Third, light is finally also associated with life itself. Their final stop before heading to the hut where the death of the baby waits is a gas station, its fluorescent lights the only brightness on the plain before them, on the road that led farther into deeper darkness. This is the final outpost, bathed in light, before they enter death's realm and administer to a baby Lazaro knows he cannot save. (The descent towards darkness and death is further seen in their crossing of a river, to drown here in the depths of the night before they reach the hut - an allusion to the River Styx.) Once they reach Esteban's hut, darkness is well and truly entrenched; so much so that even light can only be described in relation to darkness, 'We're here doctor,' Esteban said, and they padded up a stretch of sand to a clump of trees; a dog started to bark, the shadows of a kerosene lamp wavered at a window. The preponderance of darkness, and the linking of existential themes to light (themes which Lazaro yearns for but can no longer believe in), illustrates that Lazaro is a damaged man; scarred irrevocably by his work (duty had taken the place of an exhausted compassion) and the loss of his first son (He closed his eyes, erasing the slashed wrists, part of the future dead in a boarding-house room... Sorrow lay in ambush among the years.). That Lazarus is damaged is aptly seen in the darkness surrounding him. He thought of light years, black space, and infinite distances; in the unmeasured universe, man's life flared briefly and was gone, traceless in the void. But can there be a resurrection? After all the character's name harkens to the biblical Lazarus who was literally raised out of darkness. There are encouraging signs as the short story progresses that Lazaro tentatively takes some steps towards the light, ie. he begins to believe again in faith, hope and love. The catalyst for this spark of belief is Ben, his last son, He could sense the boy groping for the tremendous answers... a woman bathed in light appeared before children, and mortal men spoke of eternal life... With unaccustomed tenderness he placed a hand on Ben's shoulder as they turned toward the cement-walled house. Lazaro comes close. But just as Ben tries to articulate all the light his father has lost, of faith and hope, the light becomes too strong and blind Lazarus. This is literally seen in the story for just as Lazarus again yearns to believe, A bus roared around a hill toward them, its lights blinding him. Lazaro falls back into darkness and is denied the light. Instead of faith, hope and love he is consigned back to his tomb of death and dirt. In the headlights the dust sifted down and when the air was clear again, Dr. Lazaro, swallowing a taste of earth, of darkness, maneuvered the car back onto the road, his arms numb and exhausted. There is no resurrection for this story's Lazarus. POINTS The darkness though does not make Lazaro an evil man. He is simply tired, a character who has seen too much and who, like Job, asks what did man do to deserve this lot. The sparrow does not fall without the Father's leave, he mused at the sky, but it falls just the same. But to what end are the sufferings of a child? And again like Job, Lazarus has the temerity to insist that is wrong and to ask the only question there is to ask; why?

</p><p>Curious, but somewhat disappointed the young man opened the box and found a lovely leather bound Bible with his name embossed on it in gold. He was angry so he raised his voice to his father and said, "With all of your money you give me a Bible rather than the sports car I wanted.” He then stormed out of the house leaving the Bible behind.
</p><p>
</p><p>Many years passed and the young man was very successful in the business he went in. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family but realized when he thought about his father that he was very old. He then decided that perhaps he should go to see him because he had not seen him since that graduation day.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, before he could make arrangements to go he received a phone call from a funeral home director telling him that his father had passed away and had willed all of his possessions to him. He was told that he needed to come home immediately and take care of things.
</p><p>
</p><p>When the son arrived at his father’s house sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his father’s important documents and saw the Bible his father had given him for graduation. The Bible looked new just as it was years ago when he was given it.
</p><p>
</p><p>With tears in his eyes he opened the Bible and began to turn through the pages. His father had carefully underlined a verse which was Matthew 7:11 which reads, "And if ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your Heavenly Father which is in Heaven give to those who ask Him.”
</p><p>
</p><p>As the son read those words a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag on it with the car dealer’s name, the same dealer who had the sports car that he wanted so badly for his college graduation. On the tag was the date of his graduation and the words written in large print "PAID IN FULL.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Many times during our lifetime we miss God’s blessings because they are not packaged as we expected them to be.
</p><p>
</p><p>If this true story has touched your heart and you have a son or daughter graduating from high school or college this year give them what they want if you can afford it but also give them a Bible as well with their name engraved on the front of it.
</p><p>
</p><p>Graduates, may I tell you what opportunity is and when it knocks. Opportunity will never knock. You can wait your entire life listening and hoping that the right opportunity for you will knock, but rest assured that it will not knock.
</p><p>
</p><p>You are a high school or college graduate now and you are opportunity and you must knock on the door that you wish will lead you to where you wish to go in life.
</p><p>
</p><p>By graduating you have prepared yourself to recognize the opportunity you wish to pursue so siege that opportunity as you develop the strength of your personality and build a self-image with which you are able to live with.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            23. READ THIS SHORT STORY THEN ANSWER OF THE FOLLOWINGSTORYThere was a man that had 2 sons. The younger son told his father that he wanted his part of the inheritance. So the father divided what he had, and gave part to the son.A couple days later, the younger son packed up his belongings and traveled to a country far away.And he wasted what he had with extravagant living. He partied, spent time with women and wasted his money. After he had spent all the money that his father had given him, a severe famine came to the land. This means there was a food shortage, and now he doesn’t have money or food to take care of himself.He went to work for someone in that country and he was sent into the fields to feed the pigs. He was so hungry, he would have gladly eaten the pigs food, but no one gave him any food. He thought to himself…My father has servants, and they have bread to spare, and here I am hungry! He decided he would go home to his father and tell him: “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.”  I’m not even worthy to be called your son! Make me one of your servants.He made the journey back to his father. When he was far away, his father saw him and had sympathy for him. His father ran and kissed him! He told his father that he has sinned and “I’m not worthy to be called your son.” BUT, the father told his servants to bring out the best robe and put it on him…put a ring on his hand…and sandals on his feet. He told them to bring the fatted calf and let us eat and be happy! My son was dead and now he is alive! He was lost and now he is found!But, the older son was in the field. As he came to the house, heard the music and asked a servant what was going on. He told him that his brother has returned home. He is safe and sound and your father is having a celebration.Well, he was angry. He wouldn’t go in the house. So his father came out to see him and pleaded with him. He told his father that he has stayed home and helped him and his father hasn’t ever had a celebration for him and his friends!But as soon as my brother comes back, who has wasted all his money, now you serve a great meal for him. His father told him that yes, he was always there for him, and everything that he had, would be his. But it is right to be happy, because his brother was dead, and is now alive. He was lost and now he is found.In this parable, Jesus is telling us that when we are sinners and are doing things with our money and friends that God doesn’t like it's like we have left Him, like the son that left home.We are lost, but when you decide to change your life, you go back to the Father, Who is God in heaven. You ask for forgiveness of what you did wrong. God is always happy when we come back to Him!Jesus loves us, and, He will welcome us just like the son was welcomed back home by his father.QUESTION.*If you are the lost or the prodigal one, what would you do to actually ask for forgiveness from your father and older brother?____________​</h2><br />

-Read the following excerpt from the short story, Dead Stars by Paz Marquez Benitez:  Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago.

What narrative device was used in the paragraph? 
= Flashback  
-Read the following example of a definition paragraph:  The term protein quality refers to the ratio of essential amino acids (eaa) in a protein in comparison with the ratio required by the body.

= Objective description  
-Read the following example of a definition paragraph:  Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194).  What is the strategy used in the development of the paragraph? 
= Extensive definition

Falling action is the part of a story where the consequences or changes of situation start to arise. Simile is the figurative speech that shows two things exactly the same. First person pertains to the main character of the story. This is commonly the first introduced character or subject from the story. Flashback is the process of reminiscing or looking back from the past. It is part of stories sometimes. Denotation means the literal and true meaning and definition of words. Objective description is fact-based writing or description. The word "Narration" was derived from the latin word, narrare. <br />
