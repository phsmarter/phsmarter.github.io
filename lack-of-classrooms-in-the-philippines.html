                            1. what is lacking in a homeschooling that is in the classroom setting?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Parents who want to homeschool their children but still have some reservations about it should take time to consider the positive and negative aspects of homeschooling.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps and pa brainliests po (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>You might wonder if kids have to go to school. It's true that kids must be educated, but it's legal to be schooled at home. In fact, more than 1 million students do it. These kids can learn just as they do in regular school, but their parents are in charge of their education.
</p><p>
</p><p>Homeschool parents must make sure that their kids get the instruction and the experiences they need. The parents also may have to file paperwork with the state to explain who's teaching the kid and which subjects are being covered.</p><p>What Are Some Advantages?
</p><p>Kids who are homeschooled may benefit from the one-on-one attention. For instance, if you don't understand something in math, the whole class won't be moving on without you. You might be the whole class! It's also possible that you might learn more than you would in a regular classroom, because if you really excel at something, you can keep learning more at your own pace.
</p><p>
</p><p>Kids who are homeschooled also may get out in their communities more than other kids. They might get to experience hands-on education at museums, libraries, businesses, marinas, and other community resources. They also might volunteer or participate in "service learning" where they take on local projects.</p><p>What Are the Disadvantages?
</p><p>People disagree about how much formal education a person needs to be a good teacher. Not all parents and homeschool tutors have gone to school to learn to teach or to learn the subject they are teaching. If a parent is well educated, he or she may understand some subjects really well but others not as well. For instance, a kid's mom may be great at chemistry but not as good at English.
</p><p>
</p><p>To be fair, not all schoolteachers are experts in their fields either. And tutors may be used for subjects the parent isn't skilled in. If a homeschool parent or tutor doesn't know something or can't fully explain it, the instructor and student can always research the issue together. A local library, university, community college, or the Internet may have the answers.
</p><p>
</p><p>A kid who's homeschooled doesn't have the convenience of school facilities, such as a gymnasium, science lab, or art studio. The child may be taught at the kitchen table or at a "school" area in the home. He or she might do science experiments in the kitchen or go outside to work on an art project. Some parents who homeschool their kids form groups so their kids can go together to take art classes and take part in other group learning activities, like field trips.
</p><p>
</p><p>Effects on social life can be another possible disadvantage for homeschooled kids. All kids need to have friends and be around other children. Some homeschoolers may feel cut off from kids their age or feel like they spend too much time with their families.
</p><p>
</p><p>Parents who homeschool their kids often make efforts to ensure their son or daughter has a social life. For instance, groups of homeschooled children may get together regularly to learn together or just socialize. And like any child, they may be on sports teams, in dance classes, or take part in other activities outside of school.

                            3. problem: lack of classrooms solution: 1. 2. 3.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Here are three possible solutions for the problem of lack of classrooms:</p><p></p>Construct additional classrooms - This solution involves building new classrooms to accommodate the increasing number of students. The construction of new classrooms can be done by the school administration, government agencies, or through public-private partnerships. The availability of funds and suitable space for construction are critical factors that need to be considered.Implement staggered class schedules - This solution involves dividing the students into groups and having them attend classes at different times of the day. For instance, the first group may attend classes from 7:00 am to 12:00 pm, while the second group attends from 1:00 pm to 6:00 pm. This will allow more students to use the available classrooms without overcrowding.Utilize technology for remote learning - This solution involves using technology to deliver classes to students who are not physically present in the classroom. This can be done through online classes, video conferencing, or other technological tools that allow students to learn from home. This solution may require the school to provide devices and internet connectivity to students who may not have access to these resources.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are several potential solutions to address the issue of a lack of classrooms:</p><p></p><p>1. Create a staggered schedule: One option could be to divide the students into multiple groups and stagger their schedules so that each group attends school at different times of the day or week. This would require fewer classrooms at any given time, allowing schools to accommodate more students with limited resources.</p><p></p><p>2. Utilize alternative learning spaces: Schools could consider utilizing alternative learning spaces such as libraries, gymnasiums, or even outdoor spaces for classes. This would require some creativity and flexibility from teachers and students, but it could help alleviate the space constraints.</p><p></p><p>3. Utilize technology: Another option is to use technology to provide remote learning opportunities. This could involve setting up virtual classrooms, utilizing video conferencing software, or providing access to online resources and materials. While this solution may not work for all students, it could help free up physical space in the classroom for those who need it most.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the best solution will depend on the specific circumstances and resources available to each school. It may be necessary to combine multiple approaches or develop new strategies to effectively address the issue of a lack of classrooms.</p><br />

                            5.  Emely found out that the leaves of the plants inside the classroom becomes yellowish despite being watered every day. What must be lacking in the plants? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answers and Explanation:</strong></p><p>The most common reason that plants’ leaves turn yellow is because of moisture stress, which can be from either over-watering or under-watering. If you have a plant that has yellow leaves, check the soil in the pot to see if the soil is dry.</p><p></p><p>If you believe that the problem is due to under watering, water the plant more often and consider letting the pot sit on a dish to recollect any water that has overflowed, so that the roots can absorb the extra water.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, over watering can contribute to the leaves turning yellow as well.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>yes</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>because learner-centered education empowers the students to take ownership of what they learn by focusing on how the new knowledge solves a problem or adds value. Instead of simply pouring information over the child’s mind, the facilitator presents the student with an issue and guides the class as they build a solution. Students “discover” the new information and come up with solutions instead of passively waiting for the teacher’s answers</p><br />

                            9. Give 5 Multicultural issues in the Philippines classroom​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Philippines is a diverse country with a rich cultural heritage that includes indigenous, Malay, Chinese, and Spanish influences. However, like many other countries, the Philippines also faces challenges in creating an inclusive and culturally-sensitive learning environment. Here are five multicultural issues that can arise in Philippine classrooms:</p><p></p><p>1. Language barriers: The Philippines has over 100 languages, with Tagalog being the national language. In some areas, students may speak a dialect or language that is different from the language of instruction. This can create communication barriers and make it difficult for students to fully understand the lessons.</p><p></p><p>2. Cultural sensitivity: The Philippines has a diverse range of cultural practices and beliefs, and it is important for teachers to be sensitive to these differences. For example, some students may have dietary restrictions or observe different religious holidays. Teachers should be aware of these differences and strive to create an inclusive and respectful learning environment.</p><p></p><p>3. Stereotyping and discrimination: Like many other countries, the Philippines has a history of discrimination based on race, ethnicity, and social class. This can lead to stereotypes and prejudices that can affect students' self-esteem and academic performance. Teachers should be aware of these issues and work to promote diversity and inclusivity in the classroom.</p><p></p><p>4. Historical and political issues: The Philippines has a complex history that includes colonization, political unrest, and social inequality. These issues can have a significant impact on students' perceptions of themselves and their country. Teachers should be aware of these issues and strive to create a safe and supportive learning environment that encourages critical thinking and open discussion.</p><p></p><p>5. Inequity in access to education: While the Philippines has made significant strides in improving access to education, there are still significant disparities in access to quality education, particularly in rural areas. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds may face additional challenges such as poverty, malnutrition, and lack of access to technology. Teachers should be aware of these issues and work to provide support and resources to help these students succeed.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, creating an inclusive and culturally-sensitive learning environment in the Philippines can be challenging, but it is essential for promoting academic success and social equity. Teachers should be aware of the diverse cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic backgrounds of their students and strive to create a safe and supportive learning environment that celebrates diversity and promotes inclusivity.</p><p></p><br />

                            22. how would you compare classroom routines and classroom instructions in japan and the philippines​</h2><br />
                        <p>Japanese' classroom routines and instructions are more based on discipline ways. Young children were taught doing tasks like cleaning, be responsible on environment, etc. While on the other hand, Philippines, SOME of students here doesn't know how to follow instructions. Because of some hard headed Filipinos, it's more hard to discipline people here compared to Japan. Japan were also known as the cleanest country in the world because of the discipline that all people in there have. Though we have our own School Routine like doing flag ceremony, we should be more responsible for our school routines. Discipline is the good attitude. In that way, we won't hear anything about comparing our country to the other. </p><br />

                            23. why lack of access to healthcare is important issue in the philippines</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Access to healthcare is an important issue in the Philippines for numerous reasons. <strong>Firstly</strong>, the country has one of the highest poverty rates in the world, with more than 25% of the population living in extreme poverty. This means that many people lack the financial resources to pay for medical care and health services. <strong>Additionally</strong>, there is a severe shortage of healthcare professionals across the country, particularly in rural areas. This leads to a lack of access to quality healthcare, which can lead to poorer health outcomes. <strong>Finally</strong>, many areas lack infrastructure such as hospitals and clinics, which limits access to care even further. All of these factors mean that access to healthcare is an important issue in the Philippines and one that needs to be addressed.</p><br />

                            24. Site 5 Gender Issues in the Philippines issues in the Philippines classroom and how can we address such issues ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Gender issues are prevalent not just in the Philippines but also in other parts of the world. In the Philippines, some common gender issues in the classroom include gender-based violence, discrimination, and inequality.</p><p>To address such issues, here are some strategies that can be implemented in the classroom.</p><p></p><p><strong>1.Provide gender sensitivity training:</strong> Teachers and school administrators should be provided with gender sensitivity training to ensure that they are aware of the issues that their students may face. This training should cover topics such as gender identity, gender-based violence, and discrimination.</p><p><strong>2.Create a safe space for all students:</strong> The classroom should be a safe space for all students regardless of their gender identity. This can be achieved by promoting respect, tolerance, and acceptance among students. Teachers should also be mindful of their language and avoid using gender stereotypes.</p><p><strong>3.Encourage gender-neutral language:</strong> Teachers should use gender-neutral language in the classroom to avoid reinforcing gender stereotypes. For example, instead of saying "boys and girls," teachers can say "students" or "learners."</p><p><strong>4.Address gender-based violence:</strong> Teachers should be vigilant and take action when they see any form of gender-based violence in the classroom. This can include physical or verbal abuse, sexual harassment, or bullying.</p><p><strong>5.Promote gender equality:</strong> Teachers can promote gender equality in the classroom by providing equal opportunities to all students regardless of their gender. This can include encouraging girls to participate in traditionally male-dominated subjects such as science and technology.</p><p>Overall, addressing gender issues in the classroom requires a multi-faceted approach that involves providing training to teachers, creating a safe space for all students, promoting gender-neutral language, addressing gender-based violence, and promoting gender equality.</p><br />

We are told to wear face masks and keep social distancing yet, citizens aren't following the rules.
