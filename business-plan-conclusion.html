School from Home Should Be Implemented
Homeschooling means learning outside of the public or private school environment which means that the students will study at home. In this time of pandemic disease, the Department of Education is busy on preparing and planning about the school year 2020-2021. Due to the enhanced community quarantine brought by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), many parents are starting to worry about the studies of their children, prompting them to look for other educational options or alternatives that would enable students to continue learning even if schools remain closed. Therefore, school from home should be implemented because of the threat of COVID-19.
First reason why school from home should be implemented is it is an ideal option at this time where everyone is advised to stay at home to curb the pandemic. DepEd Secretary Leonor M. Briones, said that DepEd is carefully studying and
evaluating​its​implementation​for​the​reason​that​homeschooling​follows​a curriculum that is approved by DepEd.
Another reason why school from home should be implemented, is there are parents who don’t want to enroll their children this school year 2020-2021. Seeing that the case of covid-19 is continuously increasing every single day we may infer that they are dreadful about the health of their children.
The above statement shows that the threat of Covid-19 is widespread hence, school from home should be implemented until the vaccine will be out of the market. Since President Rodrigo Roa Duterte sign the new law to adjust the opening of classes instead of August 2020, then the DepEd will have more time planning and preparing a good learning modality for the sake of the students as Briones said that “Education must continue even in times of crisis whether it may be a calamity, disaster, emergency, quarantine, or even war.   pa sagot nmn po kailagan ko na po kase bukas</a>

ACCOUNTING SKILLS By Susan Jacobs I brought with me today some good news and some bad news. The good news is that if you were to open a CPA practice today, you could earn one thousand pesos an hour for your services. The bad news is that you would have to share that with each of your employees. If your business were successful and you had several clients that hourly fee could accumulate to quite a salary, even after deducting your employees' wages. I plan to be a CPA when I graduate from college. I have been working for five years on that degree and I feel that I know some of the skills and abilities that are needed to be a successful CPA. To be a successful accountant, you'll need some skills. I am going to tell you about some of those skills so that you can make sure you possess them when you're ready to start your career These skills are: (1) the ability to communicate, (2) the ability to use your knowledge, and (3) the ability to use computers. 	The most important skill we can possess as accountants is the ability to communicate on an interpersonal level. In a public practice, we will be dealing with clients of all kinds. In my interview with Keith Morrison, a CPA, I learned that our ability to communicate will determine our success or failure in the business world. How well we meet the demands and handle the problems of our clients will decide our fate. 	The communication demands that we will face in business will include oral communication with clients and written communication with certain agencies. In dealing with clients, we will speak with individuals about their tax returns and company representatives about their books. We will also spend time writing to various agencies, such as the Internal Revenue, the Tax Commission, regulatory agencies, and insurance agencies. According to Mr Morrison, the whole objective of the accounting process is to communicate information to the end user. If we can't do that, we're not going to succeed in accounting. 	One of the problems Mr. Morrison runs into is when a client comes in with a problem, but the client isn't sure what the problem is, or she or he isn't quite sure how to explain it We as accountants have to understand the problem before we can help the client. We must be good listeners so that we know which questions to ask By asking the right question, we can figure out the problem. We can waste a lot of time by failing to communicate effectively. The second most important skill is the ability to use the knowledge we have acquired while pursuing our accounting degrees. Mr. Morrison believes that we'll have the knowledge that we need from the courses we are required to take, but whether we can apply that knowledge will depend on our attitude. We must get training and experience in order to apply our knowledge and get the best results. The third most important skill we must have is the ability to use computers in our accounting capacity. A mere familiarity will not be enough. We must be able to deal with computers, function with them, be able to communicate with them in a sense, and be able to get along with them. Programming skills aren't essential, but they would be helpful. They would enable us to be more familiar with the computer. We must feel comfortable with computers and not be afraid of them. We must be able to combine our accounting knowledge with our computer knowledge to master the business application. In conclusion, there is more to being a successful accountant than obtaining a degree. We must be able to communicate with our clients on an interpersonal level. We must be able to get to the root of their problems, and we must be able to communicate to them the information they need whether orally or in writing. We must be able to apply the knowledge we've acquired while pursuing our degrees in order to get the best results from the training and experience we pick up along the way And we must have an understanding of computers and how they function in the business world so that we can combine our accounting with the computer and master the business applications. We must all want to be successful in our careers. We must sharpen our skills and make the most of our knowledge, and we will succeed.ilalagay kopo s taas yung pic ayun po yun dun sasagutan thank you po​</a>

On Small-Scale Farming
by Jhonathan S. Cadavido
Carabaos and cows are important farm animals. [1] (Together with/Similar) other animals, they both help farmers in producing milk and other farm and dairy products. Meat, [2] (namely/for example), is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3] (Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cows produce. [4] (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread or stuffing for varieties of bread [5] (that is/such as) pandesal and loaf bread. [6] (Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we need in our daily lives.
Last year, we had to sell dozens of carabaos and cows for my parents to financially support me with my studies. [7] (As a result/Accordingly), my family recorded and generated small return of investment for that year. [8] (Instead/Although) we suffered a great loss, we still managed to survive with the help of my uncle.
Uncle Romeo has lent us his resources. [9] (On the other hand/Together with) this, he looked for possible investors who would finance our small farm business. [10] (Consequently/Meanwhile), a known dairy company, invested large amount of money to our small-scale farm. We accepted its offer. [11] (In fact/Wherefore), we have already started the expansion of our farm. From 20 remaining cows and carabaos, we now have at least hundreds of them. Our humble farm can now provide a large amount of milk products to our partner-company. [12] (For instance/Henceforth), we can at least supply them 500 liters of milk per day [13] (importantly/notwithstanding) the El Niño phenomenon that we are currently experiencing.
[14] (As a result/Similar) of this success, our family is planning to further expand our business venture, [15] (for example/to demonstrate), production of other farm products from hogs and chicken. [16] (Coupled with/Whereas) our dedication and enthusiasm, our partner-company has pledged to continuously support us in this endeavor. [17] (Comparatively/In fact), we are now working on our feasibility study about this concept. [18] (Consequently/Furthermore), other government policies and bank loans are considered for this project.
[19] (In conclusion/Otherwise), starting a business is not really an easy task, [20] (even more/indeed) a difficult one. [21] (Instead/While) others may not believe in your capacity, it is your duty to trust yourself and the process. With faith and confidence, you will surely achieve your dreams. From carabaos and cows, our small farm will soon be one of the famous haciendas in town producing and delivering quality products and goods.</a>

                                            The Cobra Effect The British colonized India from 1858 to 1947. That means that they ruled the country. They governed the Indian people. They used India to make wealth for the British Empire. But they also developed India. They built canals and railroads. They tried to make India more like the United Kingdom. Yet India was different from the UK. It was more rustic. The ecology was different too. Some British colonists had a hard time adapting. The snakes were particularly troubling. The capital area of Delhi was overrun with venomous cobras. Encountering a cobra is quite frightening. It's even worse getting bit by one. The cobras killed many colonists. Enough died that the British government took action. They paid a bounty for every dead cobra. The program was a success at first. Many people hunted and killed the cobras for the rewards. The number of cobras dropped. The colonists felt safer. But then it became harder to catch cobras. So enterprising people started breeding them. After all, it is easier to catch a pet cobra than a wild one. News of this scheme got back to the British government. They learned that people were breeding cobras to earn rewards. This is not what the British wanted to happen. They felt foolish. They scrapped the program. Now the breeders were angry. Raising cobras can be challenging. They were doing it for the money. When the program ended, the snakes were worthless. So the breeders released them into the wild. Now there were more wild cobras than when the program started. The British plan seemed like a good idea at first. In practice though, it made things much worse. This is the cobra effect. The cobra effect is when a solution worsens a problem. Many well-intentioned programs backfire. In 2014 the City of Chicago banned lightweight plastic bags. Single use bags are bad for the environment. They end up in the water. They pollute the land. City officials wanted people to reuse bags. So they put a tax on lightweight bags. Retailers did not want to anger customers with the new tax. So they made their bags much thicker. The new bags were 150 times thicker than the old bags. The thicker bags were no longer lightweight, so they weren't taxed. But most customers did not reuse these bags. They just threw away the really thick plastic bags. This is another example of the cobra effect. The city intended to reduce plastic waste, yet the tax worsened it 150 fold. Our actions do not always have the consequences that we expect. 1. Which best defines the word colonize as used in the FIRST paragraph? To destroy or ruin a foreign land		C. To trade or do business with other people To inhabit and rule a foreign land		D. To do battle or fight with another group of people 2. Which conclusion can be supported with text from the passage? India had MORE poisonous snakes than the UK.	 India had FEWER poisonous snakes than the UK. India had the SAME amount of poisonous snakes as UK India DID NOT have poisonous snakes. 3. Which event happened LAST? The number of snakes decreased. The government began paying a bounty for dead snakes. The snake breeders released their cobras into the wild. People started breeding snakes.​</a>

                                            My Quarantine Story Donna Teressa M. Oropel It was a busy and ordinary day in March when I heard the news about the spreading virus— which, unfortunately, found to be deadly and dangerous because it attacks the body, specifically the immune system and the respiratory system. After hearing such dispiriting news, I, and the people in my workplace received a piece of advice to take precautionary measures and to stop reporting physically due to the threatening pandemic. It was the time when my Quarantine life started— from predictable and habitual routines to unexpected ones. My days always start with waking up early in the morning, clueless of what to do. I often ask myself, "Is there something productive to do?" Since I was clueless as ever, I started to plan everything out. I began to focus on improving my health by staying fit. I decided to have my daily exercise since my body had not been sweating out lately on account of being too pre-occupied with my job. I also included reading books and enrolling myself in free online classes to feed my intellect and broaden my knowledge. Then, when I have free time, I spoil myself with food, just enough, and with movies by binge-watching on Netflix. My Quarantine life may sound relaxing and fun, but it is not. With the news spreading and circulating on the internet about the increasing cases of people who caught the virus, I could not help but be anxious and sad about it. Many people lost their jobs and businesses— small or large scale, and it led to the extreme poverty of some. With that, every household must watch how they spend their money. Proper budgeting is a must to survive in this crisis. And as for my family, we only buy groceries once a week, and everything is already budgeted; it is not the best time to spend money on nonessentials. Lastly, with everything that is going on, I never forget to pray for the complete healing and safety of everybody. Praying the Holy Rosary is the last thing I do with my family before going to bed.My Quarantine life is not as fun or as exciting as always. However, in conclusion, the experiences I had while staying at home with my family, made me realize and reflect on a lot of things, one of which is the importance of taking good care of my health and appreciate every little time I spend with my loved ones. Life is indeed good, but it is short. It is fun until it is not. Life is unpredictable; we will never know when it will blow its surprise again1. What is the text all about?2.

School from Home Should Be Implemented
Homeschooling means learning outside of the public or private school environment which means that the students will study at home. In this time of pandemic disease, the Department of Education is busy on preparing and planning about the school year 2020-2021. Due to the enhanced community quarantine brought by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), many parents are starting to worry about the studies of their children, prompting them to look for other educational options or alternatives that would enable students to continue learning even if schools remain closed. Therefore, school from home should be implemented because of the threat of COVID-19.
First reason why school from home should be implemented is it is an ideal option at this time where everyone is advised to stay at home to curb the pandemic. DepEd Secretary Leonor M. Briones, said that DepEd is carefully studying and
evaluating​its​implementation​for​the​reason​that​homeschooling​follows​a curriculum that is approved by DepEd.
Another reason why school from home should be implemented, is there are parents who don’t want to enroll their children this school year 2020-2021. Seeing that the case of covid-19 is continuously increasing every single day we may infer that they are dreadful about the health of their children.
The above statement shows that the threat of Covid-19 is widespread hence, school from home should be implemented until the vaccine will be out of the market. Since President Rodrigo Roa Duterte sign the new law to adjust the opening of classes instead of August 2020, then the DepEd will have more time planning and preparing a good learning modality for the sake of the students as Briones said that “Education must continue even in times of crisis whether it may be a calamity, disaster, emergency, quarantine, or even war.   pa sagot nmn po kailagan ko na po kase bukas</h2><br />

                            8. Activity 5. If you have successfully answered the above exercises, then you are ready for a more challenging one. ACCOUNTING SKILLS By Susan Jacobs I brought with me today some good news and some bad news. The good news is that if you were to open a CPA practice today, you could earn one thousand pesos an hour for your services. The bad news is that you would have to share that with each of your employees. If your business were successful and you had several clients that hourly fee could accumulate to quite a salary, even after deducting your employees' wages. I plan to be a CPA when I graduate from college. I have been working for five years on that degree and I feel that I know some of the skills and abilities that are needed to be a successful CPA. To be a successful accountant, you'll need some skills. I am going to tell you about some of those skills so that you can make sure you possess them when you're ready to start your career These skills are: (1) the ability to communicate, (2) the ability to use your knowledge, and (3) the ability to use computers. 	The most important skill we can possess as accountants is the ability to communicate on an interpersonal level. In a public practice, we will be dealing with clients of all kinds. In my interview with Keith Morrison, a CPA, I learned that our ability to communicate will determine our success or failure in the business world. How well we meet the demands and handle the problems of our clients will decide our fate. 	The communication demands that we will face in business will include oral communication with clients and written communication with certain agencies. In dealing with clients, we will speak with individuals about their tax returns and company representatives about their books. We will also spend time writing to various agencies, such as the Internal Revenue, the Tax Commission, regulatory agencies, and insurance agencies. According to Mr Morrison, the whole objective of the accounting process is to communicate information to the end user. If we can't do that, we're not going to succeed in accounting. 	One of the problems Mr. Morrison runs into is when a client comes in with a problem, but the client isn't sure what the problem is, or she or he isn't quite sure how to explain it We as accountants have to understand the problem before we can help the client. We must be good listeners so that we know which questions to ask By asking the right question, we can figure out the problem. We can waste a lot of time by failing to communicate effectively. The second most important skill is the ability to use the knowledge we have acquired while pursuing our accounting degrees. Mr. Morrison believes that we'll have the knowledge that we need from the courses we are required to take, but whether we can apply that knowledge will depend on our attitude. We must get training and experience in order to apply our knowledge and get the best results. The third most important skill we must have is the ability to use computers in our accounting capacity. A mere familiarity will not be enough. We must be able to deal with computers, function with them, be able to communicate with them in a sense, and be able to get along with them. Programming skills aren't essential, but they would be helpful. They would enable us to be more familiar with the computer. We must feel comfortable with computers and not be afraid of them. We must be able to combine our accounting knowledge with our computer knowledge to master the business application. In conclusion, there is more to being a successful accountant than obtaining a degree. We must be able to communicate with our clients on an interpersonal level. We must be able to get to the root of their problems, and we must be able to communicate to them the information they need whether orally or in writing. We must be able to apply the knowledge we've acquired while pursuing our degrees in order to get the best results from the training and experience we pick up along the way And we must have an understanding of computers and how they function in the business world so that we can combine our accounting with the computer and master the business applications. We must all want to be successful in our careers. We must sharpen our skills and make the most of our knowledge, and we will succeed.ilalagay kopo s taas yung pic ayun po yun dun sasagutan thank you po​</h2><br />

C. The scientist works alone in a lab until he makes a dramatic breakthrough and then immediately announces the results through a worldwide press conference.
D. The scientist seeks input and data from a wide range of people of different scientific backgrounds and then publishes all the data and results on the Internet so that all the collaborators can apply it to their individual research.
6. A recent encyclopedia entry about dogs cites multiple research papers done by scientists at veterinary schools. According to the article, Labrador retrievers come in two specific breeds: English and American. The English breed is described as stocky and heavy, while the American breed is described as tall and lanky. The article describes current scientific research as showing that males of both breeds usually weigh about 29-41 kg (65-90 lb), and females weigh 25-32 kg (55-70 lb). Coat colors for both breeds come in solid black, yellow, or chocolate. All labs have strong tails and webbed feet, which help them swim. Devon would like to use this information to determine if his new dog is an English or American Labrador retriever. 
Which best describes the reliability of the information?
A. It is not reliable because only scientists can use scientific information for reference.
B. It is not reliable because it doesn’t talk about how to test and only gives data about the breeds.
C. It is reliable because the article is based on multiple studies done by scientists at multiple veterinary schools.
D. It is reliable because it gives information about both types of Labradors in addition to information about other types of dogs.</h2><br />

On Small-Scale Farming
by Jhonathan S. Cadavido
Carabaos and cows are important farm animals. [1] (Together with/Similar) other animals, they both help farmers in producing milk and other farm and dairy products. Meat, [2] (namely/for example), is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3] (Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cows produce. [4] (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread or stuffing for varieties of bread [5] (that is/such as) pandesal and loaf bread. [6] (Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we need in our daily lives.
Last year, we had to sell dozens of carabaos and cows for my parents to financially support me with my studies. [7] (As a result/Accordingly), my family recorded and generated small return of investment for that year. [8] (Instead/Although) we suffered a great loss, we still managed to survive with the help of my uncle.
Uncle Romeo has lent us his resources. [9] (On the other hand/Together with) this, he looked for possible investors who would finance our small farm business. [10] (Consequently/Meanwhile), a known dairy company, invested large amount of money to our small-scale farm. We accepted its offer. [11] (In fact/Wherefore), we have already started the expansion of our farm. From 20 remaining cows and carabaos, we now have at least hundreds of them. Our humble farm can now provide a large amount of milk products to our partner-company. [12] (For instance/Henceforth), we can at least supply them 500 liters of milk per day [13] (importantly/notwithstanding) the El Niño phenomenon that we are currently experiencing.
[14] (As a result/Similar) of this success, our family is planning to further expand our business venture, [15] (for example/to demonstrate), production of other farm products from hogs and chicken. [16] (Coupled with/Whereas) our dedication and enthusiasm, our partner-company has pledged to continuously support us in this endeavor. [17] (Comparatively/In fact), we are now working on our feasibility study about this concept. [18] (Consequently/Furthermore), other government policies and bank loans are considered for this project.
[19] (In conclusion/Otherwise), starting a business is not really an easy task, [20] (even more/indeed) a difficult one. [21] (Instead/While) others may not believe in your capacity, it is your duty to trust yourself and the process. With faith and confidence, you will surely achieve your dreams. From carabaos and cows, our small farm will soon be one of the famous haciendas in town producing and delivering quality products and goods.</h2><br />

                            18. The Cobra Effect The British colonized India from 1858 to 1947. That means that they ruled the country. They governed the Indian people. They used India to make wealth for the British Empire. But they also developed India. They built canals and railroads. They tried to make India more like the United Kingdom. Yet India was different from the UK. It was more rustic. The ecology was different too. Some British colonists had a hard time adapting. The snakes were particularly troubling. The capital area of Delhi was overrun with venomous cobras. Encountering a cobra is quite frightening. It's even worse getting bit by one. The cobras killed many colonists. Enough died that the British government took action. They paid a bounty for every dead cobra. The program was a success at first. Many people hunted and killed the cobras for the rewards. The number of cobras dropped. The colonists felt safer. But then it became harder to catch cobras. So enterprising people started breeding them. After all, it is easier to catch a pet cobra than a wild one. News of this scheme got back to the British government. They learned that people were breeding cobras to earn rewards. This is not what the British wanted to happen. They felt foolish. They scrapped the program. Now the breeders were angry. Raising cobras can be challenging. They were doing it for the money. When the program ended, the snakes were worthless. So the breeders released them into the wild. Now there were more wild cobras than when the program started. The British plan seemed like a good idea at first. In practice though, it made things much worse. This is the cobra effect. The cobra effect is when a solution worsens a problem. Many well-intentioned programs backfire. In 2014 the City of Chicago banned lightweight plastic bags. Single use bags are bad for the environment. They end up in the water. They pollute the land. City officials wanted people to reuse bags. So they put a tax on lightweight bags. Retailers did not want to anger customers with the new tax. So they made their bags much thicker. The new bags were 150 times thicker than the old bags. The thicker bags were no longer lightweight, so they weren't taxed. But most customers did not reuse these bags. They just threw away the really thick plastic bags. This is another example of the cobra effect. The city intended to reduce plastic waste, yet the tax worsened it 150 fold. Our actions do not always have the consequences that we expect. 1. Which best defines the word colonize as used in the FIRST paragraph? To destroy or ruin a foreign land		C. To trade or do business with other people To inhabit and rule a foreign land		D. To do battle or fight with another group of people 2. Which conclusion can be supported with text from the passage? India had MORE poisonous snakes than the UK.	 India had FEWER poisonous snakes than the UK. India had the SAME amount of poisonous snakes as UK India DID NOT have poisonous snakes. 3. Which event happened LAST? The number of snakes decreased. The government began paying a bounty for dead snakes. The snake breeders released their cobras into the wild. People started breeding snakes.​</h2><br />

                            23. My Quarantine Story Donna Teressa M. Oropel It was a busy and ordinary day in March when I heard the news about the spreading virus— which, unfortunately, found to be deadly and dangerous because it attacks the body, specifically the immune system and the respiratory system. After hearing such dispiriting news, I, and the people in my workplace received a piece of advice to take precautionary measures and to stop reporting physically due to the threatening pandemic. It was the time when my Quarantine life started— from predictable and habitual routines to unexpected ones. My days always start with waking up early in the morning, clueless of what to do. I often ask myself, "Is there something productive to do?" Since I was clueless as ever, I started to plan everything out. I began to focus on improving my health by staying fit. I decided to have my daily exercise since my body had not been sweating out lately on account of being too pre-occupied with my job. I also included reading books and enrolling myself in free online classes to feed my intellect and broaden my knowledge. Then, when I have free time, I spoil myself with food, just enough, and with movies by binge-watching on Netflix. My Quarantine life may sound relaxing and fun, but it is not. With the news spreading and circulating on the internet about the increasing cases of people who caught the virus, I could not help but be anxious and sad about it. Many people lost their jobs and businesses— small or large scale, and it led to the extreme poverty of some. With that, every household must watch how they spend their money. Proper budgeting is a must to survive in this crisis. And as for my family, we only buy groceries once a week, and everything is already budgeted; it is not the best time to spend money on nonessentials. Lastly, with everything that is going on, I never forget to pray for the complete healing and safety of everybody. Praying the Holy Rosary is the last thing I do with my family before going to bed.My Quarantine life is not as fun or as exciting as always. However, in conclusion, the experiences I had while staying at home with my family, made me realize and reflect on a lot of things, one of which is the importance of taking good care of my health and appreciate every little time I spend with my loved ones. Life is indeed good, but it is short. It is fun until it is not. Life is unpredictable; we will never know when it will blow its surprise again1. What is the text all about?2.

DepEd Secretary Leonor M. Briones, said that DepEd is carefully studying and evaluating its implementation for the reason that homeschooling afollowscurriculum that is approved by Dep DepEd.Another reason why school from home should be implemented, is there are parents who don't want to enroll their children this school year 2020-2021. Seeing that the case ofcovid-19 is continuously increasing every single day we may infer that they are dreadfulabout the health of their children.The above statement shows that the threat of Covid-19 is widespread hence, school from home should be implemented until the vaccine will be out of the market. Since President Rodrigo Roa Duterte sign the new law to adjust the opening of classes Instead of August 2020, then the DepEd will have more time plarning and preparing a good learning modality for the saks of the students as Briones said that "Education must continue even in times of crisis whether it may be a calamity, disaster, emergency, quarantine, or even war.​</h2><br />
