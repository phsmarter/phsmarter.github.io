The introduction of social networking sites, in particular, has revolutionized the way we communicate and provided us with an avenue to interact and socialize without having to meet face-to-face with people. 2. Behind all these benefits and advantages, however, lies a myriad of consequences that we often neglect to see. 3. In reality, social networking sites are consuming our lives and daily activities at a rate faster than we can reap their benefits, though some of the adversities may be mitigated through moderation and responsibility. 4. It allow them to continuously socialize with and even meet new people with the same interests, and, not to mention, also keeps them entertained and well-informed with current happenings. 5. Moreover, excessive use of social media distracts us from more important things and activities. 6. Although not immediately visible, social media plays a role in determining a person's mental well-being. 7. Another issue with social networking sites is the fact that it is so liberated that it makes it prone to different risks and crimes. 8. As a result, we, as users of social media, have to be more sensitive and cautions of what we post online in order to prevent harming ourselves or other people. 9. Finally, social media may become a huge distraction to our real lives. 10. All in all, social media is packed with hidden but possibly threatening consequences.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Online games have too much influence on teens.
</p><p>Teenagers today often spend a great deal of time playing video games. These games are fun and engaging and young people often feel like playing games is a great thing to do in their spare time. However, you shouldn’t spend too much time gaming and there are a number of reasons for this: it’s unhealthy, you should spend more time studying, and you need to socialize more.
</p><p>The primary reason to cut down on gaming time has to be that youths that spend a long time on computers and games consoles are often not getting enough exercise. With high obesity rates, it’s very important for young people to spend as much time being active as possible, especially since studies show that people who are overweight during childhood and adolescence are far more likely to become overweight adults than those of a healthy weight when they’re young. There is just as much, if not more, fun to be had in getting out and about and being active. This doesn’t have to mean going for long runs if that’s not your thing; team sports are both fun and great exercise. Dance or fitness classes are also a good option for those not into sports.
</p><p>Secondly, getting a good education is that best thing that you can do for your future. If every teenager cut down on their gaming time by 30 minutes per day and used this time to study, the whole of that generation would achieve better results and be more likely to have the career that they want. With education, you get out what you put in, so it’s really up to you to put in the additional effort. If you want to go to a good college, extra study in your own time will be completely vital, but gaming can reduce your concentration span and make this more difficult.
</p><p>The third main reason that playing video games too often is that it’s no good for your social skills. Some teenagers may argue that because they can now play their games online with friends, they are socializing in their own way. However, you can’t beat face-to-face contact, and if you want to succeed in interviews and build good relationships in later life, you need to develop some proper communication skills. This shouldn’t be a chore, or difficult, because hanging out with friends is far more fun than sitting indoors playing on games all day anyway!
</p><p>In conclusion, there can be no doubt that spending too much time gaming isn’t good for you. You don’t have to stop all together, but it’s all about moderation. Cut down and allocate your additional free time to doing things that are good for you, and you definitely won’t regret it in later life.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:Children should be supervised when using the Internet.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Living in this modern era where everyone relies solely on the internet is a different thing that we all, should pay attention to. Especially when it is the children who are involved in the usage of it, because not all of the informations that we can gather out from it is reliable. Therefore, children will always need to be supervised when using it, for them also to be guided whether what they are looking for is good and appropriate for their ages.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Children nowadays are very fond of using their cellphones to the extent that they almost forget how to live a life without the usage of it, and when we say that children uses their phones, we would really expect that it is associated with the usage of internet, especially knowing that we are in an era where internet hides in every corner. As we all know, internet offers different services for everyone. In that case, children would really love the idea of using it. As what I have mentioned in my first paragraph that not all of the informations that we can get out from the internet is reliable, what I mean is that, we cannot always rely on the internet even if it is always available for all of us. In connection, parents should be the major supervisor of their children, because they’re with them almost 24/7. They should be responsible enough in guiding their children on how to properly use it, because if they fail to do so, there is a tendency that they would also be involved in the problem that may arise due to inappropriate usage of it by their children.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Internet is essential especially nowadays. It plays a vital role for all of us, on a daily basis. Therefore, all of us should be guided on how to properly use it, most especially the children. Parents, along with their children should work hand in hand to make everything safe when using the internet. Educating your children, teaching them proper discipline and making them aware of the things or with the actions that they would be taking would be a big help in order to ensure that they are using internet, properly and correctly.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Title: Children Should Be Supervised When Using the Internet</p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>In today's digital age, the Internet has become an integral part of children's lives, providing them with access to a vast array of information and opportunities for interaction. However, with this increased connectivity comes potential risks and dangers. This essay argues that children should be supervised when using the Internet to ensure their safety, protect their well-being, and promote responsible online behavior.</p><p></p><p>Body Paragraph:</p><p>One of the primary reasons why children should be supervised while using the Internet is to safeguard their safety. The online world is replete with various threats, such as cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and online predators. By providing supervision, parents and guardians can actively monitor their children's online activities, identify potential risks, and take necessary steps to mitigate them. Moreover, supervising children's Internet usage allows for open communication, creating a safe space for discussing any concerns or incidents they may encounter online. Through guidance and supervision, parents can teach children about digital literacy, responsible online behavior, and the importance of protecting their personal information.</p><p></p><p>Another significant aspect of supervising children's Internet usage is ensuring their well-being. Excessive screen time and unrestricted access to the Internet can lead to detrimental effects on children's physical and mental health. By setting boundaries and monitoring their online activities, parents can encourage a healthy balance between digital engagement and other activities, such as physical exercise, social interaction, and creative pursuits. Additionally, supervision allows parents to identify signs of internet addiction or any negative impacts on their children's well-being promptly. With proper supervision, children can develop healthy habits and maintain a positive relationship with technology.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, supervising children's Internet usage is vital in today's digital era. By providing guidance, setting boundaries, and actively monitoring their online activities, parents can ensure their children's safety, protect their well-being, and promote responsible online behavior. Effective supervision empowers children to navigate the online world confidently and equips them with the skills needed to make informed decisions while engaging with digital platforms.</p><br />

                        Answer:<br /><br />1. One of the benefits of using modules for instruction is the acquisition of better self-study or learning skills among students. Students engage themselves in learning the concepts presented in the module. They develop a sense of responsibility in accomplishing the tasks provided in the module. Module learning is effective and beneficial for students for many reasons. Firstly, it can allow students to plan ahead, as they will be fully aware of what topics will be covered in each module, as opposed to just guessing what will be taught next.<br /><br />2. COVID-19 has taken a heavy toll on rural livelihoods. Loss of income and job opportunities were overarching challenges in poor communities in the Philippines. Disaster-prone communities experienced more difficulties in coping with COVID-19 restrictions and its severe economic impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the loss of millions of lives, disrupted the global economy, and created secondary impacts on livelihoods, education, and mental health across the globe. No country or economic group has been immune to the direct impacts of the pandemic, but marginalized communities are particularly vulnerable to the secondary impacts including some public health measures like extended lockdowns.<br /><br />3. Social distancing is not only intended to reduce the total number of people who become infected with COVID-19 but to also help slow its spread, which could ultimately save lives. COVID-19 is a highly contagious viral respiratory infection. SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, spreads mainly through contaminated respiratory droplets that are emitted when infected people cough or sneeze and possibly when they breathe or speak. When these droplets escape the body they may land in a nearby person’s mouth, nose or eyes. They can travel about six feet before settling on a nearby surface. If you touch a contaminated surface then touch your mouth, nose or eyes, you can also become infected. In short, social distancing can help slow the spread of the infection so that public officials and healthcare workers have time to respond effectively to the developing situation.<br /><br />4. Parents may feel more connected to their children's day-to-day education. Parents may better understand what their children are learning. Parents may have a stronger understanding of their children's academic strengths and weaknesses. Disparities in digital literacy and online access among students, teachers, and parents meant that some kids faced big obstacles to just signing on to class. Students from traditionally underserved communities, those with learning disabilities, bilingual learners, and those with mental health conditions had unique challenges and found less access and support during remote learning. Some parents were less well-equipped to help their kids with school than others. Many families needed older kids to take on more household responsibilities or find jobs.<br /><br />— pili ka nalang po ng sagot niyo diyan. pa-brainliest na rin po, salamat :)<br />

                        Online game addiction has become a growing social issue in schools around the world, and my school is no exception. With the widespread availability and accessibility of online games, more and more students are becoming addicted to playing these games, causing detrimental effects on their academic performance, social relationships, and overall well-being. As a concerned student, it is imperative that we address this issue and find appropriate solutions to help those who are struggling with online game addiction.<br /><br />One possible solution to address online game addiction is to increase awareness and education among students, parents, and teachers. By providing information and resources on the potential risks and consequences of excessive online gaming, students can better understand the impact of their behavior and take necessary steps to reduce their gaming time. Moreover, parents and teachers can also monitor and regulate their children's online gaming habits.<br /><br />Another solution is to provide alternative forms of entertainment and activities that promote healthy social interaction and physical exercise. For instance, schools can organize sports events, group activities, and other extracurricular activities that encourage students to engage in healthy and social activities instead of being glued to their screens. Additionally, schools can provide counseling services to help students cope with addiction and provide them with the necessary support and guidance to overcome their addiction.<br /><br />Moreover, online gaming companies should also play a role in addressing this issue by implementing regulations and restrictions to prevent addiction. They can limit the amount of time players spend online, or implement features that encourage users to take breaks and engage in other activities. Furthermore, they can promote healthy gaming practices and encourage users to engage in real-life activities and social interactions.<br /><br />In conclusion, online game addiction is a serious social issue that must be addressed at the school, family, and community level. By increasing awareness, providing alternative forms of entertainment, offering counseling services, and regulating online gaming practices, we can help prevent and reduce the detrimental effects of online game addiction. It is essential that we work together to find appropriate solutions to address this issue and promote healthy habits among our students.<br /><br />Brainliest moto!!<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>In today's digital age, online gaming has become a popular pastime among children and teenagers. While online games can provide entertainment and social interaction, excessive gameplay can lead to addiction, which can negatively impact academic performance, physical health, and social relationships. This essay aims to discuss the issue of online game addiction in schools and propose effective solutions to address it.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>The first step to addressing online game addiction is to educate students and parents about the risks associated with excessive gaming. This can be done through school assemblies, parent-teacher conferences, and online resources that provide information about the signs and symptoms of addiction. Additionally, schools can implement policies that limit access to online games during school hours, such as blocking game sites on school computers.</p><p></p><p>Another solution is to encourage alternative activities that promote physical activity and social interaction. Schools can organize sports events, clubs, and other extracurricular activities that allow students to develop their skills and interests outside of the virtual world. This can help students develop a healthy balance between online gaming and other activities, reducing the likelihood of addiction.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, parents and teachers can collaborate to monitor children's gaming habits and set limits on screen time. Parents can use parental control features on devices to restrict access to certain games or limit the amount of time spent playing games. Teachers can also incorporate gaming time into classroom activities, where students can play educational games that promote learning.</p><p></p><p>In addition, counseling and support groups can be provided to students who are already struggling with online game addiction. These groups can provide a safe space for students to discuss their struggles with peers who are experiencing similar issues. Counselors can also provide individual counseling to help students develop coping strategies and address underlying issues that may contribute to addiction.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, online game addiction is a serious issue that can negatively impact students' academic performance, physical health, and social relationships. By implementing effective solutions such as education, policy changes, alternative activities, parental monitoring, and counseling, schools can help prevent and address online game addiction. It is essential to work collaboratively with parents, teachers, and students to promote healthy habits and balance between online gaming and other activities to achieve a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.</p><br />

                        <p>here are my answers;</p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong>	Children should be supervised when using the Internet. </p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> </strong>Yes, children like me should be supervised by their parents on using the internet. Because nowadays there are tr9lls and people who spread fake news all over the internet. Like for example, parents should limit their kids on using the internet and they should also check what groups they’re joining.. and also checking their conversations with other people because sometimes they could be dangerous and their kids could learn some bad things from it. I agree about them supervising us abut on using the internet because that way, I wont learn some bad things and also I will be safe from knowing all the vulgar things from it.</p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong>   Learning online is just as good as learning in a traditional classroom.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> </strong>My stand on this is neutral. Sometimes it depends on the student’s privileges, like for example, learning online wont be that hard if the student has a reliable internet, good laptop, or gadgets. However, if the student doesn’t have any of this. They’d struggle and the so called ‘learning in a traditional classroom’ will be the best choice for them. So for me learning online would be just as good as learning in a traditional classroom if I have the computer, internet, and gadgets to do so.</p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong>  Social Media's Role during the Quarantine Period </p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> </strong>social media became the source of information during this still ongoing pandemic. It helps when it comes to news, entertainment, and many other things. Because of the quarantine people are only very limited to go out and so , social media became their only source to not feel bored inside their houses. Social media also helps when you need tips about some things for you  and your house. With this it can be said that social media holds a big role for people during the quarantine period.</p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong>  Parents should restrict their children's media exposure.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> </strong>Yes, for me, our parents should restrict us about our exposure to the sócíal médía, because it has a health risk according to the sydney morning rehab. it says there that it has a psychological effect or gives mental health risk to children as they can be victims to cyber bullying and grow up with depression due to it. Parents should restrict and tell us children that social media could be bad for us and also we should always try our best to understand them. </p><p></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong>   Picnicking is a perfect way for families to spend time together.	</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong> </strong>Yes, picknicking is the best way to improve family bonds. Putting up a picnic table with good food in a good location is the best way to relax and chill with your family. Like for example a simple picnic on the park with a family while watching the dog palying is a great experience, plus it will lessen the social media exposure. Children like us wille be exposed more to outdoors activity and we would experience playing outside after a long time with fresh air. So yes picknicking is the best way to spend time together.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Children should be supervised when using the internet.</p><p></p><p>In today's digital age, children have access to the internet from a very young age, and it has become an integral part of their lives. However, it is important for parents and caregivers to supervise their children when they use the internet. The internet can be a dangerous place for children, with risks such as cyberbullying, exposure to inappropriate content, and online predators. Parents need to be aware of these risks and take steps to ensure their children's safety.</p><p></p><p>One way to supervise children's internet use is to use parental controls. Many devices and internet service providers offer parental control features that allow parents to block certain websites or apps and set time limits for internet use. Parents should also talk to their children about internet safety and establish rules for internet use. This can include guidelines such as not sharing personal information online, not talking to strangers online, and reporting any suspicious behavior to a trusted adult.</p><p></p><p>Overall, while the internet can be a valuable tool for learning and entertainment, it is important for children to be supervised when using it. Parents and caregivers have a responsibility to ensure their children's safety online, and should take an active role in monitoring their children's internet use. By using parental controls, establishing rules and guidelines, and talking to their children about internet safety, parents can help ensure their children have a positive and safe experience online.</p><p></p><p>Bibliography:</p><p></p><p>American Academy of Pediatrics.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Effects of Covid 19 Pandemic to the Lives of Filipinos</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The world is in a very devastating situation right now. Millions of people are battling for their lives to survive in this pandemic disease. It's so frustrating that this virus has already taken thousands of lives of people all over the world. Doctors and nurses are trying to save those infected individuals. The government in some infected countries even conducted a lockdown and enhanced community quarantine to stop the spread of this virus. It feels like we are on a war- 'war between humans and the virus'. Instead of using rifles to protect us from the enemy, we are using masks and sanitizers. We don't know when a person is already infected unless being tested. It's so sad and scary to think that in every air we breath, we don't know if it is still safe or it already carries the virus. In every person we communicate personally, he/she might infect us without knowing. The pandemic has huge impact in the lives of filipinos. We are still a developing country and the pandemic is there to pull us down, to make us even poorer.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Learning online has become increasingly popular, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced many schools to switch to remote learning. While some may argue that traditional classroom learning is superior, there is evidence to suggest that online learning is just as effective as traditional learning. Online learning offers greater flexibility, allowing students to learn at their own pace and schedule. Additionally, online learning provides access to a wide range of resources and tools that may not be available in a traditional classroom setting. With the right support and resources, online learning can be just as good as learning in a traditional classroom.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Children should be supervised when using the Internet.</p><p></p><p>Living in this modern era where everyone relies solely on the internet is a different thing that we all, should pay</p><p></p><p>attention to. Especially when it is the children who are involved in the usage of it, because not all of the informations</p><p></p><p>that we can gather out from it is reliable. Therefore, children will always need to be supervised when using it, for</p><p></p><p>them also to be guided whether what they are looking for is good and appropriate for their ages.</p><p></p><p>Children nowadays are very fond of using their cellphones to the extent that they almost forget how to live a life</p><p></p><p>without the usage of it, and when we say that children uses their phones, we would really expect that it is associated</p><p></p><p>with the usage of internet, especially knowing that we are in an era where internet hides in every corner. As we all</p><p></p><p>know, internet offers different services for everyone. In that case, children would really love the idea of using it. As</p><p></p><p>what I have mentioned in my first paragraph that not all of the informations that we can get out from the internet is</p><p></p><p>reliable, what I mean is that, we cannot always rely on the internet even if it is always available for all of us. In</p><p></p><p>connection, parents should be the major supervisor of their children, because they’re with them almost 24/7. They</p><p></p><p>should be responsible enough in guiding their children on how to properly use it, because if they fail to do so, there is</p><p></p><p>a tendency that they would also be involved in the problem that may arise due to inappropriate usage of it by their</p><p></p><p>children.</p><p></p><p>Internet is essential especially nowadays. It plays a vital role for all of us, on a daily basis. Therefore, all of us should</p><p></p><p>be guided on how to properly use it, most especially the children. Parents, along with their children should work</p><p></p><p>hand in hand to make everything safe when using the internet.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Social Media</p><p>Social media is a web browser or a variety of apps that keep people busy by scrolling down or watching new videos. People often find that entertaining and would surf the media without stopping ignoring the time limit.</p><p></p><p>But what people don't realize is that it is affecting their lives, and as well as their mental health. Bullying is wide spreading too, which makes people feel depressed or have trust issues. Because of how depressed a person could be, they could even commit suicide. </p><p></p><p>Not all social media could be bad. It does have a positive side. People often also scroll through them to find news that would make them happy, or something that would brighten up their mood. It is helpful and it does indeed increase your optimism. They could also help in studying or making decisions if you are sitting on a fence. But amongst all, we still have to be aware.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In here, I eventually talked about social media and its side effects</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: Children should be supervised when using the Internet.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Living in this modern era where everyone relies solely on the internet is a different thing that we all, should pay attention to. Especially when it is the children who are involved in the usage of it, because not all of the informations that we can gather out from it is reliable. Therefore, children will always need to be supervised when using it, for them also to be guided whether what they are looking for is good and appropriate for their ages.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Children nowadays are very fond of using their cellphones to the extent that they almost forget how to live a life without the usage of it, and when we say that children uses their phones, we would really expect that it is associated with the usage of internet, especially knowing that we are in an era where internet hides in every corner. As we all know, internet offers different services for everyone. In that case, children would really love the idea of using it. As what I have mentioned in my first paragraph that not all of the informations that we can get out from the internet is</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>reliable, what I mean is that, we cannot always rely on the internet even if it is always available for all of us. In connection, parents should be the major supervisor of their children, because they’re with them almost 24/7. They should be responsible enough in guiding their children on how to properly use it, because if they fail to do so, there is a tendency that they would also be involved in the problem that may arise due to inappropriate usage of it by their children.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Internet is essential especially nowadays. It plays a vital role for all of us, on a daily basis. Therefore, all of us should be guided on how to properly use it, most especially the children. Parents, along with their children should work hand in hand to make everything safe when using the internet. Educating your children, teaching them proper discipline and making them aware of the things or with the actions that they would be taking would be a big help in order to ensure that they are using internet, properly and correctly.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p><p></p><br />
