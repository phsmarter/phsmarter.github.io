Mary Rose Q Cabreros Online Submission 1 (1), 20-42, 2020Language acquisition may come naturally for people without sensorial disabilities. But for deaf children, language acquisition happens differently and comparably delayed than hearing children. This case study made an in- depth inquiry of the communication skills of the Special Education (SPED) students in one of the community colleges in Quezon Province, Philippines. An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</a>

Mary Rose Q Cabreros Online Submission 1 (1), 20-42, 2020Language acquisition may come naturally for people without sensorial disabilities. But for deaf children, language acquisition happens differently and comparably delayed than hearing children.

An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</h2><br />
                        ANSWER:This article highlights the challenges faced by deaf students in acquiring language, specifically in the context of English language learning in the Philippines. The study conducted in one community college in Quezon Province reveals that deaf students struggle with vocabulary, reading comprehension, and making inferences. The results of the study emphasize the importance of addressing the specific needs of deaf students in language learning and the need for additional support and resources to help them succeed.It is inspiring to see that there are efforts being made to better understand the challenges faced by deaf students and to find ways to support their language acquisition. However, it is concerning to see that there are still significant barriers that need to be overcome. This study serves as a reminder of the importance of inclusiveness in education and the need to ensure that all students, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, have equal access to quality education and resources.In conclusion, this article highlights the need for continued research and efforts to support the communication skills of deaf students in the Philippines and beyond. It is important for educators and policymakers to recognize the unique needs of deaf students and to take action to ensure their success in language learning and beyond.<p></p><br />

                            16. Individual Activity 1. Read an example of expository writing and analyze it by answering the questions that follow. I Getting college education in a private school in the Philippines is expensive because of several reasons. First, the college tution fees and miscellaneous fees range from PhP 10,000 to even more than PhP 100,000.00 (depending on the academic program being undertaken). Second, the books are costly. Third, materials like papers, notebooks, and other school and office supplies are also costly. Finally, there are also special fees, like fees for removal examinations or completion of grades. The fees that college students pay seem not only endless, but increasing in prices, as well. Am il a) What is the topic sentence in the above example? b) Does the topic sentence guide and help the reader to know what the paragraph will be about? How does it help the reader? Are there sentences that support the topic sentence? d) Does the closing sentence assist in providing a better understanding of the main idea of the paragraph? e) Do you see transitional words in the lon? If there are, what are these? D) How is the expository paragraph stated, first person, second person, or third person point of view?​</h2><br />

Yes, such as "Getting college education in a private school in the Philippines is expensive because of several reasons."</p><p>d.)  The closing sentence restated the main idea of the topic sentence, so yes.</p><p>e.)

                            17. 1.How did your community culture influence your behavior? Cite one culture in your community and reflect on a particular behavior you have. Discuss how this particular community culture influenced the development of your particular behavior? 2. Watch a special report from ABC News "White Supremacist Move Into Town", video is available in YouTube. This person's actions are consistent with his cultural belief that white people are superior. Would a cultural relativist be correct in maintaining that nobody has the moral basis to complain about the white supremacist's actions because he was just following what he believed was right?3. In the Philippines, one moral argument against RH Law is that it violates universal human rights and values such as the right to life and health of children. On the other hand, proponents of the law assert that family planning and sexual education consistent with one's own beliefs and moral convictions is exercising one's freedom to choose. If the basis of universal values is true and, taking into consideration our social problems due to overpopulation, what is your moral stand on the debate about having a comprehensive reproductive health program in the Philippines? ​</h2><br />

3. Charter Schools Are About Making Choices
"Public charter schools belong to the public schooling system. It means that they follow the accepted teaching standards. These institution must demonstrate the effectiveness of their established methods.
4. At par with the world 
before K to 12 became a law in 2013, Philippines was one of the last three countries in the world that still implement a ten-year basic education program. With this, students finish high school at an average age of 16. This age is not yet employable. Aside from that, students didn't have mastered or specialized  skill that was useful for job-seeking.
