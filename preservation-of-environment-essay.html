                                            ParagraphDirections: Read and understand the paragraphs below, then answer the questions thatfollow. Write them on the second column.Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty tolook at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food,fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, morethan half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! Scientists say that if deforestationcontinues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, andanimals will die.One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. If you use lesspaper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answeris to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists orPhone messages and when you write a rought draft of an essay write on back of.AnswerQuestion1.

                                            Activity 3. A. Read the passage carefully then fill in the blanks below with the needed information taken from the given paragraph: Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees are not just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth's environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, more than half of the world's rain forests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute. Scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world's climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper.You use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. A final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. Most schools, offices, and districts have some kind of recycling center. If you follow the three Rs - reduce, reuse, and recycle,you can help save the world's forests. varagraph.

All of them are feathered, winged, bipedal (meaning: having two legs), egg-laying, warm blooded, vertebrate animals belonging to the class Aves. They are an important part of the ecosystem and are present across the globe from the Arctic to the Antarctic.Birds inhabit the environment that suits them and that is what separates the species found in Polar Regions from those in the Tropical Region. In spite of all the similarities that the bird species share, they have certain unique characteristics which differentiate them from others.Birds may be of different sizes. They could be small as much as 2 inches (e.g. Bee hummingbird) to as big as 2.75 meters (like an Ostrich). Fossil records indicate the emergence of birds to as old as 160 million years ago.Some characteristics of modern birds are feathers, beak, egg-laying, high metabolic rate, four-chambered heart, light weight but strong skeleton. Wings which are actually evolved forelimbs help the birds in their flight. The unique digestive and respiratory system of the birds help them fly to great heights.Some birds cannot fly, penguin is one such species. Certain birds are known to be highly intelligent like parrots and corvids, while some are capable of transmitting knowledge across generations. The way certain birds create very intricately woven and safe nests to preserve their eggs indicates the use of manufacturing skills they possess.Birds are very closely connected with the environment. They are known to be intuitive about weather conditions that may prevail in the region much ahead than humans can predict it with any forecast methods and instruments. Their monitoring and careful examination is also used as an indicator of the weather conditions.Presence of peacock symbolizes rain and good weather while owls, bats and vultures are said to indicate a bad, unpleasant weather in an area. Certain birds are kept near coal mines for the prediction of mine explosion, as birds are sensitive to the release of high levels of carbon monoxide beyond permitted limits and begin to die.Birds are social. Most communication happens through sounds that they make or singing that they do. They live in flocks, hunt, breed cooperatively and participate in social behaviors.Birds incubate the eggs they lay and take longer care of the hatched birds as parents. Birds have the freedom to move anywhere they want and care for no boundaries of political or cultural divide except the suitability of the environment.Many birds have been extinct due to hunting, poaching, disturbed ecological balance and many more are under constant threat of extinction. Even birds living in water like swans, ducks etc. have seen a drastic fall in numbers because of the pollutants like poisonous chemicals and pesticides being constantly added to the water bodies. Also birds living close to the river banks consume polluted water and die.As birds are vital to the balance of this ecosystem, we must take adequate steps to preserve them providing them safe and clean habitat for survival.​</a>

                        <p></p><p></p><p>Industrialization has been the biggest source of pollution. To compensate for the fuel needs, we over exhausted most of the non-renewable resources, like coals, minerals, and oils. In order to save environment, we should switch to eco-friendly energy sources, such as solar power, hydropower, wind energy, etc.</p><p></p><p>It is hard to believe but we don’t always have to do something huge to save environment. Every person, even a child can contribute to the world’s ‘save environment’ goal. We can together do so by reducing the plastic usage, saving electricity, using solar power, and planting more trees in our surroundings. Doing this will not only save environment but also improve the quality of life for both animal and plant species and save them from going extinct.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>" Preservation in our Environment "</strong></p><p><strong>It is critical that our environment remain clean and life-sustaining. This, unfortunately, is not the case. Our actions are harming the environment in which we live. There is an urgent need to take proactive environmental protection measures and involve the younger generation in them.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>There are many ways to improve the condition of the environment, as part of the younger generation, I believe we should practice these ways to help preserve the healthiness of our environment.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Recycle and Reuse</strong></p><p><strong>A large portion of waste that pollutes the environment is made up of dumped household materials that are no longer in use, such as plastic and glass bottles, tin cans, broken computers or other plastic items, clothes, and so on. These waste materials enter the soil and water, where they can pollute and degrade the quality for years. We could do a great deal to save the environment if we just took the simple step of recycling waste instead of throwing it away.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Save Trees</strong></p><p><strong>Trees are the planet's lungs, making them vital members of the environment. They also serve as filters, keeping a location's air quality index high. They consume carbon dioxide and emit oxygen, which is required for life. There is no need to mention the millions of life forms that trees support - birds, insects, reptiles, and so on. The more threes we save, the greater our contribution to environmental health.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Don’t Litter</strong></p><p><strong>How many of you have seen plastic bags, bottles, food packages, and other items littered around beaches, monuments, and market places? Litter is the most harmful to the environment because it rots and pollutes it. The best thing we can do to help the environment is to avoid littering. Make it a habit to properly dispose of waste in a trash can. If you don't see one nearby, keep looking until you do.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Educate and Inspire</strong></p><p><strong>We must educate and raise awareness about the environment and how it can be preserved. Special emphasis should be placed on teaching the young and the children. When young children are taught about the importance of the environment, they will recognize its importance as they grow older. We should also serve as role models for others by planting trees and organizing cleanliness campaigns.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The protection of the environment is in the hands of humans. Only humans can take initiative and save the environment, thereby saving lives on the planet.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>btw ang kyooot ni wonyoung sa pfp mo</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            13. IV. Essay. Write a short paragraph about your role in preserving a healthy environment and how you can help in strengthening resilience to pandemic. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Resilience can help us get through and overcome hardship. But resilience is not something we’re born with—it’s built over time as the experiences we have interact with our unique, individual genetic makeup. That’s why we all respond to stress and adversity—like that from the COVID-19 pandemic—differently. The point where the scale balances is called the “fulcrum,” and if it is more to one side or the other, it can make it harder or easier to tip the resilience scale to the positive. Everyone’s fulcrum is in a different spot—which explains why each person is different in how easily we can counterbalance hardships in life. The good news is that the fulcrum can be moved by developing a toolkit of skills you can use to adapt and find solutions. (More on that later.) We can lighten the load on the negative side of the resilience scale by reducing sources of stress for families and program staff. Many organizations are already doing this and can draw on their experience to prepare for possible future periods of physical distancing and shutdown. Reducing sources of stress may include:
</p><p>
</p><p>Helping families meet basic needs like food, shelter, diapers, health care, child care, and internet access or connecting them with programs that can help
</p><p>Guiding adults who are out of work through applying for financial assistance
</p><p>Creating and providing children’s activity kits that include things like coloring books, crayons and markers, word searches, puzzles, books, craft supplies, etc. to give parents and caregivers a break, even for a few minutes at a time
</p><p>Encouraging parents, program staff, and co-workers to practice self-care—even if it’s just taking a few minutes to themselves, going for a walk, or getting plenty of rest. Make sure staff are aware of and taking advantage of employee benefits such as employee assistance programs, mental health counseling, and paid time off.</p><p></p>Hope It Helps :) Brainlest Pls :) Thanks!<br />

                            14. Activity 3. A. Read the passage carefully then fill in the blanks below with the needed information taken from the given paragraph: Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees are not just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth's environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, more than half of the world's rain forests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute. Scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world's climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper.You use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. A final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. Most schools, offices, and districts have some kind of recycling center.

Create kayo ng outline (either topic outline or sentence outline) based sa essay na ito. :)BirdsBy Pragati GhoshBirds are special kind of animal species with certain specific characteristics that are common to all of them. All of them are feathered, winged, bipedal (meaning: having two legs), egg-laying, warm blooded, vertebrate animals belonging to the class Aves. They are an important part of the ecosystem and are present across the globe from the Arctic to the Antarctic.Birds inhabit the environment that suits them and that is what separates the species found in Polar Regions from those in the Tropical Region. In spite of all the similarities that the bird species share, they have certain unique characteristics which differentiate them from others.Birds may be of different sizes. They could be small as much as 2 inches (e.g. Bee hummingbird) to as big as 2.75 meters (like an Ostrich). Fossil records indicate the emergence of birds to as old as 160 million years ago.Some characteristics of modern birds are feathers, beak, egg-laying, high metabolic rate, four-chambered heart, light weight but strong skeleton. Wings which are actually evolved forelimbs help the birds in their flight. The unique digestive and respiratory system of the birds help them fly to great heights.Some birds cannot fly, penguin is one such species. Certain birds are known to be highly intelligent like parrots and corvids, while some are capable of transmitting knowledge across generations. The way certain birds create very intricately woven and safe nests to preserve their eggs indicates the use of manufacturing skills they possess.Birds are very closely connected with the environment. They are known to be intuitive about weather conditions that may prevail in the region much ahead than humans can predict it with any forecast methods and instruments. Their monitoring and careful examination is also used as an indicator of the weather conditions.Presence of peacock symbolizes rain and good weather while owls, bats and vultures are said to indicate a bad, unpleasant weather in an area. Certain birds are kept near coal mines for the prediction of mine explosion, as birds are sensitive to the release of high levels of carbon monoxide beyond permitted limits and begin to die.Birds are social. Most communication happens through sounds that they make or singing that they do. They live in flocks, hunt, breed cooperatively and participate in social behaviors.Birds incubate the eggs they lay and take longer care of the hatched birds as parents. Birds have the freedom to move anywhere they want and care for no boundaries of political or cultural divide except the suitability of the environment.Many birds have been extinct due to hunting, poaching, disturbed ecological balance and many more are under constant threat of extinction. Even birds living in water like swans, ducks etc. have seen a drastic fall in numbers because of the pollutants like poisonous chemicals and pesticides being constantly added to the water bodies. Also birds living close to the river banks consume polluted water and die.As birds are vital to the balance of this ecosystem, we must take adequate steps to preserve them providing them safe and clean habitat for survival.​</h2><br />
