                        <p></p><p>Body shaming, defined as an inappropriate negative statement and attitudes towards another person weight or size.  It can also reach into discrimination against individuals who may be overweight.  There are negative attitudes and stereotypes in the media and elsewhere towards plus size people.  A backlash against body shaming has resulted in the coming of the term itself in attempts to bring a more positive attitude toward diverse body size and styles (Bodyshaming.org 2012).  There are many people out there working towards putting an end to body shaming as well as the stereotype that goes along with being plus size.  Body shaming is wrong and needs to stop.</p><p>Have you ever heard, or said to yourself, I’m too fat I’m chunky I’m obese I wish I was thinner if only I were smaller, then you have practiced what is known as body shaming, and you’re not alone.  Many things influence this negative image that some have of their body. Body image and self-esteem go hand in hand.  Body image includes how we perceive our bodies visually how we feel about our physical appearance how we think and talk to ourselves about our bodies our sense of how other people view our bodies our sense of our bodies in physical space and our level of connectedness to our bodies. Feeling ashamed about your body is what many people seen as overweight struggle with.  Poor body image increases the risks for extreme weight control behaviors such as extreme dieting exercise compulsion laxative abuse vomiting smoking and the use of non-FDA approved dieting pills. Many people are embracing their body no matter what the scale says.  They are going to extremes to show the positive side of being plus size. Extensive levels of body-shaming can have negative emotional effects, including a reduction in self-esteem and other issues such as eating disorders, anxiety, body dysmorphia and depression. Also, body shaming can lead to serious depression, especially when people feel their body can not meet social criteria.</p><br />

                            9. essay about discrimination against lgbt?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>everyone. But in the Philippines, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) too often find that their schooling experience is marred by bullying, discrimination, lack of access to LGBT-related information, and in some cases, physical or sexual assault. These abuses can cause deep and lasting harm and curtail students’ right to education, protected under Philippine and international law.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, lawmakers and school administrators in the Philippines have recognized that bullying of LGBT youth is a serious problem, and designed interventions to address it. In 2012, the Department of Education (DepEd), which oversees primary and secondary schools, enacted a Child Protection Policy designed to address bullying and discrimination in schools, including on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The following year, Congress passed the Anti-Bullying Law of 2013, with implementing rules and regulations that enumerate sexual orientation and gender identity as prohibited grounds for bullying and harassment. The adoption of these policies sends a strong signal that bullying and discrimination are unacceptable and should not be tolerated in educational institutions.</p><p></p><p></p>Paraphrase mo nalang <br /><br />Over the past decade, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people have made significant legal and political gains in the United States, including the freedom to marry. Despite this progress, federal law does not expressly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in fields like employment, housing, and access to services, and fewer than half of the states offer explicit protections for LGBT people at the state level. Without these protections, LGBT people across the United States lack clear recourse and redress when they are fired, evicted, or refused service because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.<br /><br />Against this backdrop of legal vulnerability, lawmakers who oppose marriage for same-sex couples and recent moves to advance transgender equality have led an anti-LGBT charge, pushing for, and often succeeding in getting, new laws that carve out religious exemptions for individuals who claim that compliance with particular laws interferes with their religious or moral beliefs. While LGBT equality is not the only area where exemptions have been debated—particularly as lawmakers have sought to substantially broaden exemptions related to sexual and reproductive healthcare—this report specifically examines a worrying wave of exemptions being introduced to blunt the recognition of LGBT rights across the United States.<br /><br />The freedom of religion, as well as nondiscrimination, is a significant rights issue, and it is important that governments do not unnecessarily burden the exercise of religious conscience. This is especially important to minority religious groups, whose practices are all too easily trampled on by laws and policies enacted by majorities. But when exemptions to laws to accommodate religious beliefs or practices impinge on the rights of others or core societal values like nondiscrimination, lawmakers should proceed with caution.<br /><br />Proponents of these laws argue that they properly balance religious freedom with the rights of LGBT individuals. In fact, with few exceptions, the laws as drafted create blanket exemptions for religious believers to discriminate with no consideration of or even mechanism for consideration of the harms and burdens on others. Because of their narrow focus on the objector, the laws provide little protection for the rights, well-being, or dignity of those who are turned away.<br /><br />Statements made by legislative supporters of the laws, and in some cases the content of the laws themselves, moreover, make clear that they aim to push back against recent gains toward LGBT equality and to dilute the rights of LGBT people to secure protection from invidious discrimination.<br /><br />Together, the failure of most states to enact nondiscrimination protections and the growing number of religious exemption laws leave many LGBT people with little recourse when they encounter discrimination. While these exemptions are almost always couched in the language of religious freedom or religious liberty, they directly and indirectly harm LGBT people in a variety of ways.<br /><br />The results of this research indicate that the laws already enacted in eight states and the bills still under consideration in many more do not strike a proper balance between the freedom of religion and the equal rights of LGBT people under the law. And in fact, few if any of these laws even represent a serious attempt to do that. Lawmakers at the federal, state, and local level should work to ensure that LGBT people are protected from discrimination in employment, education, housing, healthcare, adoption and foster care, and public accommodations, and should repeal religious exemption laws that give government support to those who would discriminate based on their religious or moral beliefs.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>8 EXAMPLES OF GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA</p><p>Gender Discrimination Examples</p><p>The inception of the United Nations (U.N.) Millennium Goals spearheaded the push towards achieving more social progress by promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women. Despite the fact that two-thirds of the developing world have achieved a level of parity, the problem still persists in the Middle East and North African countries. The lack of access to education, the right to marriage, ownership and custody rights are some very common and debilitating issues that contribute to gender discrimination. However, some of the following examples of gender discrimination shed light on the more uncommon and often overlooked examples of gender inequality.</p><p></p><p>8 Powerful Examples of Gender Discrimination</p><p>1. The Gender Gap</p><p>Developing and developed countries have faced this social issue, although to varying degrees. Women in developed countries still face social hindrances owing to the gender – wage gap – a phenomenon that will still take 188 years to even up, according to the World Economic Forum. Women also have fewer responsibilities and are given fewer rewards for their work.</p><p></p><p>2. Being Forbidden to Drive</p><p>Across many conservative communities in Saudi Arabia, women still face this major social bulwark. Despite it not being a law, women are still not allowed licenses and can only exercise the right to go out in public if accompanied by a chaperon. The Arab Spring in 2011 resulted in a deluge of rallies and protests among women. Even though society is becoming more progressive, especially with regards to allowing women to contribute to the labor force, it will take further social reform to overcome this hindrance.</p><p></p><p>3. Restrictions on Clothing</p><p>Upon the pretext that women should not ‘flaunt their beauty,’ women in many conservative communities have to wear the complete body burqa, coupled with loose-fitting clothes when they are out in public as an interpretative exegesis of the Sharia Law. Many world leaders like U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May have spoken against the issue which is very pervasive in Saudi Arabia, Gambia, Sudan and North Korea.</p><p></p><p>4. Not being Allowed to Travel</p><p>In some extreme cases, women are not allowed to leave the country without the consent of their husbands. Up until the age of 40, single women are required to ask their father for permission. For example, Niloufar Ardalan, the Captain of the Iranian Women’s Soccer team was banned from taking part in the Women’s Futsal Championship of Malaysia in 2015 by her husband as it was in violation of Islamic Law.</p><p></p><p>5. Honor Killing</p><p>This is a deplorable practice that revolves around the hidebound idea that girls have to uphold the supposed ‘cachet’ of their families and abide by the patriarchal demands of the society. Honor killing is largely attributed to the poor education system and ineffective government legislation among rural communities. Consequently, Qandeel Balcoh was killed by her brother Waseem Ali in 2016 because she had supposedly brought dishonor upon her family because of how she expressed herself on social media.</p><p></p><p>6. Female Genital Mutilation</p><p>This problem is prevalent in Sub-Saharan African countries, Egypt and other countries in South Asia due to lack of sex education and awareness. The practice stems from a fundamentalist cultural ideology still held by many traditional communities and based on ensuring a girl’s fidelity before marriage. It is one of the very dire examples of gender discrimination and is a human rights violation. It results in severe pain, difficulties in urination and spread of infection.</p><p></p><p>7. Female Infanticide</p><p>Unfortunately, this practice is rather prevalent among rural communities in India, Pakistan and China. For example, China’s one-child policy has contributed to this issue. Boys are thought to galvanize the financial security of the family, while women are treated as burdens and often seen only as child-bearers and caretakers of the household. In some regions, there are as low as 300 girls for every 1,000 boys. Moreover, Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (Save Girls, Teach Girls) in India, is a social reform initiative that is cracking down on related issues like child marriage.</p><p></p><p>8. Lack of Legal Rights</p><p>This form of gender discrimination is ubiquitous in many countries. From child custody and rape laws, this broad term encompasses many aspects where women are not given enough legal counsel. Spousal rape is not criminalized in many countries and complaints lodged with the police never materialize. In many countries in the Middle East, divorce laws are very weak. The evidence is often not admissible in court and eyewitnesses are always required for cases to be considered.</p><br />

                            14. does the kind of discrimination against women still exist these days? how or in that way</h2><br />
                        <p>Discrimination Exists</p><p>If you don’t believe that discrimination exists, here are some facts that prove my point.</p><p>Race/national origin discrimination: As of July 2011, 13.9 Americans were unemployed. 6.3 million of them were unemployed over 27 weeks. While 8.3 percent of whites are unemployed, compare that to 15.9 percent of African Americans and 11.3 percent for Hispanics. The use of credit history to screen applicants, which is still a widespread practice, can have a disproportionate impact on minorities and women. While some states are making moves to limit discrimination against the unemployed and those with poor credit, we have a long way to go before these practices are eliminated.</p><p>The chance of an African American male born in 2001 of going to jail is 32%. Hispanic males have a 17% chance and white males have a 6% chance. With the extreme disparity in arrest and incarceration rates among the races, EEOC has acknowledged that using arrest and convictions to exclude people from employment may have a disparate impact on minorities. Yet most states still allow criminal records to be used to exclude otherwise qualified applicants, even if the crime had nothing to do with their ability or qualification to perform the particular job.</p><p>Sex discrimination: The wage gap between men and women still stands. Women earn about 77 cents for every dollar men earn. The numbers drop even lower for African American and Hispanic women. Bad attitudes about working mothers abound. Once women have three children or more, they are way less likely to make it back into the workplace. Judges who are supposed to apply the law on pregnancy discrimination describe these cases as “work-life balance” issues and toss them aside. No wonder women who expect they will be easily able to balance working and having kids are suffering from depression.</p><br />

Inilarawan bilang internasyonal na bill ng mga karapatan para sa kababaihan, itinatag ito noong 3 Setyembre 1981 at na-ratify ng 189 na mga estado. Sa loob ng limampung mga bansa na nagpatibay ng Convention ay ginawa ito sa ilalim ng ilang mga deklarasyon, reserbasyon, at pagtutol, kabilang ang 38 bansa na tumanggi sa pagpapatupad ng artikulo 29, na tumutukoy sa paraan ng pag-aayos para sa mga alitan tungkol sa interpretasyon o paggamit ng Convention. Ipinahayag ng deklarasyon ng Australia ang mga limitasyon sa kapangyarihan ng sentral na pamahalaan na nagreresulta mula sa kanyang pederal na sistemang konstitusyunal. Ang Estados Unidos at Palau ay pumirma, ngunit hindi pinatotohanan ang kasunduan. Ang Holy See, Iran, Somalia, Sudan at Tonga ay hindi signatories sa CEDAW.</p><br />
