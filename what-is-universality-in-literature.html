What qualities and attributes did he possess for him to be acknowledged as such by global scholars and experts? Can you cite his most significant contributions in the fields of philosophy, history, literature, science, fine arts, medicine, linguistics, education, etc.?</h2><br />
                        <p>1. <strong>In the history of human civilization, Dr. Jose Rizal became one of the so-called Renaissance men, polymaths, and universal geniuses.</strong></p>He was a Filipino nationalist and one of the few globally-known Renaissance men.A Renaissance man is an intelligent someone who succeeds in multiple topics or fields. Unfortunately, just 28 men in human history are acknowledged. Dr. Jose Rizal is the most recent and final individual in line.Dr. Jose Rizal, the Philippine National Hero, is comparable to Mahatma Gandhi in India. He possesses excellent brains and extraordinary abilities.This Renaissance person was an author, sculptor, painter, educator, farmer, historian and journalist. <p>2. <strong>Dr. Jose Rizal's qualities and attributes did obtain him to be acknowledged as such by global scholars and experts when he was a scholar, scientist, physician, and author, as well as the most eminent influencer. </strong></p>Born in 1861 to an affluent Chinese mestizo family in Laguna Province, he had early signs of exceptional brilliance. He learned to read and write at the age of two and grew up to speak more than twenty languages, including Latin, Greek, French, German, and Chinese.In 1882, after completing three years of medical studies at the University of Santo Tomás, he traveled to Spain to complete his education at the University of Madrid. In the decade that followed, Dr. Jose Rizal's career spanned two worlds: among small communities of Filipino students in Madrid and other European cities, he became a leader and eloquent spokesperson, and in the broader world of European science and scholarship — particularly in Germany — he developed close relationships with prominent natural and social scientists. The new field of anthropology was of great interest to him, and he was determined to refute the friar's preconceived notions of Filipino problems inferiority using scientific evidence.Dr. Jose Rizal's Austrian friend, Professor Ferdinand Blumentritt, rector of the Imperial Atheneum of Leitmeritz, said, "Rizal was the greatest product of the Philippines, and his coming to the world was like the appearance of a rare comet, whose rare brilliance appears only once every century." Dr. Adolf B. Meyer, director of the Dresden Museum, admired Rizal's general knowledge and ability. Dr. Camilo Osias referred to him as a "versatile genius," remarking, "Rizal's multifacetedness was astounding."<p></p><p><strong>3. The most important contributions of Dr. Jose Rizal to the fields of philosophy, history, literature, science, fine arts, medicine, linguistics, and education are as follows:</strong></p><p><strong>- Philosophy</strong></p><p>Dr. Jose Rizal's guiding political thought was the study and application of reforms, the extension of human rights, the training for self-government, and the instigation of discontent over injustice, cruelty, inhumanity, sensitivity, and self-love.</p><p><strong>- History</strong></p><p>Dr. Jose Rizal is one of the most revered figures in the history of the Philippines. His political works fueled the Philippine revolt and eventually led to his execution by the Spanish colonizers. However, he was a multidimensional thinker and political enthusiast.</p><p><strong>- Literature</strong></p><p>He created paintings, sketches, sculptures, and woodcarvings. In addition, he was a prolific poet, essayist, and novelist whose most well-known works were the novels Noli Me Tángere (1887) and El filibusterismo (1900)</p><p><strong>- Science</strong></p><p>He created a vast and well-known medical practice that attracted patients from the Philippines, Hong Kong, and other places in Asia. He developed a hospital. He constructed a small dwelling for himself and a huge one for his family and guests. He acquired land and engaged in scientific farming.</p><p><strong>- Fine arts</strong></p><p>Dr. Jose Rizal was highly adaptable and possessed considerable skills. He created numerous paintings, drawings, and sculptures. Having several sweethearts, he primarily used oil on canvas to create portraits of his name. Additionally, he made some for his pals, including Ferdinand Blummentritt and Juan Luna.</p><p><strong>- Medicine</strong></p><p>In 1887, Dr. Jose Rizal returned to his birthplace and practiced ophthalmology and general medicine for almost one year. His reputation as an eye surgeon mirrored his burgeoning political reputation. Filipinos recognized him as a man of miracles who could restore sight to the blind.</p><p><strong>- Linguistic</strong></p><p>Dr. Jose Rizal's published language studies are a small percentage of his work. However, in his political publications, he utilized language analysis to promote speculations regarding the migrations of Malay peoples in the past and to forward revisionist historical views.</p><p><strong>- Education</strong></p><p>Dr. Jose Rizal advocates education for social advancement. He viewed education as a cornerstone of the critically required reforms.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more information about Dr. Jose Rizal:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/25013234</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><p></p><br />
