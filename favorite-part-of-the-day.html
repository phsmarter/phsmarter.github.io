                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Sure! Here is a table you can use to record your observations of the plant's growth over the two weeks:</p><p></p><p>Day	      Part of Plant	  Observation/s</p><p>Day 5		</p><p>Day 10		</p><p>Day 14		</p><p></p><p>You can fill in the table as you observe the plant each day. For example, on Day 5, you might record observations like:</p><p></p><p>"Leaves are slightly bigger than they were when I first planted the seed"</p><p>"The stem is starting to become thicker"</p><p>"No flowers have appeared yet"</p><p>On Day 10, you could record observations like:</p><p></p><p>"Leaves are now a brighter green"</p><p>"The stem is now visibly thicker"</p><p>"A few buds have appeared"</p><p>On Day 14, you might see:</p><p></p><p>"The leaves are bigger and fuller"</p><p>"The stem has grown taller"</p><p>"Flowers have opened up"</p><p>Please note that this table is a guide and some of the observations you might make may vary from this example. Also the growth of the plant depends on the type of plant you are observing, the conditions (light, water, air etc) you are providing.
