Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

                            1. Write a persuasive essay about the use of social media. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Today everyone is obsessed with social media. People are easily influenced by almost everything they come across on the internet including appearance and body image. In todays generation it is so common to be unhappy with the way you look. All this is due to societies high standards on the way we “should” look. With social media you can do many things, including pretending to be someone you are not. People that are insecure try to find an escape from feeling unhappy with themselves. <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>HOPE IT HELPS <br />

                            2. Make a persuasive Essay about " The impact of social media On society"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON     SOCIETY</strong><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Social media has become an integral part of modern society, changing the way we communicate, share information, and interact with others. While social media has provided many benefits, including increased connectivity and access to information, it has also had a significant impact on society. In this essay, I will argue that the impact of social media on society has been largely negative and that we need to take steps to mitigate these effects.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, social media has been linked to increased levels of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Studies have shown that excessive social media use can contribute to feelings of isolation, low self-esteem, and a sense of inadequacy. This negative impact on mental health can be especially pronounced in vulnerable populations such as teenagers and young adults who are more susceptible to peer pressure and social comparison.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, social media has been a driving force behind the spread of fake news, misinformation, and propaganda. With the ease of sharing and spreading information on social media, it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction. This has led to a growing mistrust of traditional news sources and a lack of critical thinking among the general public.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, social media has been shown to contribute to a decline in face-to-face communication and interpersonal relationships. Instead of interacting with others in person, people are increasingly turning to social media platforms to connect with others, leading to a sense of disconnection and isolation.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the impact of social media on society has been largely negative. It has contributed to mental health issues, the spread of fake news and propaganda, and a decline in interpersonal relationships. We need to take steps to mitigate these effects by encouraging healthy social media use, promoting critical thinking and media literacy, and fostering face-to-face communication and interpersonal relationships. Only then can we reap the benefits of social media while minimizing the negative impact on society.</p><p></p><br />

                            8. Write a Persuasive essay aboutIs social media beneficial or harmful?pa help po need lng​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Social media has become an integral part of modern life. It allows people to connect with others, share information, and express their opinions on a wide range of topics. However, the impact of social media on our society is a topic of intense debate. While some argue that social media is beneficial, others claim that it is harmful. In this essay, I will argue that social media is both beneficial and harmful, but the benefits outweigh the harms.</p><p></p><p>On the one hand, social media has many benefits. First and foremost, it allows people to connect with others who share similar interests and experiences. This can be especially helpful for individuals who may feel isolated or alone. Social media platforms also provide a space for individuals to share their ideas and opinions, which can lead to important conversations and social change. Additionally, social media can be a valuable tool for businesses and organizations to connect with their customers and promote their products and services.</p><p></p><p>However, social media also has its downsides. One of the most significant concerns about social media is its impact on mental health. Studies have found that excessive use of social media can lead to feelings of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Additionally, social media can be a breeding ground for cyberbullying, which can have devastating effects on individuals and communities. Another concern is the spread of misinformation and fake news, which can be harmful to individuals and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>Despite these concerns, I believe that the benefits of social media outweigh the harms. Social media provides a platform for individuals to connect, share their ideas and opinions, and promote positive change. It has the power to bring people together and provide a voice for marginalized communities. Additionally, social media can be used as a tool for education and awareness-raising, helping to spread accurate information and combat misinformation.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while social media has its drawbacks, I believe that it is ultimately beneficial for our society. We must be mindful of the potential harms and work to mitigate them, but we should not dismiss the many benefits that social media provides. By using social media responsibly, we can harness its power to connect with others, promote positive change, and improve our world.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Mark this as a Brainliest if this answer is Helpful.</p><p></p><p>Correct me if I'm wrong.

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</h2><br />
