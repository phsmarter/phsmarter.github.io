</p><p>Most of us have had difficulty coping during the lockdown. We were not emotionally and mentally prepared to cope with the situation. But why? Is it because society has made it a taboo to talk about mental health? Or has mental health received so much stigma for years that no one wants to speak up? It definitely tells us that there was something fundamentally wrong with how we were doing things before the pandemic. I also realized that most of us cannot stand being alone. We depend on external things or situations to make us happy.</p><p></p><p>The planet was able to heal in a short span of time. I realized that nature does not need us to survive but we need nature to survive as a human civilization. We have exploited our natural resources as if they will never run out.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To live a more peaceful life. Remember that, ‘anything that will not provide us peace, is not worth pursuing after’.
</p><p>To have bare minimum expectations needed for survival. This however does not mean that I let go of any luxury that comes my way now and then.
</p><p>To remain sane even when being alone. If we haven’t already, we need to realize that being alone and loneliness are not really the same thing. One can be completely alone and yet not feel lonely. One can be surrounded by people all the time and yet feel lonely.
</p><p>To have complete freedom from any thought patterns or belief systems or ideologies, many a times. Thoughts are an extremely useful tool to solve our day to day problems, at work or home, when used judiciously. When over used or given too much importance when not really needed, it will restrict our mind and hence will never be able to give us total freedom. Thoughts are the breeding ground for anger, fear, hate, jealously, joy, sorrow, pleasure, pain (psychological), depression, anxiety, hatred, happiness, sadness etc.,</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I hope this help you</p><br />

                        <p>The corona virus (also referred to as the COVID-19) pandemic has drastically shaken not just the Philippines, but the world in entirety.  The global economy has seriously lost its peak, and now experiences the greatest fall yet.  The governments have lost their control either.
</p><p>
</p><p>Now that majority of the countries affected by the pandemic have been in lockdown or community quarantine, everybody became immobile and dependent of what the government can provide.  However, looking at the good side of it, this pandemic has led people to be mindful of themselves and everything around them.  We seem immobile just yet, but through this immobility that we are demanded by the government, we actually help in the containment and control of spread of the virus.
</p><p>
</p><p>Since the enhanced community quarantine was upheld, we were able to spend all of our time at home with our respective families.  We have seen the impact of our carelessness, that is our insanitation.  Thus, we are now more mindful of keeping our hygiene with utmost regard.  Moreover, we have been exercising our respect, obedience, and trust with the government in this time of crisis.
</p><p>
</p><p>May we all find this time to reflect on ourselves and on our ways.  May we continue to abide by the laws and ordinances that will help the government, and to finally end the pandemic.  </p><p></p><p>Read the link about community quarantine:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2706554</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />

                        <strong>MY LIFE DURING PANDEMIC</strong><p></p><p>In the start of isolation, as the world dialed back, I could at last invest in some opportunity to unwind, observe a few shows, figure out how to be a superior cook and pastry specialist, and be more dynamic in my extracurriculars. I have a ton of things to be appreciative for. I particularly like that I'm ready to reside in an agreeable house and have gotten the chance to invest more energy with my family. This has really been the first time in quite a while in which all of us are ready to try and eat suppers together each and every day. In any event, when my sibling and I were youthful (family), my folks would be working and now and again return home late, so we didn't dependably eat suppers together. In the start of the quarantine I recollect my family discussing that it was so great to at long last have suppers together, and my sibling kidding, "it just took a pandemic to unite all of us," which I giggled about at that point (yet it's reality).</p><p></p><p>Before sufficiently long, we'll be in every way back to going to better places and we'll be isolated indeed. So I'm grateful for my everyday environment at this moment. Concerning my companions, despite the fact that we're separated, I really do in any case feel like I can be in contact with them through video visit possibly now and then significantly more in contact than previously. I think a many individuals simply possess somewhat more energy for others at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In spite of the fact that there are still a great deal of things to be appreciative for, stress has gradually dominated, and work has been overpowering. I've forever been an individual who normally appreciates going to classes, taking on more work than I need to, and being dynamic overall. Yet, recently I've felt overwhelmed with how much work given, to the point that my days have obscured into online tasks, Zoom classes, and endless gatherings, with a bit of baking desserts and random looking on Youtube. Overall, my life during these occasions is significantly unique in relation to anything the greater part of us have at any point experienced, and now and again it tends to be incredibly overpowering and upsetting particularly as far as school for me. Online classes don't give similar climate and collaborations as in-person classes and are by a wide margin not as agreeable. Yet, toward the day's end, I realize that in each situation there is continually something to be grateful for, and I'm thankful for my circumstance at the present time. While the world has dialed back and my stress has inclined up, I'm gradually starting to change in accordance with it.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>My life as a student during the pandemic? </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/7184885</p><p>#LETSTUDY</p><br />

Consistent with the supercontinent cycle, Pangaea Proxima could occur within the next 200 million years.Pangea Ultima is projected as the next supercontinent 250 million years. If you incorporate the velocities and trajectories of current plate movement, then you can model how continents will evolve.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My God.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people across every state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1] However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right to health fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>According to the World Health Organization’s report Closing the Gap in a Generation: Health Equity through Action on the Social Determinants of Health, “poor and unequal living conditions are the consequences of deeper structural conditions that together fashion the way societies are organized—poor social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics.”[2] This toxic combination of factors as they play out during this time of crisis, and as early news on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic pointed out, is disproportionately affecting African American communities in the United States. I recognize that the pandemic has had and is having devastating effects on other minorities as well, but space does not permit this essay to explore the impact on other minority groups.</p><p></p><p>Employing a human rights lens in this analysis helps us translate needs and social problems into rights, focusing our attention on the broader sociopolitical structural context as the cause of the social problems. Human rights highlight the inherent dignity and worth of all people, who are the primary rights-holders.[3] Governments (and other social actors, such as corporations) are the duty-bearers, and as such have the obligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights.[4] Human rights cannot be separated from the societal contexts in which they are recognized, claimed, enforced, and fulfilled. Specifically, social rights, which include the right to health, can become important tools for advancing people’s citizenship and enhancing their ability to participate as active members of society.[5] Such an understanding of social rights calls our attention to the concept of equality, which requires that we place a greater emphasis on “solidarity” and the “collective.”[6] Furthermore, in order to generate equality, solidarity, and social integration, the fulfillment of social rights is not optional.[7] In order to fulfill social integration, social policies need to reflect a commitment to respect and protect the most vulnerable individuals and to create the conditions for the fulfillment of economic and social rights for all.</p><br />

I’ve always tried to be friendly to everyone I meet, but at the same time I’ve also become picker about who I spend the majority of my time with. I’ve learned to spot certain positive qualities in people, and seek these qualities out. I’ve also learned to avoid other characteristics. The people closest to you will influence you in many ways so I think it’s important to be selective, especially at an important time in your life when you are building the foundation for your career and making other important life decisions. Surround yourself with people who inspire you and make you a better person. Some friends come and go but the ones who have stayed have had a huge impact on my decisions and happiness.

I've realized that life is precious and fragile, and it's important to cherish and make the most of every moment. The pandemic has made me appreciate the simple things in life, such as spending time with loved ones, being healthy, and having a roof over my head. I've also come to understand the importance of self-care and taking time for myself, something I previously took for granted.</p><p></p><p>The pandemic has also had a significant impact on my mental and physical health. With lockdowns and social distancing measures in place, I've struggled with loneliness and isolation. On the other hand, I've also learned to adapt to new ways of working and communicating, and I've become more efficient and organized.</p><p></p><p>Despite the challenges, the pandemic has also brought new opportunities for growth and learning. I've taken up new hobbies, learned new skills, and become more creative. I've also come to appreciate the value of online connections, and I've made new friends from all over the world.</p><p></p><p>To summarize, the pandemic has been a time of self-reflection and realization. It has taught me to appreciate the present moment, to take care of myself, and to find new ways to grow and connect. These lessons will stay with me long after the pandemic is over.</p><p></p><p>- Servion</p><br />
