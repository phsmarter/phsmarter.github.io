                                            Performance Task: Goal: To write a four to six paragraph essay about a crystal of your choice by answering the following questions:1. How is the crystal formed?2. Is it beneficial or harmful to man or both? Discuss how it is beneficial or harmful to man.3. If it is something harmful, what can be done to avoid its formation? If it is something beneficial, how can its formation be promoted? Note: Write your essay on a short bond paper. Cite your sources following the APA format. Choose the crystal from the given list below:a. Oxides of magnesium and calcium produced from hard waterb. Calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate in kidney stonesMY ANSWER(COPY IF YOU WANT)Emerald Synthetic emeralds are referred to as 'created emeralds' and have been produced by flux-growth or hydrothermal processes. In the flux-growth process, crystals are created by dissolving chromium, beryllium and other elements in a molten flux and allowing crystallization to occur on a seed of beryl. Emerald is truly one of the most therapeutic as well as beneficial gemstones that one can ever wear. It can be especially good for people who are finding it difficult to concentrate and focus their work.  The ancient saints and sages have described a lot about the emerald stone benefits, its metaphysical properties and strong healing powers.  They deeply believed that wearing a Panna stone benefits the individual by providing good health, wisdom, prosperity, creative skills and blissful marital life. Emerald is a gemstone and a variety of the mineral beryl (Be3Al2(SiO3)6) colored green by trace amounts of chromium or sometimes vanadium. Beryl has a hardness of 7.5–8 on the Mohs scale. Most emeralds are highly included, so their toughness (resistance to breakage) is classified as generally poor. The color of the gemstone is often used to indicate its authenticity. Hold your gem up to the light and analyze its color. Real emeralds will showcase a pure green or blue-green hue. Hence, if the stone you are holding displays yellow or brown undertones, it is most likely a fake.</a>

Higher order thinking is a natural part of the performance and students exit the stage smarter and more prepared for whatever life has in store for them. Dancers have an edge. Dance matters because it teaches kids to think and respond to the world around them.

                            21. Performance Task: Goal: To write a four to six paragraph essay about a crystal of your choice by answering the following questions:1. How is the crystal formed?2. Is it beneficial or harmful to man or both? Discuss how it is beneficial or harmful to man.3. If it is something harmful, what can be done to avoid its formation? If it is something beneficial, how can its formation be promoted? Note: Write your essay on a short bond paper. Cite your sources following the APA format. Choose the crystal from the given list below:a. Oxides of magnesium and calcium produced from hard waterb. Calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate in kidney stonesMY ANSWER(COPY IF YOU WANT)Emerald Synthetic emeralds are referred to as 'created emeralds' and have been produced by flux-growth or hydrothermal processes. In the flux-growth process, crystals are created by dissolving chromium, beryllium and other elements in a molten flux and allowing crystallization to occur on a seed of beryl. Emerald is truly one of the most therapeutic as well as beneficial gemstones that one can ever wear. It can be especially good for people who are finding it difficult to concentrate and focus their work.  The ancient saints and sages have described a lot about the emerald stone benefits, its metaphysical properties and strong healing powers.  They deeply believed that wearing a Panna stone benefits the individual by providing good health, wisdom, prosperity, creative skills and blissful marital life. Emerald is a gemstone and a variety of the mineral beryl (Be3Al2(SiO3)6) colored green by trace amounts of chromium or sometimes vanadium. Beryl has a hardness of 7.5–8 on the Mohs scale. Most emeralds are highly included, so their toughness (resistance to breakage) is classified as generally poor. The color of the gemstone is often used to indicate its authenticity. Hold your gem up to the light and analyze its color. Real emeralds will showcase a pure green or blue-green hue. Hence, if the stone you are holding displays yellow or brown undertones, it is most likely a fake.</h2><br />

Why Dance Matters: Survival of the Fittest July 12, 2012 By Heather Vaughan-Southard The dance classroom is more than a studio, it is a laboratory. It is the training ground for an unforeseeable future. In the age of standardized testing, arts environments can provide the safe havens where mistakes are treated as discoveries and expression is celebrated. Higher order thinking is a natural part of the performance and students exit the stage smarter and more prepared for whatever life has in store for them. Dancers have an edge. Dance matters because it teaches kids to think and respond to the world around them. Dance education can teach early learners to practice what is usually reserved for older students in other academic subjects. Dance gives the freedom and permission for students to question and explore. "What if?" From a movement strand to composition structure to the study of alignment, the dance class is a constant set of negotiations happening in real time. "What if I send my ribs this way? What if I emphasize the end of the port de bras and not the beginning?" "What if the next movement faced upstage? Students learn theory and apply it immediately. Students assess their own bodies and adjust to find better balance and higher elevations. Goals are immediate, concrete, and progressive. Dance matters because it demands focus.​</h2><br />
