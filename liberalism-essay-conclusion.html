                            1. essay about liberal party​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One of the main reasons for the liberal landslide victory in the 1906 election was their exploitation of conservative mistakes. Joseph Chamberlains’ idea of Tariff reform split the conservative party in half. His scheme of placing higher tariffs on non-empire goods was strongly opposed because free trade had served Britain so well since 1846. A split conservative party was much weaker and it was tariff reform that was largely to blame for Balfours resignation as he failed to bring unity to his party. When the conservative party introduced Free Education in 1891 they lost the non-conformist vote to the liberals. As non-conformists were a sizeable proportion of conservative support, this was a significant loss. As the liberals were campaigning to shut down the religious schools to be funded by the scheme most non-conformist votes went to them. This was Balfours scheme, and he didn’t see it through sufficiently. It was conservatives in power at the time of the boer war, although this war ended in victory the conservative underestimation of the boers cost them. The war occurred because Britain wanted to extract gold from an area of land in South Africa. They did not expect the boers to fight back so well, this made the military look weak, they resorted to burning down houses and killing many people. The conservatives were highly criticised for their treatment of the boers. Due to a shortage of workers at the end of the boer war, the conservative government allowed 50,000 Chinese workers to be sent into South Africa to work in poor conditions for poor pay. The conservatives were heavily criticised for this exploitation of imported workers as well, it was a political scandal and the liberals spoke out against it meaning again they were gaining votes from conservative’s losses. Balfour having allowed this to happen faced outrage towards him and his party. Another factor contributing to the liberal victory was its leadership and party unity. The liberal parties’ organisation had been greatly improved under Herbert Gladstone. Many local associations were revitalised and seats were targeted for the election. Their leader Henry Campbell-Bannerman was a firm believer in free trade, Irish Home Rule and the improvement of social conditions which appealed to non-conformists and other groups alienated by the conservatives. Campbell-Bannermans strong leadership and unified party differed largely from the split and weak conservative party. Liberal leadership was strong, creating policies the public supported and forming alliances such as the Lib-Lab Pact. The Lib Lab pact was a secretive deal formed between liberal and labour. Liberals and LRC made agreement where the Liberals wouldn't oppose Labour candidates in the next General Election in 30 constituencies in England and Wales where a Labour candidate was likely win a seat. In return, the LRC restricted their candidates in other constituencies and so prevent a split in the anti-Tory vote. Doubtful if actually helped Liberals in election but increased size of Conservative defeat.

Rather than organizing solely around belief systems, programmatic manifestos, or party affiliation, identity political formations typically aim to secure the political freedom of a specific constituency marginalized within its larger context. Members of that constituency assert or reclaim ways of understanding their distinctiveness that challenge dominant characterizations, with the goal of greater self-determination.</p><p></p><p>1.

History and Scope</p><p>The second half of the twentieth century saw the emergence of large-scale political movements—second wave feminism, Black Civil Rights in the U.S., gay and lesbian liberation, and the American Indian movements, for example—based in claims about the injustices done to particular social groups. These social movements are undergirded by and foster a philosophical body of literature that takes up questions about the nature, origin and futures of the identities being defended. Identity politics as a mode of organizing is intimately connected to the idea that some social groups are oppressed; that is, that one’s identity as a woman or as African American, for example, makes one peculiarly vulnerable to cultural imperialism (including stereotyping, erasure, or appropriation of one’s group identity), violence, exploitation, marginalization, or powerlessness (Young 1990). Identity politics starts from analyses of such forms of social injustice to recommend, variously, the reclaiming, redescription, or transformation of previously stigmatized accounts of group membership. Rather than accepting the negative scripts offered by a dominant culture about one’s own inferiority, one transforms one’s own sense of self and community. For example, in their germinal statement of Black feminist identity politics, the Combahee River Collective argued that as children we realized that we were different from boys and that we were treated different—for example, when we were told in the same breath to be quiet both for the sake of being ‘ladylike’ and to make us less objectionable in the eyes of white people. In the process of consciousness-raising, actually life-sharing, we began to recognize the commonality of our experiences and, from the sharing and growing consciousness, to build a politics that will change our lives and inevitably end our oppression.

                        <p><strong>answer:</strong></p><p>Buddhism, religion and philosophy that developed from the teachings of the Buddha (Sanskrit: “Awakened One”), a teacher who lived in northern India between the mid-6th and mid-4th centuries BCE (before the Common Era). Spreading from India to Central and Southeast Asia, China, Korea, and Japan, Buddhism has played a central role in the spiritual, cultural, and social life of Asia, and, beginning in the 20th century, it spread to the West.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Buddhist scripture and doctrine developed in several closely related literary languages of ancient India, especially in Pali and Sanskrit. In this article Pali and Sanskrit words that have gained currency in English are treated as English words and are rendered in the form in which they appear in English-language dictionaries. Exceptions occur in special circumstances—as, for example, in the case of the Sanskrit term dharma (Pali: dhamma), which has meanings that are not usually associated with the term dharma as it is often used in English. Pali forms are given in the sections on the core teachings of early Buddhism that are reconstructed primarily from Pali texts and in sections that deal with Buddhist traditions in which the primary sacred language is Pali. Sanskrit forms are given in the sections that deal with Buddhist traditions whose primary sacred language is Sanskrit and in other sections that deal with traditions whose primary sacred texts were translated from Sanskrit into a Central or East Asian language such as Tibetan or Chinese.</p><p></p>The foundations of Buddhism<p></p><p>Buddha.

Test your "enlightenment" in this quiz about Buddha and Buddhism.</p><p>The foundations of Buddhism</p><p>The cultural context</p><p>Buddhism arose in northeastern India sometime between the late 6th century and the early 4th century BCE, a period of great social change and intense religious activity. There is disagreement among scholars about the dates of the Buddha’s birth and death. Many modern scholars believe that the historical Buddha lived from about 563 to about 483 BCE. Many others believe that he lived about 100 years later (from about 448 to 368 BCE). At this time in India, there was much discontent with Brahmanic (Hindu high-caste) sacrifice and ritual. In northwestern India there were ascetics who tried to create a more personal and spiritual religious experience than that found in the Vedas (Hindu sacred scriptures). In the literature that grew out of this movement, the Upanishads, a new emphasis on renunciation and transcendental knowledge can be found. Northeastern India, which was less influenced by Vedic tradition, became the breeding ground of many new sects. Society in this area was troubled by the breakdown of tribal unity and the expansion of several petty kingdoms. Religiously, this was a time of doubt, turmoil, and experimentation.</p><p></p><p><strong>explanation</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong></p><p>hope it helps pa brainliest den po tenchu</p><br />

                        <p>The condition of “fallen” humanity is frequently characterized in the New Testament as “slavery.” It is the slavery of human willfulness that wants to have and enjoy all things for itself: the slavery of alienated love, which is no longer turned toward God but toward one’s own self and the things of this world and which also degrades one’s fellows into the means for egoism and exploitation. The servitude of people fallen away from God is much more oppressive than mere slavery of the senses and of greed for life. It is the enslavement not only of their “flesh” but also of all levels of their being, even the “most spiritual.”</p><br />

                        <p></p><p>My idea of liberalism or a liberal is that they have a liberal point of view and don't feel compelled to adopt the same conventional ways of thinking or doing. By the middle of the nineteenth century, the Whigs in Great Britain had reformed into the Liberal Party, and its reforming policies had set the standard for liberal political parties across Europe. Liberals were the driving force behind the protracted battle that ended slavery in all British dominions in 1833 and the slave trade in Britain in 1807. The Reform Bills of 1832, 1867, and 1884–1885 were the results of the liberal movement to expand the franchise in Britain. British liberalism reached its pinnacle during the 14-year period between 1868 and 1894 under the 14-year leadership of the Liberal Party.</p><p></p><p>:if possible please make this Brainliest &lt;3</p><br />

                            30. why do liberals reject unlimited freedom? which form of equality of liberals' support they reject?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Why do liberals reject unlimited freedom?
</p><p>
</p><p>Freedom is a core theme of liberalism and they believe individual liberty is a supreme political value. Although classical liberal believe liberty is an essential natural right for human existence and modern liberals see liberty as the only condition where people are able fulfil their potential, no liberals accept that individuals have an absolute entitlement to freedom.
</p><p>
</p><p>They believe that unlimited freedom can become a ‘licence’ and give individuals the right to abuse others. This is related to the liberal belief that the individual is egotistical and self-seeking and it may be in the interest of certain individuals to abuse other individuals. Therefore John Mill argued that the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.
</p><p>
</p><p>While liberals agree on the value of liberty, they disagree on what it means for an individual to be free. Classical liberals believe in negative freedom which is the absence of external restrictions or constraints on the individual, allowing freedom of choice. Modern liberals, however, believe in positive freedom which is based on the achievement of autonomy and the development of human capacities.
</p><p>
</p><p>Liberals reject unlimited freedom because they do not believe that a balanced and tolerant society will develop naturally out of the free actions of the individuals. They fear that completely free individuals may wish to exploit others if it is n their interests to do so. Therefore, liberals believe that our liberty requires that others are restrained from encroaching on our freedom and that their liberty is safeguarded from us. This relates back to liberals belief in a liberal state as this protection can only be provided by a sovereign state capable of restraining all individuals and groups within society.</p><p><strong>Explanation: :D</strong></p><p></p><br />
