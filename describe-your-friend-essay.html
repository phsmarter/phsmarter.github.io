Revising a Descriptive Essay e. Editing a Descriptive Essay b. Publishing a Descriptive Essay c. Prewriting for the Descriptive Essay In the prewriting phase of descriptive essay writing, students should take time to think about who or what they want to describe and why. The topic doesn't have to be famous or unusual. The person could be a grandparent, an object, a favorite toy, a place, or a tree house. When creating the initial draft of a descriptive essay, follow the outline, but remember, the goal is to give the reader a rich experience of the subject. In the revision phase. students review, modify, and reorganize their work with the goal of making it the best it can be. In revising a descriptive essay, students should reread their work with these considerations in mind. At this point in the writing process, writers proofread and correct errors in grammar and mechanics. It's also the time to improve style and clarity. Watch out for clichés and loading up on adjectives and adverbs. Having a friend read the essay helps writers see trouble spots and edit with a fresh perspective. Sharing the descriptive essay with the rest of the class can be both exciting and a bit scary. Remember, there isn't a writer on earth who isn't sensitive about his or her own work. The important thing is to learn from the experience and take whatever feedback is given to make the next essay even better.​</h2><br />
