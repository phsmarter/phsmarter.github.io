Committee: General Assembly Topic: Global Warming Country: The Kingdom of Sweden Delegates: ***************** Global warming's effects and influence on the global climate is visible all around us now. As time has passed in the past century, Arctic ice has begun to gradually melt and sea levels have started to rise. If this situation continues, then low-lying island nations such as Vanuatu and Maldives will sink into the sea and will simply disappear. Also, climate is changing in many parts of the world because of global warming. For example, acid rain damaging soils and forests, particularly in our country, serious droughts in Australia, and abnormal weather patterns all over the world. These things are not naturally occurring phenomena - they were caused by human actions. Our nation is addressing global warming on a domestic level. For example, we are separating household waste and recycling as much as we can, and are imposing taxes on CO2 emissions. Out carbon dioxide emissions are 0.4% of the global total. We are raising public awareness of the environmental problems they will face in the future, and we hope that our people will address this issue. But individual nations cannot succeed - the only way to secure our future is if we can get a consensus of nations to take action to reduce these effects. Humans caused this problem and ultimately they must address and deal with it. We must, as global citizens, address this problem actively.

It is such a critical issue that world leaders have met to try and find a workable solution. Unfortunately, no agreement was reached I because everyone had a different point of view. Some people think that nothing we do can change I what is happening, that it is completely natural. On the other hand, others argue strongly that the human impact on the climate over the last hundred years, and the increasing levels of carbon dioxide I into the atmosphere, have had a devastating impact on our environment. Who is right?First, it is important to understand that our climate has always been changing Even today climate change is one of the possible explanations for the extinction of the dinosaurs, millions of years I ago. Likewise, the end of the ice age in prehistoric times was also due to the warming of Earth's l climate. Both of these significant events occurred well before any human Intervention. Others in the scientific community believe that the movement and reactions in the Sun influence our own climate more than we previously realized Solar flares leap out from the Sun and send great bursts of heat I and radiation towards the Earth, causing some changes to our atmosphere. Volcanic eruptions too. I other pollutantsover which ople have absolutely no control, also send huge amounts of gas and also cause changes in regional climates, Human beings areinto the atmosphere. These events I certainly not the only ones who impact upon our environment.​</a>

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

Globalization--Positive or Negative? That isthe question! Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper in lessthan200 words.Bases for rating:Substance - 15 pointsCoherence- 5 pointsRelevance - 5 pointsTotal - 25 pointsFactors related to globalization can also cause workers to migrate from their homelandsin poorer countries to more developed countries to find work. The migrant laborers mayleave their families and live temporarily in another country, thus disrupting the familyand social fabric of their home communities. Furthermore, most of their earnings may besent home, reducing the benefits their employment could have in the country where theyare employed. Often foreign workers immigrate to another country and, because theylive in their own neighborhoods, continue to follow their religions, customs, and evenfollow their own laws, they are sometimes accused of not being willing to adapt andaccept their new country. On the other hand, often these newcomers complain that theyare poorly treated and cannot live the way they would like in the more developedcountries they have immigrated to. Many developing countries need new industries andthe jobs these industries bring to improve their economies through globalization, but theydo not want to lose their own culture and identity in the process. Many developingcountries fear that increased globalization may lead to loss of control over economic andpolitical decisions and may also threaten their traditions, language, and culture. Withthe predominance of American pop culture as well as political and economic influencearound the world, many developing countries see globalization as a form of"Americanization" or "Westernization that is undermining the fabric of their traditionalsocieties. In addition, many developing countries do not have stringent rules aboutenvironmental protection, thus, industries do not need expensive pollution controlequipment, resulting in serious air, water, and soil pollution that would not beacceptable.Commentary: ​</a>

Global warming is the gradual increase in the normal temperature of the earth's climate because the heightened amount of heat energy from the sun striking the earth is being caught up in the atmosphere and not emitted into space. The earth's atmosphere has always accumulated the sun's heat acting like a greenhouse, making sure that the earth maintains temperatures that permit the emergence of life forms as we know them, including humans. Without this greenhouse in the atmosphere, the earth would be freezing. Global warming, however, equates to a greenhouse with highly efficient reflective glass positioned the other way around.

                                            Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

                            1.  You have learned all about globalization and how it affects political processes of our country. Look around you; the foods you eat, the clothes you wear, even the way you talk and interact with other people. How does globalization affect you as an individual? You are going to be a collage-maker today. To make a collage, cut pictures or any images that show the effects of globalization on your life. Paste them on an A4 bond paper. This collage that you are going to make will be shown to your classmates and I hope that through this collage, you will explain how globalization affects your life whether in a positive or a negative way. Aside from this collage, write a brief explanation of your claims about the effects of globalization. Should we continue to adapt to globalization or should we maintain our identity as one nation? Your work will be judged using a rubric below.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Globalization has brought significant changes to our daily lives, from the foods we eat to the clothes we wear and the way we interact with people from different cultures. It has created opportunities for individuals and businesses to connect and trade on a global scale. However, it has also led to cultural homogenization and the loss of unique identities.</p><p></p><p>The collage activity is an excellent way to visualize and reflect on how globalization affects our lives. The images selected can be related to food, fashion, media, technology, and other areas influenced by globalization. The collage can also include pictures of people from different cultures to showcase the diversity brought about by globalization.</p><p></p><p>The brief explanation accompanying the collage should highlight both the positive and negative effects of globalization. It is important to acknowledge the opportunities it has created while also recognizing the challenges it poses to cultural identities and local economies. Ultimately, whether we continue to adapt to globalization or maintain our identity as one nation is a complex and ongoing debate. Finding a balance between embracing global connections and preserving cultural diversity is crucial.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the collage activity and the accompanying explanation can help individuals gain a better understanding of how globalization affects their lives and the world around them. It is an opportunity to reflect on the benefits and drawbacks of globalization and to consider how we can shape its future impact.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Committee: General Assembly Topic: Global Warming Country: The Kingdom of Sweden Delegates: ***************** Global warming's effects and influence on the global climate is visible all around us now. As time has passed in the past century, Arctic ice has begun to gradually melt and sea levels have started to rise. If this situation continues, then low-lying island nations such as Vanuatu and Maldives will sink into the sea and will simply disappear. Also, climate is changing in many parts of the world because of global warming. For example, acid rain damaging soils and forests, particularly in our country, serious droughts in Australia, and abnormal weather patterns all over the world. These things are not naturally occurring phenomena - they were caused by human actions. Our nation is addressing global warming on a domestic level. For example, we are separating household waste and recycling as much as we can, and are imposing taxes on CO2 emissions. Out carbon dioxide emissions are 0.4% of the global total. We are raising public awareness of the environmental problems they will face in the future, and we hope that our people will address this issue. But individual nations cannot succeed - the only way to secure our future is if we can get a consensus of nations to take action to reduce these effects. Humans caused this problem and ultimately they must address and deal with it. We must, as global citizens, address this problem actively.

It is such a critical issue that world leaders have met to try and find a workable solution. Unfortunately, no agreement was reached I because everyone had a different point of view. Some people think that nothing we do can change I what is happening, that it is completely natural. On the other hand, others argue strongly that the human impact on the climate over the last hundred years, and the increasing levels of carbon dioxide I into the atmosphere, have had a devastating impact on our environment. Who is right?First, it is important to understand that our climate has always been changing Even today climate change is one of the possible explanations for the extinction of the dinosaurs, millions of years I ago. Likewise, the end of the ice age in prehistoric times was also due to the warming of Earth's l climate. Both of these significant events occurred well before any human Intervention. Others in the scientific community believe that the movement and reactions in the Sun influence our own climate more than we previously realized Solar flares leap out from the Sun and send great bursts of heat I and radiation towards the Earth, causing some changes to our atmosphere. Volcanic eruptions too. I other pollutantsover which ople have absolutely no control, also send huge amounts of gas and also cause changes in regional climates, Human beings areinto the atmosphere. These events I certainly not the only ones who impact upon our environment.​</h2><br />

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

Globalization--Positive or Negative? That isthe question! Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper in lessthan200 words.Bases for rating:Substance - 15 pointsCoherence- 5 pointsRelevance - 5 pointsTotal - 25 pointsFactors related to globalization can also cause workers to migrate from their homelandsin poorer countries to more developed countries to find work. The migrant laborers mayleave their families and live temporarily in another country, thus disrupting the familyand social fabric of their home communities. Furthermore, most of their earnings may besent home, reducing the benefits their employment could have in the country where theyare employed. Often foreign workers immigrate to another country and, because theylive in their own neighborhoods, continue to follow their religions, customs, and evenfollow their own laws, they are sometimes accused of not being willing to adapt andaccept their new country. On the other hand, often these newcomers complain that theyare poorly treated and cannot live the way they would like in the more developedcountries they have immigrated to. Many developing countries need new industries andthe jobs these industries bring to improve their economies through globalization, but theydo not want to lose their own culture and identity in the process. Many developingcountries fear that increased globalization may lead to loss of control over economic andpolitical decisions and may also threaten their traditions, language, and culture. Withthe predominance of American pop culture as well as political and economic influencearound the world, many developing countries see globalization as a form of"Americanization" or "Westernization that is undermining the fabric of their traditionalsocieties. In addition, many developing countries do not have stringent rules aboutenvironmental protection, thus, industries do not need expensive pollution controlequipment, resulting in serious air, water, and soil pollution that would not beacceptable.Commentary: ​</h2><br />

                            7. Directions: Read the text and answer the following questions in complete sentences. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. Global warming is the gradual increase in the normal temperature of the earth's climate because the heightened amount of heat energy from the sun striking the earth is being caught up in the atmosphere and not emitted into space. The earth's atmosphere has always accumulated the sun's heat acting like a greenhouse, making sure that the earth maintains temperatures that permit the emergence of life forms as we know them, including humans. Without this greenhouse in the atmosphere, the earth would be freezing. Global warming, however, equates to a greenhouse with highly efficient reflective glass positioned the other way around.

                            10. Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.
