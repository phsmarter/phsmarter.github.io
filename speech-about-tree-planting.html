                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Plants and trees are the backbone of our ecosystem. They provide oxygen, food, and shelter to countless species of animals and insects. They also regulate the temperature, absorb harmful pollutants, and prevent soil erosion.</p><p></p><p>In addition, they play a vital role in producing the food we eat. From fruits and vegetables, to grains and nuts, plants are a major source of sustenance for humans and other living beings. They also provide raw materials for many industries, such as textiles, paper, and construction.</p><p></p><p>However, despite their numerous benefits, plants and trees are being threatened by human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and climate change. This not only affects the balance of our ecosystem, but also contributes to the decline of biodiversity, and exacerbates the impacts of climate change.</p><p></p><p>This is why it is our responsibility to protect and conserve the plants and trees in our ecosystem. We can do this by planting more trees, reducing our carbon footprint, and promoting sustainable agriculture practices. We can also support conservation efforts, and raise awareness about the importance of preserving our natural resources.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, plants and trees are essential to our survival and well-being. Let us all work together to protect and preserve them for future generations.</p><br />

                            21. Write a informative speech about tree planting ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Tree planting has seen steady growth in the Philippines<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Today we will talk about tree planting in the Philippines.</p><p>We know that may mountains are now denuded resulting in soil erosion and consequently, flash floods. These are weather events we do not like. These problems also have a very easy solution--stop the cutting of trees. But because they are no longer there, we need to start planting them.</p><p></p><p>EO 26, series of 2010 established the National Greening Program which jump started the massive tree planting we had been doing. In 2014 we even had the world record of planting over 3.2 million trees in an hour as part of the reforestation program. This was a significant number, </p><p></p><p>In 2017, the now Expanded National Greening Program has seen seedling planting activities under the program which covered 187,707 hectares nationwide. The target from 2011 to 2017 was to plant on 1.64 million hectares and we are now at 1.85 million hectares. So far we are doing good and hopefully it is not too late given that extreme weather events are now happening as a result of climate change.</p><p></p><p>Above was an example of an information speech on tree planting. Make sure that when you write an information speech you have the appropriate data on hand so that you can quote the necessary numbers.</p><p></p><p>For more information:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/33391</p><p></p><br />

                            22. make an OWN SPEECH about planting trees TO LESSER  FLOOD.​</h2><br />
                        <p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p></p><p>I stand before you today to talk about an issue that affects us all - flooding. As we all know, floods can cause immense damage to our homes, communities, and the environment. They can disrupt our daily lives, displace families, and even lead to loss of life. However, there is something that we can do to lessen the impact of floods - plant trees.</p><p></p><p>Trees play a crucial role in preventing flooding. They absorb water, reducing the amount of runoff that can cause flash floods. They also slow down the flow of water, allowing it to be absorbed by the ground rather than rushing into our streets and homes. Additionally, trees help to prevent soil erosion, which can make floods worse.</p><p></p><p>In addition to their flood-prevention benefits, trees also provide a host of other benefits. They provide shade and beauty, improve air quality, and provide habitats for wildlife. They can also increase property values and promote community pride.</p><p></p><p>However, planting trees alone is not enough to prevent flooding. We also need to take steps to preserve and protect the trees that we already have. This means protecting our forests and wetlands, and ensuring that new developments are designed with flood prevention in mind.</p><p></p><p>So, I call on all of you to join me in planting trees. Whether it's a tree in your own backyard or a community-wide planting effort, every tree helps. Together, we can make a difference in the fight against flooding.</p><p></p><p>Thank you.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Planting more trees helps to maintain healthy soils and humidity levels in the air around the world. It begins when trees regulate the water cycle. Trees absorb air and transpire it back into the atmosphere, effectively filtering and controlling the levels of humidity wherever they are.</p><br />
