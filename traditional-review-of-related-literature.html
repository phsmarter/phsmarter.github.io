                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Review Related Literature: This expression refers to the process of examining existing literature or scholarly works that are relevant or related to a specific research topic or question. The review may involve analyzing and synthesizing various sources of information, such as academic journals, books, reports, and online resources, to identify key themes, gaps, and debates in the literature. The goal of reviewing related literature is to establish a strong theoretical foundation for the research, to identify research questions or hypotheses, and to situate the research within a broader scholarly context.</p><p></p><p>2. Traditional review of Literature: This expression refers to a type of literature review that is based on a non-systematic or non-structured approach to collecting and analyzing literature. In a traditional review of literature, the researcher may conduct a broad search of relevant literature using general search terms, and then use their own judgment to select and interpret the sources. The traditional review may be subjective and prone to bias, as the researcher's personal perspectives and experiences may influence their selection and interpretation of the literature.</p><p></p><p>3. Systematic review of Literature: This expression refers to a rigorous and structured approach to reviewing literature that involves a systematic search, selection, and analysis of relevant literature according to specific criteria and methods. A systematic review of literature aims to minimize bias and enhance the reliability and validity of the review by using explicit and transparent methods to identify, assess, and synthesize the available evidence. Systematic reviews may involve the use of statistical methods, meta-analysis, or other advanced analytical techniques to synthesize the findings of multiple studies and to provide a comprehensive overview of the research on a specific topic.</p><br />
