Different students attend various types of schools however 
they can usually be classified as either public,private non religous or alternative
 Public schools are funded by the state , and the majority of students in the United
States attend them.Private religous schools are based around a particular faith, such as Catholicism, Judaism, and so forth.
The religion is part of everyday lives of the students and they also learn about the faiths.All types of private schools do not recieve state funding.Therefore, private non religous schools are simply just that :schools which do not recieve state funding and have the ability to make their own rules.
Alternative schools can be made up variety of different categories, such as the Montessori program or technical schools. Most studentes who attend class in an actual school buiding go to one of these types of institutions.</a>

Classification Enumeration Time Order Explanation 1. Different students attend various types of schools; however, they can usually be classified as either public, private religious, private non religious, or alternative. Public schools are funded by the state, and the majority of students in the United States attend them. Private religious schools are based around a particular faith, such as Catholicism, Judaism, and so forth. The religion is part of the every day lives of the students and they also learn about the faiths. All types of private schools do not receive state funding. Therefore, private non religious schools are simply just that: schools which do not receive state funding and have the ability to make their own rules. Alternative schools can be made up of a variety of different categories, such as the Montessori program or technical schools. Most students who attend class in an actual school building go to one of these types of institutions. 2. How to Purify Cloudy Water Boiling is perhaps the safest way to purify cloudy water. You will need a boiling pot, fire, salt, a coffee filter cloth, charcoal and cotton. First, prefilter the cloudy water with a cotton filter or folded cloth. Then, boil the filtered water. Add a small amount of salt to improve the taste of the water as it is boiling. If you are above 2000 feet altitude, boil for three minutes. Next, let the water cool. Meanwhile make a cotton as trap. This will remove impurities and still some bad taste from the boiled water. Finally, filter the boiled water through the cotton trap. 3. Plants are the main source of oxygen. They take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen thereby maintaining environmental balance. Forests are being depleted for many domestic and commercial purposes. This has led to an environmental imbalance, thereby giving rise to global warming.(EXPLENATION: nasa pic yung 4 to 6​</a>

A flipped classroom environment requires complete compliance to the given out-of-class activities thus, self-study. The ability to self-study is a trait of a high performing student therefore making flipped classroom effective to this type of students compared to moderate to low performing students.​</a>

                            14. A. Direction: Identify what kind of text type is the following paragraph. Choose the correct answer in the box. Classification Enumeration Time Order Explanation 1. Different students attend various types of schools; however, they can usually be classified as either public, private religious, private non religious, or alternative. Public schools are funded by the state, and the majority of students in the United States attend them. Private religious schools are based around a particular faith, such as Catholicism, Judaism, and so forth. The religion is part of the every day lives of the students and they also learn about the faiths. All types of private schools do not receive state funding. Therefore, private non religious schools are simply just that: schools which do not receive state funding and have the ability to make their own rules. Alternative schools can be made up of a variety of different categories, such as the Montessori program or technical schools. Most students who attend class in an actual school building go to one of these types of institutions. 2. How to Purify Cloudy Water Boiling is perhaps the safest way to purify cloudy water. You will need a boiling pot, fire, salt, a coffee filter cloth, charcoal and cotton. First, prefilter the cloudy water with a cotton filter or folded cloth. Then, boil the filtered water. Add a small amount of salt to improve the taste of the water as it is boiling. If you are above 2000 feet altitude, boil for three minutes. Next, let the water cool. Meanwhile make a cotton as trap. This will remove impurities and still some bad taste from the boiled water. Finally, filter the boiled water through the cotton trap. 3. Plants are the main source of oxygen. They take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen thereby maintaining environmental balance. Forests are being depleted for many domestic and commercial purposes. This has led to an environmental imbalance, thereby giving rise to global warming.(EXPLENATION: nasa pic yung 4 to 6​</h2><br />
