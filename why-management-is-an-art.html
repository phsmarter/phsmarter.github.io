Do the artwork serves its function/ purpose?how?answer1 Family portraits often aren’t the most exciting pictures to look at, or take. However, the Spanish Old Master Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez, who was born on this day 6 June, 1599, managed to turn one, quite peculiar household portrait into one of the best-loved and most widely analysed paintings in western art history. 2 “One of the most famous and controversial artworks of all time, Las Meninas (The Maids of Honour) is regarded as a dialogue between artist and viewer, with its double mirror imagery and sketchy brushwork that brings every figure and object in the room to life," explains our book, 30,000 Years of Art. "Painters as diverse as Goya, Manet, Sargent and Picasso have been inspired to create copies and adaptations after Velázquez’s masterpiece.” diss answer​</a>

                            7. make a list or reason why management is considered as science or art.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Art implies application of knowledge &amp; skill to trying about desired results. An art may be defined as personalized application of general theoretical principles for achieving best possible results. Art has the following characters -</p><p></p><p>•Practical Knowledge: Every art requires practical knowledge therefore learning of theory is not sufficient. It is very important to know practical application of theoretical principles. To become a good painter, the person may not only be knowing different colour and brushes but different designs, dimensions, situations etc to use them appropriately. A manager can never be successful just by obtaining degree or diploma in management; he must have also know how to apply various principles in real situations by functioning in capacity of manager.</p><p></p><p>•Personal Skill: Although theoretical base may be same for every artist, but each one has his own style and approach towards his job. That is why the level of success and quality of performance differs from one person to another.There are several qualified painters but M.F. Hussain is recognized for his style. Similarly management as an art is also personalized. Every manager has his own way of managing things based on his knowledge, experience and personality, that is why some managers are known as good managers (like Aditya Birla, Rahul Bajaj) whereas others as bad.</p><p></p><p>•Creativity: Every artist has an element of creativity in line. That is why he aims at producing something that has never existed before which requires combination of intelligence &amp; imagination. Management is also creative in nature like any other art. It combines human and non-human resources in useful way so as to achieve desired results. It tries to produce sweet music by combining chords in an efficient manner.</p><p></p><p>•Perfection through practice: Practice makes a man perfect. Every artist becomes more and more proficient through constant practice. Similarly managers learn through an art of trial and error initially but application of management principles over the years makes them perfect in the job of managing.</p><p></p><p>•Goal-Oriented: Every art is result oriented as it seeks to achieve concrete results. In the same manner, management is also directed towards accomplishment of pre-determined goals. Managers use various resources like men, money, material, machinery &amp; methods to promote growth of an organization.</p><p></p><p>Thus, we can say that management is an art therefore it requires application of certain principles rather it is an art of highest order because it deals with moulding the attitude and behavior of people at work towards desired goals.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Management as both Science and Art</p><p>Management is both an art and a science. The above mentioned points clearly reveals that management combines features of both science as well as art. It is considered as a science because it has an organized body of knowledge which contains certain universal truth. It is called an art because managing requires certain skills which are personal possessions of managers. Science provides the knowledge &amp; art deals with the application of knowledge and skills.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>hope it help to you</p><p>pa brainliest po</p><br />

And why people need them? 4 Do you managers should possess some skils different from other employees? Why? If yes list required of managerial skills​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Management is science because of several reasons—it has universally accepted principles, it has cause and effect relationship, etc, and at the same time it is art as it requires perfection through practice, practical knowledge, creativity, personal skills, etc. Management is both art and science</p><p></p><p>2. Managers and organizations are inseparable; like love and marriage they go together. ... You cannot manage unless you have an organization to manage but you can have an organization that is completely unmanageable and you can completely misunder- stand the organization that you do manage.</p><p></p><p>3. An organization is a group of people who work together, like a neighborhood association, a charity, a union, or a corporation. Organization is also the act of forming or establishing something (like an organization). It can also refer to a system of arrangement or order, or a structure for classifying thinks.</p><p></p><p>4.Good managers hold themselves to the highest standards so that their employees will have a clear example of what they should strive for. Integrity, honesty, and professionalism are crucial skills for strong managers. As a leader, it's better to show rather than tell when it comes to work ethic and demeanor.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
