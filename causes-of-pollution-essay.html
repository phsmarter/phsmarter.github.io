Air pollution may be due to a lot of factors, the most common of which are exhaust gases from vehicles, factory gas emissions, and natural events. Exhaust gases from vehicles have continuously dominated the air especially in highly urbanized towns and cities mainly because the government lacks control and citizens prefer convenience to the harmful effects. Likewise, the government has not exercised good control over the location of factories that emit gas elsewhere. More often than not, air pollution is caused by natural events such as forest fires, volcanic eruptions, wind erosion, and pollen dispersal.​</a>

What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains.

______14. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained.

Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</a>

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answers:</strong> Noise pollution- unwanted or excessive sound that can have deleterious effects on human health, wildlife and environmental quality.
</p><p>	It is commonly generated inside many industrial facilities and some other workplaces, but it also comes from highway, railway, and airplane traffic and from outdoor construction activities
. Noise is more than a mere nuisance.  It can cause physical damage to the eardrum and the sensitive hair cells of the inner ears and result in temporary or permanent hearing loss, known as noise-induced hearing loss.  Excessive noise exposure can raise blood pressure and pulse rates; cause   irritability; can anxiety and mental fatigue; and interfere with sleep, recreation and personal communication,  stress, impairments in memory and attention span. Noise pollution control is important in the workplace and in the community.  It can interfere with an animal’s ability to attract mate, communicate, navigate, find food or avoid predators.  It is serious for marine animals.  Noise control ordinances an laws enacted at the local, regional and national levels can be effective.  Low levels of noise may be overcome using additional absorbing material such as heavy drapery or sound absorbent tiles in enclosed rooms; using hearing protectors.</p><br />

Air pollution may be due to a lot of factors, the most common of which are exhaust gases from vehicles, factory gas emissions, and natural events. Exhaust gases from vehicles have continuously dominated the air especially in highly urbanized towns and cities mainly because the government lacks control and citizens prefer convenience to the harmful effects.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Writing paragraphs with cause-and-effect, comparison-and-contrast, and problem-solution relationships involves identifying the relationship between two or more concepts and presenting them in a coherent manner.</p><p></p><p>For a cause-and-effect paragraph, the writer should clearly explain the causes and effects of an event, situation, or trend. There are different patterns or types of cause-and-effect relationships, including single and multiple causes with one or multiple effects, as well as a cause-effect chain. The writer should use transition words and phrases to connect the causes and effects, such as "because," "therefore," "as a result," and "consequently."</p><p></p><p>Here is an example of a cause-and-effect paragraph on air pollution:</p><p></p><p>Air pollution may be due to a lot of factors, the most common of which are exhaust gases from vehicles, factory gas emissions, and natural events.

The paragraph should start with a clear statement of the problem and its impact. The solution should be presented in a logical and organized manner, with supporting evidence and examples. The writer should use transition words and phrases such as "one solution is," "the best approach is," and "to solve this problem" to signal the solution. The paragraph should end with a call to action or a recommendation for the reader.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, writing paragraphs with cause-and-effect, comparison-and-contrast, and problem-solution relationships requires a clear understanding of the concepts being discussed and their interrelationships. The writer should use appropriate transitional words and phrases to guide the reader through the text and provide supporting evidence and examples to enhance their understanding.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Pa brainliest po If my answer are correct for you and Thanks</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>i use Claim-counterclaim</p><p></p><p>Requiring students to wear school uniforms has been a topic of debate among educators, parents, and students for years. Supporters argue that school uniforms promote a sense of unity and equality among students. According to a study conducted by the National Association of Elementary School Principals, schools that require uniforms have seen a decrease in discipline problems and an increase in academic performance. By eliminating the pressure to wear the latest fashion trends, students can focus more on their studies and less on their appearance. Additionally, school uniforms can help level the playing field for students from different socioeconomic backgrounds, as everyone is dressed similarly.</p><p></p><p>However, opponents argue that mandatory school uniforms limit students' self-expression and creativity. Wearing uniforms can stifle individuality and prevent students from expressing their unique personalities. Furthermore, requiring school uniforms can be costly for families, especially those with multiple children. Parents may have to spend more money on clothing to comply with the school's uniform policy, which can be a financial burden. Additionally, enforcing a uniform policy can be a challenge for schools, as they must ensure that students are wearing the correct attire and that the policy is being followed consistently.</p><p></p><p>(if you want to add)</p><p>In conclusion, while requiring students to wear school uniforms may have some benefits, it is important to consider the drawbacks as well. Schools should weigh the potential benefits against the potential costs before implementing a uniform policy. Moreover, if a school does decide to require uniforms, they should ensure that the policy is fair, consistent, and takes into account the financial burden it may place on families.</p><p> </p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>﻿1. A word that is related to noise pollution is called "Cacophony" (Cacophony is a sound that mixed that becomes a noise). Regardless, noise pollution is a harmful sound that must be controlled to make the workplace comfortable. Although we are often surrounded by noise, exposure to noise usually causes less concern than water and air quality issues because they are invisible, tasted, or smelled.</p><p></p><p>2. Clearly, human activities are the cause of noise pollution. Since, noise pollution has a profound impact on human or animal life, most of which are harmful to one or the other. The main sources of external noise around the world are machinery, transportation, and distribution systems.</p><p></p><p>3. Though there are solutions to reduce noise pollution yet people do not do them. But try to do these practices; respect your neighbors right to keep quiet, e.g. Keep your radios, stereos, and tv grew to become down, don't honk horns except if it's an emergency, educate your friends about the dangers of noise.</p><p></p><p>4. This can affect the health of a person. Long-term or excessive exposure to noise has caused a series of health problems, from stress, inattention, decreased work efficiency, communication difficulties and fatigue caused by lack of sleep.</p><p></p><p>(Note: This is my own answer, some of them were searched at go*gle but I rephrase them)</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>sana maaktulong ^^</p><br />

                            21. pls read the essay before you answer.. and highlight this essay, then explain the level of accuracy of the highlighted information you just did.Have you ever listened about global warming? Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</h2><br />

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</h2><br />
