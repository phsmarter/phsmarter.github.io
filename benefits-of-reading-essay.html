                                             Rearrange the following paragraphs by labeling 1-5 to build a strong body of persuasive essay.______a) The main reason which may win most of people's support is that if lack the reading and writing ability, one would be considered as illiterate who has been deprived of the most basic right of human beings in the 21st century. ______b) The second reason I would like to point out is that people today who cannot read and write cannot even make a living. Good jobs are difficult to find because of economic depression.______c) It will be hard for us to imagine how somebody who can't read and write communicates with other people. A case in point is that one of my neighbors who is an old man and cannot read and write may only talk with others face to face. As for making friends by email and search information in newspaper, it is absolutely impossible. ______d) Furthermore, the ability to read and write could bring us lots of advantages. Suppose that people who have tired out with a hard week's sweat and effort may get lots of benefits and relief from reading a short novel and broaden his horizon by appreciating a nice poem. Many friends around me would believe reading and writing some effective ways to relax themselves.______e) Nearly all the jobs require people who can read and write very well. Even if one just plans to be a driver, he must read the road sign and know where he is and where he will go.​</a>

Good jobs are difficult to find because of economic depression.______c) It will be hard for us to imagine how somebody who can't read and write communicates with other people. A case in point is that one of my neighbors who is an old man and cannot read and write may only talk with others face to face. As for making friends by email and search information in newspaper, it is absolutely impossible. ______d) Furthermore, the ability to read and write could bring us lots of advantages. Suppose that people who have tired out with a hard week's sweat and effort may get lots of benefits and relief from reading a short novel and broaden his horizon by appreciating a nice poem. Many friends around me would believe reading and writing some effective ways to relax themselves.______e) Nearly all the jobs require people who can read and write very well.
