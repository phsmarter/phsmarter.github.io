Homeschooling versus face to face learning
It isn't that tough task to mark a difference between traditional or virtual learning because in terms of approach both the mediums of education don’t have major differences. The former that is the face to face learning is the basic form of education wherein the students are present in a real classroom physically interacting with the teachers whereas the latter is the virtual or the online education is the one in which the teacher and the student interact and establish a connection via the internet. The entire coursework  syllabus examinations etc. all remain the same.
Now the question is which education system is the better or which one overshadows the other one. If we look in the current scenario online education today is the need of the hour. However one cannot also brush off the fact that there is an immense shortage of good premium schools where children are taught the fundamentals of education. When they pass out of good institutions their entire personality and their vision are transformed. Especially in underdeveloped countries there is a high scarcity of developed and advanced schools. Not only this but cost also creates hindrances and it `s one of the biggest hurdles in the path of children which eventually deprives them of education. In fact it is one of the biggest factors why online education is much preferred than traditional school education. The lower and the middle-class students are left stranded just because their guardians just cannot afford to pay high tuition fees.
In homeschooling it`s the parents who take the responsibility of educating their children. Irrespective of whether they are qualified or not to teach their children parents to take the responsibility of educating their children with whatever little knowledge or means they have. For these children online education has arisen as a ray of hope. In the online education the students just by using a computer and an internet connection are connected with subject expert teachers who offer them guidance and mentorship in their studies.</a>

                                            A team at the Natural History Museum (NHM), London is paving the way for future rovers to search for meteorites on Mars. The scientists are using the NHM's extensive meteorite collection to test the spectral instruments destined for the ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin, and develop tools to identify meteorites on the surface of the red planet. The project is being presented today (23 July) at the virtual National Astronomy Meeting 2021.The cratered surface of our nearest planetary neighbor has a long and complex history, and searching for rocks amidst more rocks may seem like a futile activity. Despite this, Martian rovers statistically have a significantly higher 'find per mile' success rate than dedicated meteorite hunts on Earth: for every kilometer travelled by a Mars rover, approximately one meteorite is found, even though the rovers have not been specifically looking for them up till now.However, as part of the European Space Agency's upcoming ExoMars mission, the next rover -- named Rosalind Franklin, after the chemist best known for her pioneering work on DNA -- will drill down into the Martian surface to sample the soil, analyze its composition and search for evidence of past or present life buried underground.Meteorites are important pieces of evidence that can help us understand this story; once a meteorite lands on a planet, it is subjected to the same atmospheric conditions as the rest of the surface. Chemical and physical weathering can provide information on climate weathering rates and water-rock interactions, meteorite sizes and distribution can help to infer information about the density of the atmosphere, and stony meteorites could be a potential delivery mechanism for organic materials to Mars."Meteorites act as a witness plate across geological time," said Sara Motaghian, the PhD student at the NHM and Imperial College London who is carrying out the work. "Generally, the surfaces of Mars we are exploring are incredibly ancient, meaning there have been billions of years for the surface to accumulate these meteorites and lock in information from across Mars' past."The team are looking in particular at the use of multispectral imaging with the PanCam instrument, hoping to be able to highlight features in images that could be associated with meteorites as the rover moves across the surface. They are also investigating the possibility of using pattern recognition techniques to distinguish features such as Widmanstätten patterns, which can be revealed by extreme weathering.The launch of the ExoMars rover was originally scheduled for 2020, however was delayed until 2022 due to technical issues and growing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Once the rover reaches Mars in 2023, the team hope that their work will allow meteorites on the surface to be studied for longer by the Rosalind Franklin rover before it drives on, helping to build a more complete understanding of the Martian surface and its history, if any, of life.​</a>

Mr. Osorio is a professor at a prestigious university in Manila. He teaches Ethics to BS Accountancy students. Because of his hard work, his great knowledge on the subject, and his wit and humor, the students very much appreciated him because he makes the class lively and enjoyable. For this reason, he is known as the best teacher in the university. One day, after a class discussion on the topic regarding the value of honesty, three students made an admission in class they were involved in the series of thefts and robberies in the school's canteen and in other offices of the university. Because of the ethics class, the students felt guilty of their actions and promised to the class that they are not to do any acts of robbery anymore. These students told Mr. Osorio about how miserable their lives were and the reason why they robbed the school was because they wanted to cope with the expenses of the school and use some money to buy food for the family. However, because of the great amount that they have taken from the school and the impossibility of paying said amount back to the school, they will definitely be expelled. Expulsion eventually would mean that the three will not anymore be included in the list of graduating students and, therefore, the hope of helping their family financially at the soonest possible time will not be realized. As an ethics teacher, and being professional at that, it is the responsibility of Mr. Osorio to tell the administration about the case. After all, the whole class knows already the case however, as a human person, it will be an act of charity if he will just let it pass by because, after all, they promised that they would not be doing it again. Should Mr. Osorio tell the school administration about the case? Why or why not? Explain your case. ​</a>

                                            irection: Read the situation presented below. Make a moral decision on the dilemma presented below.Mr. Osorio is a professor at a prestigious university in Manila. He teaches Ethics to BSAccountancy students. Because of his hard work, his great knowledge on the subject, and his wit and humor, the students very much appreciated him because he makes the class lively and enjoyable. For this reason, he is known as the best teacher in the university. One day, after a class discussion on the topic regarding the value of honesty, three students made an admission in class they were involved in the series of thefts and robberies in the school's canteen and in other offices of the university. Because of the ethics class, the students felt guilty of their actions and promised to the class that they are not to do any acts of robbery anymore.These students told Mr. Osorio about how miserable their lives were and the reason why they robbed the school was because they wanted to cope with the expenses of the school and use some money to buy food for the family. However, because of the great amount that they have taken from the school and the impossibility of paying said amount back to the school, they will definitely be expelled. Expulsion eventually would mean that the three will not anymore be included in the list of graduating students and, therefore, the hope of helping their family financially at the soonest possible time will not be realized.As an ethics teacher, and being professional at that, it is the responsibility of Mr. Osorio to tell the administration about the case. After all, the whole class knows already the case. However, as a human person, it will be an act of charity if he will just let it pass by because, after all, they promised that they would not be doing it again. Should Mr. Osorio tell the school administration about the case? Why or why not? Explain your case.____________________________________________________________________________​</a>

Homeschooling versus face to face learning
It isn't that tough task to mark a difference between traditional or virtual learning because in terms of approach both the mediums of education don’t have major differences. The former that is the face to face learning is the basic form of education wherein the students are present in a real classroom physically interacting with the teachers whereas the latter is the virtual or the online education is the one in which the teacher and the student interact and establish a connection via the internet. The entire coursework  syllabus examinations etc. all remain the same.
Now the question is which education system is the better or which one overshadows the other one. If we look in the current scenario online education today is the need of the hour. However one cannot also brush off the fact that there is an immense shortage of good premium schools where children are taught the fundamentals of education. When they pass out of good institutions their entire personality and their vision are transformed. Especially in underdeveloped countries there is a high scarcity of developed and advanced schools. Not only this but cost also creates hindrances and it `s one of the biggest hurdles in the path of children which eventually deprives them of education. In fact it is one of the biggest factors why online education is much preferred than traditional school education. The lower and the middle class students are left stranded just because their guardians just cannot afford to pay high tuition fees.
In homeschooling it`s the parents who take the responsibility of educating their children. Irrespective of whether they are qualified or not to teach their children parents to take the responsibility of educating their children with whatever little knowledge or means they have. For these children online education has arisen as a ray of hope. In the online education the students just by using a computer and an internet connection are connected with subject expert teachers who offer them guidance and mentorship in their studies.</a>

Homeschooling versus face to face learning
It isn't that tough task to mark a difference between traditional or virtual learning because in terms of approach both the mediums of education don’t have major differences. The former that is the face to face learning is the basic form of education wherein the students are present in a real classroom physically interacting with the teachers whereas the latter is the virtual or the online education is the one in which the teacher and the student interact and establish a connection via the internet. The entire coursework  syllabus examinations etc. all remain the same.
Now the question is which education system is the better or which one overshadows the other one. If we look in the current scenario online education today is the need of the hour. However one cannot also brush off the fact that there is an immense shortage of good premium schools where children are taught the fundamentals of education. When they pass out of good institutions their entire personality and their vision are transformed. Especially in underdeveloped countries there is a high scarcity of developed and advanced schools. Not only this but cost also creates hindrances and it `s one of the biggest hurdles in the path of children which eventually deprives them of education. In fact it is one of the biggest factors why online education is much preferred than traditional school education. The lower and the middle-class students are left stranded just because their guardians just cannot afford to pay high tuition fees.
In homeschooling it`s the parents who take the responsibility of educating their children. Irrespective of whether they are qualified or not to teach their children parents to take the responsibility of educating their children with whatever little knowledge or means they have. For these children online education has arisen as a ray of hope. In the online education the students just by using a computer and an internet connection are connected with subject expert teachers who offer them guidance and mentorship in their studies.</h2><br />

                            14. A team at the Natural History Museum (NHM), London is paving the way for future rovers to search for meteorites on Mars. The scientists are using the NHM's extensive meteorite collection to test the spectral instruments destined for the ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin, and develop tools to identify meteorites on the surface of the red planet. The project is being presented today (23 July) at the virtual National Astronomy Meeting 2021.The cratered surface of our nearest planetary neighbor has a long and complex history, and searching for rocks amidst more rocks may seem like a futile activity. Despite this, Martian rovers statistically have a significantly higher 'find per mile' success rate than dedicated meteorite hunts on Earth: for every kilometer travelled by a Mars rover, approximately one meteorite is found, even though the rovers have not been specifically looking for them up till now.However, as part of the European Space Agency's upcoming ExoMars mission, the next rover -- named Rosalind Franklin, after the chemist best known for her pioneering work on DNA -- will drill down into the Martian surface to sample the soil, analyze its composition and search for evidence of past or present life buried underground.Meteorites are important pieces of evidence that can help us understand this story; once a meteorite lands on a planet, it is subjected to the same atmospheric conditions as the rest of the surface. Chemical and physical weathering can provide information on climate weathering rates and water-rock interactions, meteorite sizes and distribution can help to infer information about the density of the atmosphere, and stony meteorites could be a potential delivery mechanism for organic materials to Mars."Meteorites act as a witness plate across geological time," said Sara Motaghian, the PhD student at the NHM and Imperial College London who is carrying out the work. "Generally, the surfaces of Mars we are exploring are incredibly ancient, meaning there have been billions of years for the surface to accumulate these meteorites and lock in information from across Mars' past."The team are looking in particular at the use of multispectral imaging with the PanCam instrument, hoping to be able to highlight features in images that could be associated with meteorites as the rover moves across the surface. They are also investigating the possibility of using pattern recognition techniques to distinguish features such as Widmanstätten patterns, which can be revealed by extreme weathering.The launch of the ExoMars rover was originally scheduled for 2020, however was delayed until 2022 due to technical issues and growing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Once the rover reaches Mars in 2023, the team hope that their work will allow meteorites on the surface to be studied for longer by the Rosalind Franklin rover before it drives on, helping to build a more complete understanding of the Martian surface and its history, if any, of life.​</h2><br />

                            15. Direction: Read the situation presented below. Make a moral decision on the dilemma presented below. Mr. Osorio is a professor at a prestigious university in Manila. He teaches Ethics to BS Accountancy students. Because of his hard work, his great knowledge on the subject, and his wit and humor, the students very much appreciated him because he makes the class lively and enjoyable. For this reason, he is known as the best teacher in the university. One day, after a class discussion on the topic regarding the value of honesty, three students made an admission in class they were involved in the series of thefts and robberies in the school's canteen and in other offices of the university. Because of the ethics class, the students felt guilty of their actions and promised to the class that they are not to do any acts of robbery anymore. These students told Mr. Osorio about how miserable their lives were and the reason why they robbed the school was because they wanted to cope with the expenses of the school and use some money to buy food for the family. However, because of the great amount that they have taken from the school and the impossibility of paying said amount back to the school, they will definitely be expelled. Expulsion eventually would mean that the three will not anymore be included in the list of graduating students and, therefore, the hope of helping their family financially at the soonest possible time will not be realized. As an ethics teacher, and being professional at that, it is the responsibility of Mr. Osorio to tell the administration about the case. After all, the whole class knows already the case however, as a human person, it will be an act of charity if he will just let it pass by because, after all, they promised that they would not be doing it again. Should Mr. Osorio tell the school administration about the case? Why or why not? Explain your case. ​</h2><br />

Homeschooling versus face to face learning
It isn't that tough task to mark a difference between traditional or virtual learning because in terms of approach both the mediums of education don’t have major differences. The former that is the face to face learning is the basic form of education wherein the students are present in a real classroom physically interacting with the teachers whereas the latter is the virtual or the online education is the one in which the teacher and the student interact and establish a connection via the internet. The entire coursework  syllabus examinations etc. all remain the same.
Now the question is which education system is the better or which one overshadows the other one. If we look in the current scenario online education today is the need of the hour. However one cannot also brush off the fact that there is an immense shortage of good premium schools where children are taught the fundamentals of education. When they pass out of good institutions their entire personality and their vision are transformed. Especially in underdeveloped countries there is a high scarcity of developed and advanced schools. Not only this but cost also creates hindrances and it `s one of the biggest hurdles in the path of children which eventually deprives them of education. In fact it is one of the biggest factors why online education is much preferred than traditional school education. The lower and the middle class students are left stranded just because their guardians just cannot afford to pay high tuition fees.
In homeschooling it`s the parents who take the responsibility of educating their children. Irrespective of whether they are qualified or not to teach their children parents to take the responsibility of educating their children with whatever little knowledge or means they have. For these children online education has arisen as a ray of hope. In the online education the students just by using a computer and an internet connection are connected with subject expert teachers who offer them guidance and mentorship in their studies.</h2><br />
