Students who are exploring should know the importance of these two, especially in their high school component. </p><p></p><p>For me, the significance of Physics is very undetermined because, without physics, <strong>most of the science topics wouldn't be possible to be taught</strong>. As physics deals with the study of chemistry, energy, biology, and anything that defines it, is a whole <strong>huge part of our science wisdom</strong>. </p><p></p><p>Technology on the other hand is the <strong>same as signified by physics</strong>. Technology, as we all know, is a very important thing especially in the condition of our nation right now wherein almost everything is required to be limited and technology helps us to communicate with each other properly. It's a very significant thing for research, communication, job hunting, and many more. This <strong>makes human life easier.</strong></p><p></p><p>Shortly, I <strong>can't imagine things without these two.</strong> Their significance is a very <strong>valuable thing for humans and our knowledge</strong>. A society without being knowledgeable about physics is too <strong>empty and so is living without technology</strong>. In the near future, I hope we'll have more knowledge about physics and be more edible when it comes to technology, I'm hoping for its advanced changes.</p><p></p><p>- Kylla &lt;3</p><br />

                            11. (help me pleass)ESSAYThe future of the philippines in terms of BPO/ Call center Industrialization​</h2><br />
                        ANSWER:<p></p><p>The Philippines has seen significant growth and development in the business process outsourcing (BPO) and call center industry in recent years, and this trend is likely to continue in the future. The BPO/call center industry has become a major contributor to the Philippine economy, providing employment opportunities for millions of Filipinos and generating billions of dollars in revenue.</p><p></p><p>One of the key factors driving the growth of the BPO/call center industry in the Philippines is the country's large and well-educated labor force. The Philippines has a large pool of English-speaking professionals, many of whom have been trained in business, finance, and other relevant fields. This has made the Philippines an attractive destination for companies looking to outsource their business processes and customer service operations.</p><p></p><p>Another factor that has contributed to the growth of the BPO/call center industry in the Philippines is the country's favorable business environment. The Philippines has a stable and business-friendly government, as well as a well-developed infrastructure, including airports, ports, roads, and telecommunications. This has made it easier for companies to set up operations in the Philippines and to provide high-quality services to their clients.</p><p></p><p>Looking to the future, the BPO/call center industry in the Philippines is likely to continue to grow and evolve. As technology and automation become more advanced, the industry is likely to shift towards higher-skilled and higher-value services, such as data analysis, software development, and other specialized services. This will require companies and workers to adapt and develop new skills and competencies, but it also offers opportunities for further growth and development.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the future of the Philippines in terms of BPO/call center industrialization looks promising, with strong growth prospects and opportunities for further development. As the industry continues to evolve and adapt to changing conditions, it will play an increasingly important role in the Philippine economy and in the lives</p><p></p>___________________<p><strong>Have </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>great </strong><strong>day!</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Give me an 3 paragraph essay about “The children are the fair hope of the future”</h2><br />
                        <p>"The <strong>children</strong> are the <strong>fair hope</strong> of the<strong> future</strong>", said all the elderly people. I think this saying holds a strong meaning but it is so sad that it can only stay as a saying. They would keep on telling the youth that they possess great power in reshaping the future yet nobody ever listens to the young ones. Why? Is it because we haven't experienced what you had? Or is it because the elderly knows best?</p><p></p><p>I believe <strong>society</strong> does not understand how <strong>ironic</strong> the quote can be. Many of the youths go on the streets to fight for freedom, point out the wrongdoings of the greedy, or even do some charity. The strength and motivation that they show always go in vain. I think it's time that we break the cycle of <strong>seniority</strong>. All of us are given a pair of ears from birth. That only means that everybody should listen to each other no matter their age. </p><p></p><p>I hope there would come a time when people acknowledge the truth and what is right upon hearing it. It's tiring how lots of people would twist the truth just because of pride. This is the main reason why it is tiring to become a younger person. I wish generational trauma ends but this needs the cooperation of those with close minds and eccentricity. If society hopes for the children to change the future, I hope the elderly start changing as well.</p><p></p><p>If you would like to learn more about essays, kindly please take your time to visit this link:https://brainly.ph/question/10045947</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                            17. Can you make me an essay wit the theme of "Follow the guide, Tag a career, Like the future"...</h2><br />
                        <p>“Follow the guide, Tag a career, Like the Future”</p><br /><p>This was the theme of <strong>National Career Advocacy Congress</strong>, with the collaborative efforts of the <strong>DOLE. DSWD, DepEd, CHED, TESDA, PRC and DOST</strong>. The program was established to raise concerns of some graduate students having a hard time getting a job, or those who are employed but landed on a different career path.</p><br /><p>Job mismatch is really common in our country. It could be that the person is in a rush to find a job and grab the first application to respond to earn money for the family, or, there really is no vacancy matched for their major and get the available one instead as a starting job.</p><br /><p>However, there are some instances where some will really land to a job that they, even for a little, did not expect to happen, and turned out to be a success in that path. A good example is this: a graduate of Information Technology, dreamt of having a career in programming, however landed in Human Resource Management. The person may have performed well in the HR field, so some companies would offer a proper education and accreditations for that person to be qualified, in terms of credentials, performing HR duties. </p><br /><p>It really is important to love what you do, and chose what you like. For university/college students who have really chosen the right major for them, if you want to have a good career in the future, study harder and aim to get your dream job. For those who are having second thoughts, you still have a choice to shift to the course/major you really like. Follow the guide, follow your choice, and land on the dream job that you’re looking forward to, so that the future will be what you want it to be.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>First, let us discuss what is Literature? It is said to be anything that is written and is considered as an art form and more on significant human experiences. It shows and discusses specific experiences that make us connect to what we are reading and listening to. Literature plays an important role to each person for it creates a new world, opens new ideas and builds confidence and self- healing to anyone who comes to get in touch with it.  Literature played a big role in the development of our society by shaping civilization. Literature puts out a reader in their state of mind then creates a new one wherein the reader becomes one with the emotions of what he or she is reading. It heightens the hunger of people for knowledge. Literature is considered to be the purest of art that is why it should be appreciated by people. Without literature, the world will be a big ball of ignorance and lack of knowledge. People experience many trials and challenges and not being able to share them is very sad and lonely but because of literature, we can greatly express ourselves through writing and sharing of thoughts. A simple poem or letter or note posted or written is already considered literature. Having been able to express one's thoughts is quite a great gift. Something that we can be proud of. </p><p>The role of literature in society is to help enhance our way of thinking and perceiving what is happening around us. It increases our level of expression and speaking, of sharing our thoughts. We become expressive of our thoughts and very much precise with the emotions that are burning inside.  We get to see ourselves in each book, or movie that we watch and that is because we mirror ourselves in it. #BrainlyFast</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>TO WRITE IS RIGHT</strong></p><p>     Writing is one of the most important form of art. Just like painting, music, and tradition, it preserves the memories and ideas you want to leave behind. It enlightens, inspires, and ignites the imagination of the readers. </p><p>     As the world continues to modernize, the engagement of the youth in the present relies more on technology. Most of the things they do is digitalized, however is not a bad thing, only it slowly detached us to the way people lived before. In the past, writing takes a lot of effort with few and costly resources to produce an output--from stones and walls; to quill, ink, and parchment; until we have pen and papers that is within our reach. Nevertheless, availability and interest is indirectly proportional, present youth are drawn to make or watch videos, animation, and any graphic related activities, and writing is not fun and interactive. Yet it is not, writing is a way to discover oneself, deep dive on personal ideas with the interaction of our own mind. Writing encourages critical thinking that is essential to the actual world.</p><p>     Generally, writing will never be out of trend. We have variety of materials to make writing possible, it only needs an effort and willingness to make it happen. It is one of the legacies of the present youth that will become a past to the future generation of youth.</p><br />
