                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Schedule I drugs are those prescription drugs that have a high potential for drug abuse and overuse. Currently these drugs, which include heroin and marijuana, have no accepted medical use. Schedule II drugs are narcotics such as morphine, opium, and fentanyl may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.</p><p>It's the negative effects of the drug to the person that makes doctors shy away from prescribing these medications, except in scenarios when the benefit of having the patients take them clearly outweigh the potential or abuse and psychological dependence. The human body can only do so much in processing and detoxifying these harmful substances and that's the reason why doctors do everything they can to veer away from prescribing them.</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p></p><br />

                        Answer:<p>Significant figures are important because they indicate the degree of accuracy on every calculation specially if it requires a high precision regarding the minimum amount by which a quantity is distinguished to be different from a similar amount.</p><p></p><p>For example, a chemist would like to get how much more chemical solution in milliliters are required to be distributed among the seven samples on a test tube. So he divided 25.3 milliliters into 7 equal parts. (25.3 / 7) the result would be 3.6142857142857142857142857142857 milliliters from a calculator. So instead of listing every resulting digits, he just simply noted 3.61 milliliters more of the solution is needed to be distributed among the 7 test tubes.</p><p></p>#CarryOnLearning<br />
