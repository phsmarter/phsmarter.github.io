                            11. essay my school learning 300 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>School is the place where we start our learning. Apart from learning to read, write, and excel in academics, the school also teaches us valuable life lessons that we can incorporate in our daily lives. It is the place where the foundation of our knowledge and morals are laid. So let’s look at some of the things that are worth remembering about our schools. School is the place where we learn to read and write. It is the most crucial place for a student, and it helps us to learn new things. The teachers are always helpful and teach us important things in life. We must always be regular to school as missing classes can lead to problems during exams. Schools teach us how to be consistent, punctual, and obedient. It also makes us better human beings so that we can treat our elders with respect. Most of what we learn is a result of the learning imparted by our teachers. It is said that schools shape us to become more responsible adults. We must treat our schools with respect as they are the places of worship for a student. A good student is the product of a good school. My school has excellent teachers who help students with studies, sports, and other extracurricular activities. They are the building blocks of aa school and teach us important lessons that we must apply in our daily lives.</p><p></p><p>Schools teach us to cooperate with our friends and classmates. The basic value of sharing is taught right from the beginning. We have different classrooms where the teachers teach us different subjects. Equal weightage is given to both studies and co-curricular activities so that we develop into better individuals. Our schools will always try to focus on our overall growth and transform us into healthy adults. The foundations of our learning are laid by our schools. School is the place that instills in us a sense of responsibility and hardworking spirit. We become better versions of ourselves through the rigorous tests that we are put through at schools. Each exam, each activity, and each lesson is aimed towards making us learn and grow. Right from the beginning, we are taught to be morally responsible for all our actions.</p><p></p><p>The various subjects introduce us to the world’s diversity and allow us to explore our surroundings with a unique perspective. We never know what problems await us when we grow up; schools are the training grounds that prepare us to face the unknown. We can overcome any hardship with the right motivation, and schools do that for us. We are not only taught to be responsible citizens but also hardworking individuals who strive hard to face the challenges that life throws at us. </p><p></p><p>All great men have been taught to read and write at their schools. It is our school that endows us with the right values at an early age. We teach a set of strong moral values that serve us later in our lives. School life is the period that makes up most of your childhood memories. We learn to laugh, cry, share, and support by co-habiting with our classmates. Schools are the framework that builds our moral characters and serves as a pathway that we must follow to achieve our dreams.</p><p></p><p>The initial years pass like a breeze and are the best years of our school life but, the advanced grades teach us that life is not always easy. We fail in tests, we stay awake at nights to finish assignments, we get scolded by teachers, but most importantly, we learn how to cope up with the hardships that life throws at us. Schools have a tremendous responsibility in shaping the minds of millions of young minds that are as soft as wet mud. The teachers are excellent potters who mold us so that the resultant figure is ready to bear the weight of life without cracking. Even if the later stages of school life feel like a burden, we must remember that our school’s happiest times have been spent.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Starting this semester, I was extremely intimidated by college and was nervous that I would not be able to do as well in college as I did in high school. I figured that the work would be much more difficult and that the teachers would not be as involved as they were in high school, which was true; but after the first moth or so, I began to really apply myself to my classes and now I feel like I have definitely adjusted well to the college atmosphere. Even though the whole “first semester” experience was not always easy or pleasent, I am very proud of myself to getting through it as well as I did and I am determined to improve next semester. My “frist semester experience” was a huge wake-up call for me. It made me realize that I can no longer rely on my teachers or my mother or my friends anymore and that it was time for me to be independent and handle things on my own. These past couple of months have included some of the most stressful experiences of my life, but they have made me mature and grow up much quicker than I ever imagined I would have. Although this semester has been rough, I would not have wanted it…show more content…</p><p>As of recently, I’ve been putting all of my deadlines and important dates regarding my classes into my calender so that I can organize my time better. I’ve also been trying to set more time aside for studying instead of just trying to always cram information the night before. Studying has always been especially diffuclt for me because I get distracted so easily, but now I am trying to create study sheets and I use index cards to keep myself more focused when studying. </p><br />

                        <p>Once you have well-defined constructs that you would like to measure, your question items should elicit responses that are related to the construct. For example, you may want to assess your clients' motivation to participate in certain program activities. You would first generate a list of questionnaire items that measure attitudes and beliefs as well as behaviors commonly associated with high or low motivation. Avoid "double-barreled" questions like, "My clients are dedicated and punctual."</p><p></p><p>Taking some time at the beginning of the period to outline your essay is a must. According to Livingston, "In order to write a successful essay, you must organize your thoughts." It may seem obvious, and that's because it is. If you don't make an outline for your essay, you'll likely start strong before going off topic or losing focus on the prompt. Either on paper or in your head, outline your stance on the prompt and several points you want to touch on.</p><p> </p>Teachers are those who make child knowledgeable and cultured. A teacher is a beautiful gift given by god because god is a creator of the whole world and a teacher is a creator of a whole nation.

Only a teacher knows what kind of association his student lives in and what kind of association he holds.<br /><br />Hard Work to be a Teacher<br /><br />It takes a lot of hard work to be a good teacher. First of all, always respect the elders and also obey them. Concentration should be increased toward the society and education. To be a teacher good one have a sense of unity in the heart, do not discriminate against anyone, everyone should be seen with a glance. They always encourage students, they never criticize their students. Develops a good interpersonal relationship with a student. One should always tell good things to their younger ones and always treat the classmate well, always take inspiration from the teacher.<br /><br />The teacher has a huge contribution to our life.

It only depends on the way they teach, which is different for everyone and this creates a different image in the student’s mind.

On this day a special ceremony takes place in the school, in which students participate enthusiastically. Nation always honours all those teachers who help in eradicating ignorance of darkness. A teacher is an ocean of knowledge, we should keep acquiring knowledge on a subject as long as possible.<br />
