Without discipline, life becomes dysfunctional and useless because nothing happens according to plan. If we have to
implement our strategy correctly about completing any task, then we need to be in discipline first. Discipline makes things easy
and brings success in our lives.
Discipline gives us lots of wonderful opportunities, the right way to move forward, learning new things in life,
experiencing more within less time, etc. Whereas, a lack of discipline causes a lot of confusion and disorder. There is no peace
and progress in life due to indiscipline, instead, a lot of problems arise.
We need to follow rules, follow orders and behave in an orderly manner. We should give importance to discipline in our
daily life. Those people who are not disciplined in their life, they face many problems and they get frustrated in life.

                                            Read the passage from Animal Farm.
Mr. Pilkington, of Foxwood, had stood up, his mug in his hand. In a moment, he said, he would ask the present company to drink a toast. But before doing so, there were a few words that he felt it incumbent upon him to say.
It was a source of great satisfaction to him, he said—and, he was sure, to all others present—to feel that a long period of mistrust and misunderstanding had now come to an end. There had been a time—not that he, or any of the present company, had shared such sentiments—but there had been a time when the respected proprietors of Animal Farm had been regarded, he would not say with hostility, but perhaps with a certain measure of misgiving, by their human neighbours. Unfortunate incidents had occurred, mistaken ideas had been current. It had been felt that the existence of a farm owned and operated by pigs was somehow abnormal and was liable to have an unsettling effect in the neighbourhood. Too many farmers had assumed, without due enquiry, that on such a farm a spirit of licence and indiscipline would prevail. They had been nervous about the effects upon their own animals, or even upon their human employees. But all such doubts were now dispelled. Today he and his friends had visited Animal Farm and inspected every inch of it with their own eyes, and what did they find? Not only the most up-to-date methods, but a discipline and an orderliness which should be an example to all farmers everywhere. He believed that he was right in saying that the lower animals on Animal Farm did more work and received less food than any animals in the county. Indeed, he and his fellow-visitors today had observed many features which they intended to introduce on their own farms immediately.
How does Orwell's characterization of Mr. Pilkington support his purpose?
Orwell draws parallels between Mr. Pilkington and the other farmers in town to show how dictatorial practices can be spread.
Orwell uses Mr. Pilkington to represent a new understanding between humans and animals that is beneficial for both.
Orwell uses Mr. Pilkington's speech to represent a modern way of farming that includes having farms run by animals.
Orwell draws parallels between Mr. Pilkington and leaders of countries who overlooked Stalin's poor treatment of his people.</a>

                            4. Learning Task 3: Ask your parent/guardian to read the short text below. Listen attentively then answer the questions that follow
Without discipline, life becomes dysfunctional and useless because nothing happens according to plan. If we have to
implement our strategy correctly about completing any task, then we need to be in discipline first. Discipline makes things easy
and brings success in our lives.
Discipline gives us lots of wonderful opportunities, the right way to move forward, learning new things in life,
experiencing more within less time, etc. Whereas, a lack of discipline causes a lot of confusion and disorder. There is no peace
and progress in life due to indiscipline, instead, a lot of problems arise.
We need to follow rules, follow orders and behave in an orderly manner. We should give importance to discipline in our
daily life. Those people who are not disciplined in their life, they face many problems and they get frustrated in life.

                            13. Read the passage from Animal Farm.
Mr. Pilkington, of Foxwood, had stood up, his mug in his hand. In a moment, he said, he would ask the present company to drink a toast. But before doing so, there were a few words that he felt it incumbent upon him to say.
It was a source of great satisfaction to him, he said—and, he was sure, to all others present—to feel that a long period of mistrust and misunderstanding had now come to an end. There had been a time—not that he, or any of the present company, had shared such sentiments—but there had been a time when the respected proprietors of Animal Farm had been regarded, he would not say with hostility, but perhaps with a certain measure of misgiving, by their human neighbours. Unfortunate incidents had occurred, mistaken ideas had been current. It had been felt that the existence of a farm owned and operated by pigs was somehow abnormal and was liable to have an unsettling effect in the neighbourhood. Too many farmers had assumed, without due enquiry, that on such a farm a spirit of licence and indiscipline would prevail. They had been nervous about the effects upon their own animals, or even upon their human employees. But all such doubts were now dispelled. Today he and his friends had visited Animal Farm and inspected every inch of it with their own eyes, and what did they find? Not only the most up-to-date methods, but a discipline and an orderliness which should be an example to all farmers everywhere. He believed that he was right in saying that the lower animals on Animal Farm did more work and received less food than any animals in the county. Indeed, he and his fellow-visitors today had observed many features which they intended to introduce on their own farms immediately.
How does Orwell's characterization of Mr. Pilkington support his purpose?
Orwell draws parallels between Mr. Pilkington and the other farmers in town to show how dictatorial practices can be spread.
Orwell uses Mr. Pilkington to represent a new understanding between humans and animals that is beneficial for both.
Orwell uses Mr. Pilkington's speech to represent a modern way of farming that includes having farms run by animals.
Orwell draws parallels between Mr. Pilkington and leaders of countries who overlooked Stalin's poor treatment of his people.</h2><br />
