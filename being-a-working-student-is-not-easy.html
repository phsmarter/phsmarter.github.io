                    <p>Give your thought about this scenario: A teacher noticed a remarkable similarity among four programs turned in by different students. Apparently, three students in one classroom had copied a computer program from a student in another class, and then turned it in as their own work. The teacher and another faculty member had spent many hours investigating the situation and were able to conclusively prove the theft. The teacher told the students that he could not accept the programs, and gave the students an opportunity to make up the work within a limited time frame. Here is how the three students handled the situation : 1. Student A was embarrassed and apologized for violating the teacher&#039;s trust. He worked very hard during the time limit, sacrificing grades in other classes, but was able to turn in a better program than what was originally assigned for the copied program. 2. Student B said nothing, but did not have time to complete the program within the time limit due to pressures from other courses. He accepted the failing grade. He was having difficulty in the course anyway, so eventually dropped the class. 3. Student C did not apologize, but apparently found another program written by a student in a previous year for a different teacher, copied that program and turned it in as his own. The teachers were able to prove this second incident and called for a parent conference. Neither the parent nor the student apologize, but the parent blame the school, claiming that the teachers were at fault for having a system where students can take the &quot;easy way out&quot; by being able to copy work too easily.                                          Question :How should the teachers respond to the parental complaints of student C? if they fail the student, the student will likely be rejected from the Ivy League College and could lose scholarship opportunities. If they bow to the parent&#039;s pressure and allow a third try to make up the work, this student will have an affair advantage over student B? ​</p>

                                            Two students were taking organic chemistry at the university. Having done well in their work and labs, they were both going into the final exam with solid A's. So far so good. Trouble was, they were so confident that they decided to party the night before the big test. It was a great night; one thing led to another, and they ended up sleeping late the following morning. 
They missed the exam! Disasterville! Being inventive souls, though, they went to see the professor to explain that they had been visiting a sick-out-of-town friend the night before. On the way home, they had a flat tire. With no spare tire and no car jack, they were stranded. They could only manage to hitch a lift back to town midmorning, which is why they missed the test. They were really sorry to have missed the exam, they said (they were so looking forward to it!) but wondered whether they might be able to take it that afternoon. 
The professor thought about it for a moment and decided that this would be permissible since they hadn't had time to discuss the exam with any of the students who had already taken it. After a short break for lunch, the two students were ready for the test. The professor placed them in separate rooms, handed each of them an exam booklet, and told to begin. Page one, question one. A simple one for five points. This will be easy! Having answered the first question each of the students turned the page for question number two: Which tire? (95 points).</a>

                            1. Give your thought about this scenario: A teacher noticed a remarkable similarity among four programs turned in by different students. Apparently, three students in one classroom had copied a computer program from a student in another class, and then turned it in as their own work. The teacher and another faculty member had spent many hours investigating the situation and were able to conclusively prove the theft. The teacher told the students that he could not accept the programs, and gave the students an opportunity to make up the work within a limited time frame. Here is how the three students handled the situation : 1. Student A was embarrassed and apologized for violating the teacher's trust. He worked very hard during the time limit, sacrificing grades in other classes, but was able to turn in a better program than what was originally assigned for the copied program. 2. Student B said nothing, but did not have time to complete the program within the time limit due to pressures from other courses. He accepted the failing grade. He was having difficulty in the course anyway, so eventually dropped the class. 3. Student C did not apologize, but apparently found another program written by a student in a previous year for a different teacher, copied that program and turned it in as his own. The teachers were able to prove this second incident and called for a parent conference. Neither the parent nor the student apologize, but the parent blame the school, claiming that the teachers were at fault for having a system where students can take the "easy way out" by being able to copy work too easily.                                          Question :How should the teachers respond to the parental complaints of student C? if they fail the student, the student will likely be rejected from the Ivy League College and could lose scholarship opportunities. If they bow to the parent's pressure and allow a third try to make up the work, this student will have an affair advantage over student B? ​</h2><br />
                        <p>The student was being too arrogant, he didn't apply any effort to make a</p><p>program of his own even though he was given a second chance. It is not the school's fault that the student was able to copy another student's work. The parent might also be at fault for spoiling the child/student. I believe that the school should not tolerate such disgraceful behaviour from a student and should give him an appropriate punishment.</p><p></p><p>p.s. all of these are just my thoughts and opinions about the scenario. I might be considered too harsh by some people but this is my honest opinion. </p><br />

For example, you can look at the gender variable, where the grouping is generally only into two, namely male  and female which are coded 1 and 2.</p><p> The number only serves as a category label, without having a numeric value like a true number.  These numbers do not have the same properties as numbers in general, so that on variables with a nominal scale, mathematical operations such as subtraction, addition, multiplication, etc. cannot be applied.</p><p> 2. <strong>Ordinal scale</strong></p><p> The ordinal scale is one type of measurement scale where the number symbols of the measurement results are in the form of a sequence or level.  Appropriate statistical tests are mode, median, frequency distribution and non-parametric statistics such as rank order correlation.</p><p> 3. <strong>Interval Scale</strong></p><p> Is a type of measurement scale that has characteristics similar to the ordinal scale, which has a certain order.  Another characteristic inherent in the interval scale is the existence of a scale unit.  Appropriate statistical tests are all statistical tests except those that are based on ratios such as the coefficient of variation.</p><p> 4. <strong>Ratio scale</strong></p><p> Ratio scale is a type of measurement scale that produces data of the highest quality.  The difference between the ratio scale and the interval scale lies in the presence of a zero value (based value).  On a ratio scale, zero is absolute, unlike on an interval scale.  The data generated by the ratio scale is ratio data.  There are no restrictions on the appropriate statistical test tools.</p><p></p><p> Learn information regarding level of measurements at https://brainly.ph/question/14034954.</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            11. Two students were taking organic chemistry at the university. Having done well in their work and labs, they were both going into the final exam with solid A's. So far so good. Trouble was, they were so confident that they decided to party the night before the big test. It was a great night; one thing led to another, and they ended up sleeping late the following morning. 
They missed the exam! Disasterville! Being inventive souls, though, they went to see the professor to explain that they had been visiting a sick-out-of-town friend the night before. On the way home, they had a flat tire. With no spare tire and no car jack, they were stranded. They could only manage to hitch a lift back to town midmorning, which is why they missed the test. They were really sorry to have missed the exam, they said (they were so looking forward to it!) but wondered whether they might be able to take it that afternoon. 
The professor thought about it for a moment and decided that this would be permissible since they hadn't had time to discuss the exam with any of the students who had already taken it. After a short break for lunch, the two students were ready for the test. The professor placed them in separate rooms, handed each of them an exam booklet, and told to begin. Page one, question one. A simple one for five points. This will be easy! Having answered the first question each of the students turned the page for question number two: Which tire? (95 points).</h2><br />
