AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by
aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 
percent.
Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. “Overtaking on the left” 
appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it 
relates to aggressive driving. “Improper lane change,” ”running stop sign,” 
and “running red light” rank second through four in terms of their 
contribution to fatalities.

                                            AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property." Actions such as running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities. The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) and 100 percent improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for "following too closely" or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, "running red light", "improper passing", and "overtaking on the left” topped other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes. Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 percent. Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. "Overtaking on the left" appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it relates to aggressive driving. "Improper lane change," "running stop sign," and "running red light” rank second through four in terms of their contribution to fatalities.QUESTION:1. What is the purpose of the text?

                                            AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property." Actions such as running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities. The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) and 100 percent improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for "following too closely" or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, "running red light", "improper passing", and "overtaking on the left” topped other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes. Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 percent. Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. "Overtaking on the left" appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it relates to aggressive driving. "Improper lane change," "running stop sign," and "running red light” rank second through four in terms of their contribution to fatalities.QUESTION:1.

                        <p>Sound energy is a type of energy that travels in waves and is produced when an object vibrates. It can be created in many ways and can take on many different forms. Here are ten examples of sound energy:</p><p></p><p>Human voice - The vibration of vocal cords produces sound energy.</p><p>Music - Sound energy is produced by musical instruments such as guitars, pianos, and drums.</p><p>Traffic - The sound energy is produced by the vibrations of moving vehicles.</p><p>Thunder - The sound energy is created by the shockwaves produced during lightning strikes.</p><p>Animals - Many animals such as birds, dogs, and cats produce sound energy through their vocal cords.</p><p>Waterfalls - The sound energy is produced by the force of water falling from a height.</p><p>Wind - The sound energy is produced by the vibrations of air molecules.</p><p>Fireworks - The sound energy is produced by the explosion of fireworks.</p><p>Sirens - The sound energy is produced by the vibrations of a siren's speakers.</p><p>Whistles - The sound energy is produced by the vibration of air passing through a whistle's chamber.</p><p>Overall, sound energy is produced by vibrations in the surrounding environment. These vibrations can be caused by a variety of sources, such as the movement of air, water, or solid objects. Once these vibrations occur, they travel through the air in waves, creating the sound energy that we hear. The intensity and volume of sound energy depend on the strength and frequency of the vibrations that produce it.</p><p>Oh boy, I remember learning about this in my science class! Let me think...10 examples of sound energy are: a ringing telephone, a barking dog, a musical instrument like a guitar or piano, thunder, a siren, a car engine, a person speaking or singing, a bird chirping, a door slamming, and waves crashing against the shore. Sound energy is produced when an object vibrates and creates sound waves that travel through the air or another medium. For example, when you pluck a guitar string, the string vibrates and creates sound waves that travel through the air to your ears, allowing you to hear the sound of the guitar. The same is true for all the other examples of sound energy - something is vibrating and creating sound waves that we can hear.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by
aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 
percent.
Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. “Overtaking on the left” 
appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it 
relates to aggressive driving. “Improper lane change,” ”running stop sign,” 
and “running red light” rank second through four in terms of their 
contribution to fatalities.

                            13. AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property." Actions such as running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities. The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) and 100 percent improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for "following too closely" or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, "running red light", "improper passing", and "overtaking on the left” topped other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes. Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 percent. Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. "Overtaking on the left" appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it relates to aggressive driving. "Improper lane change," "running stop sign," and "running red light” rank second through four in terms of their contribution to fatalities.QUESTION:1. What is the purpose of the text?

It teaches critical thinking, close reading, clear writing, and logical analysis; it uses these to understand the language we use to describe the world, and our place within it.  Different areas of philosophy are distinguished by the questions they ask.  Do our senses accurately describe reality?  What makes wrong actions wrong?  How should we live?  These are philosophical questions, and philosophy teaches the ways in which we might begin to answer them.<p> <strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS PO </p><p>Pa brainliest po</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) An economic migrant is someone who emigrates from one region to another, including crossing international borders, seeking an improved standard of living, because the conditions or job opportunities in the migrant's own region are insufficient. The United Nations uses the term migrant worker.</p><p>2.) Before being forced to flee, refugees may experience imprisonment, torture, loss of property, malnutrition, physical assault, extreme fear, rape and loss of livelihood. The flight process can last days or years.</p><p>3.) The major disadvantages of nuclear power plant are as follows: Disposal and storage </p><p>of nuclear waste. Uranium decomposes into harmful sub atomic masses. Accidental leakage of radiation and large-scale accidents can be catastrophic.</p><p>The Department of Energy (DOE) of the Philippines considers nuclear energy as a long-term energy option. It included nuclear power in its strategy to strengthen the country's energy security through the diversification of energy sources, mostly low-carbon, as the Philippines moves toward the clean energy transition.</p><br />

                            23. AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property." Actions such as running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities. The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) and 100 percent improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for "following too closely" or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, "running red light", "improper passing", and "overtaking on the left” topped other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes. Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 percent. Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. "Overtaking on the left" appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it relates to aggressive driving. "Improper lane change," "running stop sign," and "running red light” rank second through four in terms of their contribution to fatalities.QUESTION:1.
