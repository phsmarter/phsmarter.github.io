Most of the victims need years of treatment and therapy to get over their psychological trauma caused by the bully. Bullying is the use of technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person. Online threats and mean, aggressive, or rude texts, tweets, posts, or messages all count. So does posting personal information, pictures, or videos designed to hurt or embarrass someone else. We know that bullying can lead to various problems such as: anxiety, depression, stress, anger and low self-esteem. It can also have a negative effect on school performance. Bullying behaviors are associated with violence and criminal behavior later in life.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

What occurred next and how did it end?</p><p>         When somebody betrayed Marcos and the people began to oppose him, martial law was imposed. During the Marcos regime, Aquino was the most fierce opponent and a traitor. During that period, if you are disciplined and obey the government's orders, you will never be hurt.</p><p>          However, certain people are continuously fighting and causing conflict, even though it is pointless for them to strive against Marcos' leadership. When Aquino has a huge crowd to oppose Marcoses, he declares martial law. It ended up in the hands of Aquino, who changed the course of history.</p><p>          In my speech, I want every student to understand that martial law is advantageous and that there is nothing wrong with obeying the rules and remaining loyal to the government. I am not biased towards Marcos; I am accurately presenting what I have found over the years.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
