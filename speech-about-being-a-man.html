                                            Can I have some help?
Paragragh 14: And Fanny fully shared the joy of her friend; joy is so contagious. Tomorrow Rudolf will arrive, and how nice it will then be for Flora! She will see the greatest joy that a loving heart can imagine, and will not be a bit jealous—no! She will rejoice in another’s joy, rejoice in the happiness of her best friend, who possesses as her very own, so to speak, the man in whose honor every one has spoken so well and made such pretty speeches. And tomorrow he will be here; and, to make his wife happy till he comes, he has notified the day of his arrival. Oh what a joy it will be even to look upon such happiness!
The two ladies with radiantly happy faces returned to the company, which diverted itself till midnight, when everyone retired to his own room. Squire John helped his guests to their repose with a musical accompaniment, the band proceeding from window to window and intoning beneath each one a sleep-compelling symphony. Finally, the last note died away, and everybody dozed off, and dreamed beautiful dreams. The hunters dreamed of foxes (there was to be a hunt the next day), the orators dreamed of assemblies, Mr. Málnay dreamed of parties, and Lady Szentirmay dreamed of her husband.
In paragraph 14, the reactions from Lady Fanny toward Lady Flora reveal about the perspective of loyalty and honor?
	A.	
the reactions reveal that being virtuous does not come by riches and wealth, but comes by having a geniune heart and a pure respect for each other's happiness.
	B.	
the reactions reveal that being a woman of power and wealth one must remove themselves from the apperance of happiness and privately display happiness.
	C.	
the reactions reveal that Lady Fanny is a busy body in other people's affairs of life.
	D.	
the reactions reveal that close friends share the same happiness while on is secretly missing joy.</a>

With good memory, we can recall experiences and information from our lives to help make sense of information in informational listening. 13.

                                            Directions: Read the Excerpt of Emma Watson's Speech on Gender Equality at the United Nations and produce an evaluative statement 1. I was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women six months ago. The more I spoke about feminism, the more I realized that fighting for women's rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain is that this has to stop. For the record, feminism is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of political, economic, and social equality of the sexes. How do you react to the first paragraph 2. When I was eight, I was called bossy because I wanted to direct a play we would put on our parents. When at 14. I started to be sexualized by certain media elements. At 15. my girlfriends started dropping out of sports teams because they didn't want to appear masculine. At 18. my male friends were unable to express their feelings. Do you have the same experience with the author in this paragraph? Either yes or no, share your own experience 3. I decided that I was a feminist. This seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word. Women are choosing not to identify as feminists. Apparently, (women's expression is) seen as strong, aggressive, isolating and anti-men, unattractive even... Men, I would like to give you this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too. Because to date. I've seen my father's role as a parent being valued less by society. I've seen young men who have a mental illness, unable to ask for help for fear it would make them less of a man. Suicide is the biggest killer of men in the UK between 20 to 49, eclipsing road accidents, cancer, and heart disease. I've seen men fragile and insecure from what constitutes male success. Men don't have the benefits of equality either. In paragraphs three and four, what statements show agreeable and convincible? Why?​</a>

                                            ACTIVITY 1 In Lesson 1, we already learned that our anthropocentric view of the environment has resulted in its degradation and destruction. Humans, being considered as a superior being exploited nature and have forgotten that they are just part of the natural surroundings just like other non-human entities like plants and animals. In Lesson 2, you shall learn about the concepts of environmentalism and sustainability. It is hoped that after completing this module, you will be able to realize that care for the environment contributes to health, well-being, and sustainable development and be able to demonstrate the virtues of prudence and frugality towards the environment. Quick Reflection In 1854 Chief Seattle gave a moving speech about the sacredness of the land and the need for cautious stewardship of it. Below is a famous line from his speech. Try to reflect and analyze the message that he wanted to convey and answer the questions that follow. “Man did not weave the web of life. He is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself.” 1. What is the message that Chief Seattle wanted to convey? 2. Do you agree that we are just merely a strand in the web?  3.

Having explored twenty miles further in this desert, I found that the river still kept its depth and breadth, but that it was much more thickly lined with trees.Some twelve miles above the barge, we went ashore to refresh ourselves and to cook our food. One of the Indians 1 took with me to examine the nature of the soil and to cross the bends of the river. The other Indian I left with John Robinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches, light, and with the order that they should discharge a gun for my retreat, at the first sight of any Indian.Within a quarter of an hour, I heard a loud cry and the yelling of Indians, but no warning shot. Supposing my companions were surprised, and that the Indian guides had betrayed us, I seized my guide and found his arm fast to my hand with a garter, with my pistol aimed, ready to take revenge upon him. He advised me to fly and seemed ignorant of what was happening.But as he went on, I was struck with an arrow on the right thigh, without however, being seriously harmed. When this happened, I caught sight of two Indians drawing their bows. I prevented them from shooting by firing my French pistol.By the time I had loaded again, three or four more Indians were making ready to shoot. The first had fallen down or fled. At my next discharge, they shot their arrows. I made barricade of my servant, who offered not to fight Twenty or thirty arrows were shot to me, but fell short. I had discharged my pistol three or four times before. Opechanconough, the king of Pamaunck, with two hundred men, surrounded me. Each drew his bow and then lay it on the ground without shooting,My servant explained that I was the captain. They demanded my arms. The rest they said were slain; only me they would spare. My guide implored me not to shoot. In mak ing for the boat, being in the midst of a low quagmire, and minding the Indians more than my steps, 1 stepped directly into the quagmire,as did my Indian also, in trying to draw me out.Thus surprised. I resolved to try their mercy. I cast my arms from me. Until I did this, none dared to approach me; but now they seized me, drew me out of the quagmire, and led me to the king. I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us. The king was well-guarded by twenty bowmen, five on the Blank and five in the rear, and in each flank in front of him a sword and a gun with the same behind him; then a bowman on either side of me. The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back. On each flank was a sergeant, one running constantly toward the front, the other toward the rear, at a regular pace in good order. After this performance had lasted for sometime the warriors rushed into a circle with a dance: and finally each man departed for his lodging. The captain conducted me to his lodging, and gave me for supper a quarter of venison and some ten pounds of bread. What I left was kept for me, and sent with me to my lodging.​ paki sagot po plsss ​​</a>

                                            Emma Watson's Speech on Gender Equality at the UN(an excerpt)"I was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women 6 months ago. The more I spoke about feminism, the more I realized that fighting for women’s rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain is that this has to stop. For the record, feminism by definition is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of political, economic, and social equality of the sexes.When I was 8, I was called bossy because I wanted to direct a play we would put on for our parents. When at 14, I started to be sexualized by certain elements of  the media. At 15, my girlfriends started dropping out of sports teams because they  didn’t want to appear masculine. At 18, my male friends were unable to express their feelings. I decided that I was a feminist. This seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word. Women are choosing not to identify as feminists. Apparently, [women’s expression is] seen as too strong, too aggressive, isolating, and anti-men, unattractive even…Men, I would like to give this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too. Because to date, I’ve seen my father’s role as a parent being valued less by society. I’ve seen young men suffering from mental illness, unable to ask for help for fear it would make them less of a man. In fact, in the UK, suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20 to 49, eclipsing road accidents, cancer, and heart disease. I’ve seen men fragile and insecure by what constitutes male success. Men don’t have the benefits of equality, either... If you believe in equality, you might be one of the inadvertent feminists I spoke of earlier and for this I applaud you. We must strive for a united world but the good news is we have a platform. It is called HeForShe. I invite you to step forward, to be seen and I ask yourself: if not me, who? If not now, when? Thank you."SHARING YOUR VIEWS. Based on the excerpt that you have read from activity 2, share your views on the following questions: 1. What part of the excerpt do you agree? Give reasons.2.

Reflect and respond to the followingstatements and questions: Once upon a time, there was a young girl who loved going to school. However, she lived in an area where some political leaders didn’t want her to go to school. They used to attack the schools and try to stop girls going to school. Question: What would you do if the people with political power in your area attacked your school and said you (whether you are a boy or a girl) weren’t allowed to go anymore? So, one day this young girl, who was only eleven years old at the time, started to make speeches and write blogs saying that girls should be allowed to go to school as well. Question: How do you think the people with political power, who wereagainst girls in school, might have reacted when she started doing this?However, the people in power, who didn’t want girls to go to school, wanted to frighten her to stop her telling people these things. They knew lots of people around the world were listening to what she was saying, so they made it clear that they would harm her if she kept saying these things. Question: If someone threatened you for saying your opinion, would you stop or would you carry on anyway? The young girl did not stop saying her opinions. So, one day, when she was fourteen years old, a man came onto the bus when she was on her way back from school and shot her. The bullet hit her head. Luckily, this young girl did not die.Question: If you had been harmed for saying your opinions and survived, would you stop after that? She was taken to another country and she survived. She went on to finish school and continues to tell the world that girls should be allowed to go to school. Question: What do you think of this girl? Do you think what she did made an impact? Why/ why not? This girl is Malala Yousafzai and this happened between 2008 and 2012. In 2014 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and is now a leading global advocate championing the equal right to education for all, especially for girls.➢ Is Malala Yousafzai is a role model for you? Why / why not? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Women can be as good at being leaders and role models as men. ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Do you think we need more role models like Malala in the world and our local community? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Could you be someone like Malala, passionate about something you believe in, in your local community?______________________________________________________________________________➢ As a student how can you become active contributors towards eradication of gender inequality, ______________________________________________​</a>

The other Indian I left with John Robinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches, light, and with the order that they should discharge a gun for my retreat, at the first sight of any Indian.Within a quarter of an hour, I heard a loud cry and the yelling of Indians, but no warning shot. Supposing my companions were surprised, and that the Indian guides had betrayed us, I seized my guide and found his arm fast to my hand with a garter, with my pistol aimed, ready to take revenge upon him. He advised me to fly and seemed ignorant of what was happening.But as he went on, I was struck with an arrow on the right thigh, without however, being seriously harmed. When this happened, I caught sight of two Indians drawing their bows. I prevented them from shooting by firing my French pistol.By the time I had loaded again, three or four more Indians were making ready to shoot. The first had fallen down or fled. At my next discharge, they shot their arrows. I made barricade of my servant, who offered not to fight Twenty or thirty arrows were shot to me, but fell short. I had discharged my pistol three or four times before. Opechanconough, the king of Pamaunck, with two hundred men, surrounded me. Each drew his bow and then lay it on the ground without shooting,My servant explained that I was the captain. They demanded my arms. The rest they said were slain; only me they would spare. My guide implored me not to shoot. In mak ing for the boat, being in the midst of a low quagmire, and minding the Indians more than my steps, 1 stepped directly into the quagmire,as did my Indian also, in trying to draw me out.Thus surprised. I resolved to try their mercy. I cast my arms from me. Until I did this, none dared to approach me; but now they seized me, drew me out of the quagmire, and led me to the king. I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us. The king was well-guarded by twenty bowmen, five on the Blank and five in the rear, and in each flank in front of him a sword and a gun with the same behind him; then a bowman on either side of me. The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back. On each flank was a sergeant, one running constantly toward the front, the other toward the rear, at a regular pace in good order. After this performance had lasted for sometime the warriors rushed into a circle with a dance: and finally each man departed for his lodging. The captain conducted me to his lodging, and gave me for supper a quarter of venison and some ten pounds of bread. What I left was kept for me, and sent with me to my lodging.​</a>

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

She will see the greatest joy that a loving heart can imagine, and will not be a bit jealous—no! She will rejoice in another’s joy, rejoice in the happiness of her best friend, who possesses as her very own, so to speak, the man in whose honor every one has spoken so well and made such pretty speeches. And tomorrow he will be here; and, to make his wife happy till he comes, he has notified the day of his arrival. Oh what a joy it will be even to look upon such happiness!
The two ladies with radiantly happy faces returned to the company, which diverted itself till midnight, when everyone retired to his own room. Squire John helped his guests to their repose with a musical accompaniment, the band proceeding from window to window and intoning beneath each one a sleep-compelling symphony. Finally, the last note died away, and everybody dozed off, and dreamed beautiful dreams. The hunters dreamed of foxes (there was to be a hunt the next day), the orators dreamed of assemblies, Mr. Málnay dreamed of parties, and Lady Szentirmay dreamed of her husband.

                            11. Directions: Read the Excerpt of Emma Watson's Speech on Gender Equality at the United Nations and produce an evaluative statement 1. I was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women six months ago. The more I spoke about feminism, the more I realized that fighting for women's rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain is that this has to stop. For the record, feminism is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of political, economic, and social equality of the sexes. How do you react to the first paragraph 2. When I was eight, I was called bossy because I wanted to direct a play we would put on our parents. When at 14. I started to be sexualized by certain media elements. At 15. my girlfriends started dropping out of sports teams because they didn't want to appear masculine. At 18. my male friends were unable to express their feelings. Do you have the same experience with the author in this paragraph? Either yes or no, share your own experience 3. I decided that I was a feminist. This seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word. Women are choosing not to identify as feminists. Apparently, (women's expression is) seen as strong, aggressive, isolating and anti-men, unattractive even... Men, I would like to give you this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too. Because to date. I've seen my father's role as a parent being valued less by society. I've seen young men who have a mental illness, unable to ask for help for fear it would make them less of a man. Suicide is the biggest killer of men in the UK between 20 to 49, eclipsing road accidents, cancer, and heart disease. I've seen men fragile and insecure from what constitutes male success. Men don't have the benefits of equality either. In paragraphs three and four, what statements show agreeable and convincible? Why?​</h2><br />

Are the eventsnarrated in the storyreal?​"Capture by Opechancanough" An excerptBy John SmithWith two Indians for my quides and two of our own company, I set out, leaving seven in the barge. Having explored twenty miles further in this desert, I found that the river still kept its depth and breadth, but that it was much more thickly lined with trees.Some twelve miles above the barge, we went ashore to refresh ourselves and to cook our food. One of the Indians 1 took with me to examine the nature of the soil and to cross the bends of the river. The other Indian I left with John Robinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches, light, and with the order that they should discharge a gun for my retreat, at the first sight of any Indian.Within a quarter of an hour, I heard a loud cry and the yelling of Indians, but no warning shot. Supposing my companions were surprised, and that the Indian guides had betrayed us, I seized my guide and found his arm fast to my hand with a garter, with my pistol aimed, ready to take revenge upon him. He advised me to fly and seemed ignorant of what was happening.But as he went on, I was struck with an arrow on the right thigh, without however, being seriously harmed. When this happened, I caught sight of two Indians drawing their bows. I prevented them from shooting by firing my French pistol.By the time I had loaded again, three or four more Indians were making ready to shoot. The first had fallen down or fled. At my next discharge, they shot their arrows. I made barricade of my servant, who offered not to fight Twenty or thirty arrows were shot to me, but fell short. I had discharged my pistol three or four times before. Opechanconough, the king of Pamaunck, with two hundred men, surrounded me. Each drew his bow and then lay it on the ground without shooting,My servant explained that I was the captain. They demanded my arms. The rest they said were slain; only me they would spare. My guide implored me not to shoot. In mak ing for the boat, being in the midst of a low quagmire, and minding the Indians more than my steps, 1 stepped directly into the quagmire,as did my Indian also, in trying to draw me out.Thus surprised. I resolved to try their mercy. I cast my arms from me. Until I did this, none dared to approach me; but now they seized me, drew me out of the quagmire, and led me to the king. I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us. The king was well-guarded by twenty bowmen, five on the Blank and five in the rear, and in each flank in front of him a sword and a gun with the same behind him; then a bowman on either side of me. The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back. On each flank was a sergeant, one running constantly toward the front, the other toward the rear, at a regular pace in good order. After this performance had lasted for sometime the warriors rushed into a circle with a dance: and finally each man departed for his lodging. The captain conducted me to his lodging, and gave me for supper a quarter of venison and some ten pounds of bread. What I left was kept for me, and sent with me to my lodging.​ paki sagot po plsss ​​</h2><br />

                            23. Emma Watson's Speech on Gender Equality at the UN(an excerpt)"I was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women 6 months ago. The more I spoke about feminism, the more I realized that fighting for women’s rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain is that this has to stop. For the record, feminism by definition is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of political, economic, and social equality of the sexes.When I was 8, I was called bossy because I wanted to direct a play we would put on for our parents. When at 14, I started to be sexualized by certain elements of  the media. At 15, my girlfriends started dropping out of sports teams because they  didn’t want to appear masculine. At 18, my male friends were unable to express their feelings. I decided that I was a feminist. This seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word. Women are choosing not to identify as feminists. Apparently, [women’s expression is] seen as too strong, too aggressive, isolating, and anti-men, unattractive even…Men, I would like to give this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too. Because to date, I’ve seen my father’s role as a parent being valued less by society. I’ve seen young men suffering from mental illness, unable to ask for help for fear it would make them less of a man. In fact, in the UK, suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20 to 49, eclipsing road accidents, cancer, and heart disease. I’ve seen men fragile and insecure by what constitutes male success. Men don’t have the benefits of equality, either... If you believe in equality, you might be one of the inadvertent feminists I spoke of earlier and for this I applaud you. We must strive for a united world but the good news is we have a platform. It is called HeForShe. I invite you to step forward, to be seen and I ask yourself: if not me, who? If not now, when?

                            24.  Activity 2. A Powerful Story “From Where I Stand” (A Gender Equality Project For the Global Goals)Directions: Read a story below. Reflect and respond to the followingstatements and questions: Once upon a time, there was a young girl who loved going to school. However, she lived in an area where some political leaders didn’t want her to go to school. They used to attack the schools and try to stop girls going to school. Question: What would you do if the people with political power in your area attacked your school and said you (whether you are a boy or a girl) weren’t allowed to go anymore? So, one day this young girl, who was only eleven years old at the time, started to make speeches and write blogs saying that girls should be allowed to go to school as well. Question: How do you think the people with political power, who wereagainst girls in school, might have reacted when she started doing this?However, the people in power, who didn’t want girls to go to school, wanted to frighten her to stop her telling people these things. They knew lots of people around the world were listening to what she was saying, so they made it clear that they would harm her if she kept saying these things. Question: If someone threatened you for saying your opinion, would you stop or would you carry on anyway? The young girl did not stop saying her opinions. So, one day, when she was fourteen years old, a man came onto the bus when she was on her way back from school and shot her. The bullet hit her head. Luckily, this young girl did not die.Question: If you had been harmed for saying your opinions and survived, would you stop after that? She was taken to another country and she survived. She went on to finish school and continues to tell the world that girls should be allowed to go to school. Question: What do you think of this girl? Do you think what she did made an impact? Why/ why not? This girl is Malala Yousafzai and this happened between 2008 and 2012. In 2014 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and is now a leading global advocate championing the equal right to education for all, especially for girls.➢ Is Malala Yousafzai is a role model for you? Why / why not? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Women can be as good at being leaders and role models as men. ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Do you think we need more role models like Malala in the world and our local community? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Could you be someone like Malala, passionate about something you believe in, in your local community?______________________________________________________________________________➢ As a student how can you become active contributors towards eradication of gender inequality, ______________________________________________​</h2><br />

The journal of Captain John Smith-a recordof the perils and frustrations of America's first settlers-is oneof the first literature of America."Capture by Opechancanough"              An excerpt           By John SmithWith two Indians for my quides and two of our own company, I set out, leaving seven in the barge.

I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us.

The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back. On each flank was a sergeant, one running constantly toward the front, the other toward the rear, at a regular pace in good order. After this performance had lasted for sometime the warriors rushed into a circle with a dance: and finally each man departed for his lodging. The captain conducted me to his lodging, and gave me for supper a quarter of venison and some ten pounds of bread. What I left was kept for me, and sent with me to my lodging.​</h2><br />

A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein. The eaa which is in the shortest supply is called the ‘limiting’ amino acid. In general, animal proteins tend to be high quality while vegetable proteins tend to be low quality. The exception is soy protein which is quite high quality. What is the strategy used in the development of the paragraph?Select one:a.Etymologyb.Connotationc.Comparisond.Intensive definitione.Contrastf.Extensive definitiong.DenotationCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 3Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Read the following excerpt from the short story, Dead Stars by Paz Marquez Benitez: Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east at the Yellow Sea, travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.
