                                            The Two Brothers
Leo Tolstoy
Two brothers set out on a joumey together. At noon they lay out on a forest to rest. When they woke up they say
a stone lying next to them. There was something written on the stone, and they tried to make out what it was.
"Whoever finds this stone, let him go straight to the forest at sunrise. In the forest, a river will appear, let him swim
across the river to the other side. There he will see a she-bear and her cubs. Let him take the cubs from her and run
up the mountain with them, without looking back. On the top of the mountain, he will see a house, and in that house
he will find happiness."
When they had read what was written on the stone, the younger brother said: "Let us go together. We can swim
across the river, carry off the bear cubs, take them to the house on the mountain, and together they find happiness."
1 am not going into the forest after bear cubs," said the elder brother, "and I advise you not to go. In the first
place, no one can know whether what is written on this stone is the truth -perhaps it was written in jest... In the
second place, even if what is written here is the truth-suppose we go into the forest and night comes, and we cannot
find the river. We shall be lost. And if we do find the river, how are we going to swim across it? In the third place, even
if we swim across the river, do you think it is an easy thing to take her cubs away from a she-bear? She will seize us,
and instead of finding happiness, we shall perish and all for nothing. And, most of all, the stone does not tell us what
kind of happiness we should find in that house. It may be that the happiness awalting us there is not at all the sort of
happiness we would want."
The younger brother replied, "In my opinion, you are wrong. What is written on the stone could not have been
put there without reason. And it is all perfectly clear. In the first place, no harm will come to us if we try. In the second
place, if we do not go, someone else will read the inscription on the stone and find happiness, and we shall have lost
it all. In the third place, if you do not make an effort and try hard, nothing in the world will succeed. In the fourth place,
I should not want it thought that I was afraid of anything."
And so, the younger brother followed all the instructions on the stone. When he reached the top of the mountain
the people came out to take him to the city, where they made him their king. He ruled for five years, but in the sixth
year, another king waged war against him. The city was conquered, and he was driven out.
Again, the younger brother became a wandered, and he arrived one day at the house of the elder brother. The
brother was living in a village and had grown neither rich nor poor. The two brothers rejoiced at seeing each other, and
at once began telling of all that happened to them.
"You see," said the elder brother, "I was right. Here I have lived quietly and well, whole you, though you may have
been a king, have seen a great deal of trouble."
1 do not regret having gone into the forest and up the mountain," replied the younger brother. "I may have nothing
now, but I shall always have 
something to remember, while you have no memories at all."

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3. One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3. One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower.

                            4. The Two Brothers
Leo Tolstoy
Two brothers set out on a joumey together. At noon they lay out on a forest to rest. When they woke up they say
a stone lying next to them. There was something written on the stone, and they tried to make out what it was.
"Whoever finds this stone, let him go straight to the forest at sunrise. In the forest, a river will appear, let him swim
across the river to the other side. There he will see a she-bear and her cubs. Let him take the cubs from her and run
up the mountain with them, without looking back. On the top of the mountain, he will see a house, and in that house
he will find happiness."
When they had read what was written on the stone, the younger brother said: "Let us go together. We can swim
across the river, carry off the bear cubs, take them to the house on the mountain, and together they find happiness."
1 am not going into the forest after bear cubs," said the elder brother, "and I advise you not to go. In the first
place, no one can know whether what is written on this stone is the truth -perhaps it was written in jest... In the
second place, even if what is written here is the truth-suppose we go into the forest and night comes, and we cannot
find the river. We shall be lost. And if we do find the river, how are we going to swim across it? In the third place, even
if we swim across the river, do you think it is an easy thing to take her cubs away from a she-bear? She will seize us,
and instead of finding happiness, we shall perish and all for nothing. And, most of all, the stone does not tell us what
kind of happiness we should find in that house. It may be that the happiness awalting us there is not at all the sort of
happiness we would want."
The younger brother replied, "In my opinion, you are wrong. What is written on the stone could not have been
put there without reason. And it is all perfectly clear. In the first place, no harm will come to us if we try. In the second
place, if we do not go, someone else will read the inscription on the stone and find happiness, and we shall have lost
it all. In the third place, if you do not make an effort and try hard, nothing in the world will succeed. In the fourth place,
I should not want it thought that I was afraid of anything."
And so, the younger brother followed all the instructions on the stone. When he reached the top of the mountain
the people came out to take him to the city, where they made him their king. He ruled for five years, but in the sixth
year, another king waged war against him. The city was conquered, and he was driven out.
Again, the younger brother became a wandered, and he arrived one day at the house of the elder brother. The
brother was living in a village and had grown neither rich nor poor. The two brothers rejoiced at seeing each other, and
at once began telling of all that happened to them.
"You see," said the elder brother, "I was right. Here I have lived quietly and well, whole you, though you may have
been a king, have seen a great deal of trouble."
1 do not regret having gone into the forest and up the mountain," replied the younger brother. "I may have nothing
now, but I shall always have 
something to remember, while you have no memories at all."

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3. One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3. One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.
