Write youranswer on a separate paper.1.Marxism is a social, political,and economic philosophy named after Karl Marx.2.Marxism posits the struggle between social classes, specifically between the bourgeoisie or capitalists,and the proletariat ,or workers.3.Marxist thought has continued to have an important influence on critical thought,all the more so recently after the rise of globalization studies .4.Karl Marx is surely the most influential contemporary Marxist thinker in the United States.5.Louis Althusser provided a two-stage argument for the labor theory of value.6.Marx claims that no previous theorist has been able adequately to explain how capitalism as a whole can make a profit.7.Capitalism is distinctive.Jameson argues that it involves not merely the exchange of commodities,but the advancement of capital in the form of money.8.Althusser's own solution relies on the idea of explanation of the worker.9.The cost of the commodity is determined in the same way as the cost of every other such as terms of the amount of socially necessary labor power required to produce it.10.Profit is the result of the labour performed by the worker beyond what is necessary to create the value of his/her wages.11.Even if the labor theory of value is considered discredited, there is no element of this theory that remain of worth.12.Jameson's refused to accept that capitalism involves a Harmony of interests between worker and capitalist.​13. Marx's denied that there is any long-run tendency to equilibrium in the market, and his descriptions of mechanisms which underlie the trade-cycle of boom and bust.14.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Global political economy is a field of study that deals with the interaction between political and economic forces. At its centre have always been questions of human welfare and how these might be related to state behaviour and corporate interests in different parts of the world. Despite this, major approaches in the field have often focused more on the international system perspective. A side effect of this has been the relative neglect of non-elites and an all-too-often missing recognition of ordinary individuals. While states remain central to international politics, they have gradually intensified their relations with multinational corporations and strengthened their engagement with international organisations. Naturally, these changes in the world around us have led to a certain rethinking of the way we understand and position individuals as actors in the global economy. To account for this, many scholars now prefer to use the term ‘global political economy’ GPE over the more traditional term ‘international political economy’ (IPE).

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The pandemic can affect the globalization adversely. Even before the covid pandemic the developed countries had already started moving towards protectionist measures to save local jobs and this Pandemic has just accelerated that process. Globalization would lose its essence for coming few years at least, because globalization primarily means people moving across borders and having knowledge and cultural exchange but due to pandemic even the movement within countries is restricted for citizens, forget international travel. However, Internet has brought the world closer and globalization will exist in areas of technology exchange/cooperation.</p><br />

                            7. Directions: Write T if the statement is true and write F if it is not. Write youranswer on a separate paper.1.Marxism is a social, political,and economic philosophy named after Karl Marx.2.Marxism posits the struggle between social classes, specifically between the bourgeoisie or capitalists,and the proletariat ,or workers.3.Marxist thought has continued to have an important influence on critical thought,all the more so recently after the rise of globalization studies .4.Karl Marx is surely the most influential contemporary Marxist thinker in the United States.5.Louis Althusser provided a two-stage argument for the labor theory of value.6.Marx claims that no previous theorist has been able adequately to explain how capitalism as a whole can make a profit.7.Capitalism is distinctive.Jameson argues that it involves not merely the exchange of commodities,but the advancement of capital in the form of money.8.Althusser's own solution relies on the idea of explanation of the worker.9.The cost of the commodity is determined in the same way as the cost of every other such as terms of the amount of socially necessary labor power required to produce it.10.Profit is the result of the labour performed by the worker beyond what is necessary to create the value of his/her wages.11.Even if the labor theory of value is considered discredited, there is no element of this theory that remain of worth.12.Jameson's refused to accept that capitalism involves a Harmony of interests between worker and capitalist.​13. Marx's denied that there is any long-run tendency to equilibrium in the market, and his descriptions of mechanisms which underlie the trade-cycle of boom and bust.14. The Canbridge economist Joan Robinson, in An Essay on Marxian Economics, picked out two aspects of particular note.15. Other commodities simply pass their value on to the finished commodities, but do not create any extra value.​</h2><br />

</p>1.	What is the editorial’s main point?  <p>The central point of the editorial is to question whether United Kingdom should be accounted for causing the rising of cases and deaths due to COVID19. Although they are among the countries who have launched the vaccination drive, the new variant has originated from their country.  </p><p>
</p>2.	Is there evidence to back up the main point? Give three examples.  Among these evidences are;
<p>a.	UK’s premature lifting of COVID19 protocols
</p><p>b.	UK failed the rising cases and number of deaths immediately
</p><p>c.	They reopened without thinking that not all Britons are vaccinated and thus exposing them even further.  </p><p>
</p>3.	How would you describe the editorial board’s argument?  <p>The editorial board’s argument are counterintuitive yet informative. However, it is obviously not siding the UK government and that is Boris Johnson.  </p>4.	Comment on the language and words used in the reading material.  <p>The language and choice words are not that hard to understand. Although there are technical terms, the context clues were a large help to get the whole picture of a sentence.  </p><p>
</p>5.	Were you persuaded to believe the claims by the material’s ideas? Why or why not?  <p>Yes, because a lot facts and evidences were presented. Other than that, it sounded persuasive. </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/21873944</p><br />
