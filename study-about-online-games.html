                                            Exercise vs. Video Games Do you exercise regularly? Recently, a lot of video games and other online entertainment activities have been popping in the internet. This led to a decline of physical activity among children, making it easy to get used to the habit of not exercising. Exercise has many benefits. For instance, studies show that it boosts academic performance. In addition to that, it has been proven that children who exercise more develop healthy habits later in life. In conclusion, having plenty of exercise at your young age is a brilliant idea. Exercise needs to be established as a routine for children like you. This can be achieved if you include exercise in your daily activities. My topic is... who is article about ? why is it important for people to know about this?​</a>
