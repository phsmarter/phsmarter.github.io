When it comes to pets, dogs are certainly the best choice. They are loyal,affectionate and active companions. No other choice of pet can compete with a dog.Firstly, dogs are incredibly loyal companions. They see themselves as part of thefamily. Secondly, dogs are extremely affectionate animals. No other animal can showtheir love when you arrive home at the end of the day quite like a dog can. Thirdly,dogs are very active. You can always keep fit taking your dog for walk and playinggames together.2. How would you feel if there were plastic bottles, disposed chemicals, ripped fishingnets and other discarded containers scattered all around your house? Sadly, for a vastmajority of marine life around the world, these conditions have become a commonplace, our oceans are suffering terribly. It is therefore vital that humans stop thedestruction of our precious oceans with these careless and irresponsible acts ofpollution.3. Long, long time ago, Arrojo, a young and mighty giant, fell in love with an ordinarymortal girl named Aloya. When this girl died, giant Arojo cried so bitterly that his tearsthen turned into mounds of earth. These eventually became hills as lasting proof of hisgrief, now known as, the Chocolate Hills.4.Looking like giant mole hills, the Chocolate Hills are probably Bohol's most famoustourist attraction. Most people who first see the landscape in pictures can hardlybelieve that these hills are natural artifact or not man-made. If this idea is true, then theeffort of building them surely surpasses the construction of the pyramids in Egypt. Theyare covered with grass, which at the end of the dry season, turns into chocolate brown.It is from this color that the name Chocolate Hills was derived.5. If you wish to go to Chocolate Hills on your own, you can do this. From Tagbilaran,you will have to go to the integrated bus station in Dao and catch a bus going toCarmen. Ask the driver to drop you off at the Chocolate Hills complex which is about 4kilometers before the town of Carmen. From there, have a 10-minute walk along a roadwinding up to the complex.​</a>

One sunny day, my little puppy jumped onto our red couch and played with his new toy. I liked to watch him play and it made me feel happy? Soon my playful puppy yawned. He was a tired puppy. I picked him up and laid him on his soft, round bed. Soon, my sleepy puppy was snoring away. _______________________________________ Chilled strawberry ice cream is an amazing treat. It is very creamy and has a very smooth texture. Pineapple slices make it colorful. Strawberries add bright and red color too. It also makes an ice cream taste wonderful. White soft cream is added to make the dessert look beautiful. The ice cream is served with crispy biscuit to make it tastes more delicious. _______________________________________ Seashells belong to mollusca or mollusks. There are more than 100,000 kinds of mollusks living in the sea for about 500 million years now. There are many classifications of mollusks. Two of these are being single-shelled and two-shelled. Single-shelled mollusks crawl using their muscle that acts as their foot. Their shells are usually spiraling. Two-shelled mollusks have two valves joining by hinges. These open and close the valves of the shell. _______________________________________ The warm weather allows me to play outside. I play under the sprinkler with my younger brother. We run through the cold water and scream each time! At night, I play hide and seek with my good friends. I usually hide in a big bush; I love it when the weather is warm! _______________________________________ Dogs are domesticated animals that have been living with humans with generations. Dogs can be classified in several different ways. They can be classified by breed. Examples include beagles, basset hounds, poodles and countless others are defined by the American Kennel Club (AKC). They can also be classified by their role in the lives of their masters and the work they do. For example, a dog might be a family pet, a working dog, a show dog, or a hunting dog. In many cases, dogs are defined both by their breed and their roll. For example, a dog could be a beagle that is a family pet. ​</a>

Long, long time ago, Arrojo, a young and mighty giant, fell in love with an ordinarymortal girl named Aloya. When this girl died, giant Arojo cried so bitterly that his tearsthen turned into mounds of earth. These eventually became hills as lasting proof of hisgrief, now known as, the Chocolate Hills.4.Looking like giant mole hills, the Chocolate Hills are probably Bohol's most famoustourist attraction. Most people who first see the landscape in pictures can hardlybelieve that these hills are natural artifact or not man-made. If this idea is true, then theeffort of building them surely surpasses the construction of the pyramids in Egypt. Theyare covered with grass, which at the end of the dry season, turns into chocolate brown.It is from this color that the name Chocolate Hills was derived.5. If you wish to go to Chocolate Hills on your own, you can do this. From Tagbilaran,you will have to go to the integrated bus station in Dao and catch a bus going toCarmen. Ask the driver to drop you off at the Chocolate Hills complex which is about 4kilometers before the town of Carmen.
