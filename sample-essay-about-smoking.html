                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>smoking is bad for your body it may cause pollution/air pollution  to people with sickness  and definitely childrens , they might not breath because of the smoke on cigarettes </p><p></p><br />
                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="essay-about-smoking-in-restaurant%e2%80%8b">
                            2. essay about smoking in restaurant​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>As more and more people are aware of the importance of health, many people in Hong Kong have suggested banning smoking in all eateries. They think that this proposal will bring about benefits on public health. However, some businessmen disagree with it as they think that it carries certain drawbacks on our economy. This has become a controversial issue.</p><p>First of all, eateries should be suitable place for families to go to. For example, many families with young children will go to McDonald’s. No one wants to see young children playing with cigarette butts or breathing in cigarette smoke. It is undeniable that if people want to relax by lighting up a cigarette while enjoying their cup of coffee at their favourite cafes, they would be told that they can no longer have this pleasure as smoking is now illegal in all eateries, it will be very disturbing and annoying. However, those smokers can smoke at their home or other places themselves without affecting the others. It is not a must for the smokers to smoke in eateries so as to relax.</p><p></p><p>It is true to say that some businesses have many customers who smoke. Places such as restaurants and bars let people smoke while they are having a meal. The club-goers could usually light up a cigarette to go with their drinks. They will feel unhappy if they are told to put out their cigarettes as it is illegal to smoke in all eateries. Those customers would definitely spend less on their drinks and the bar owner would eventually end up the biggest loser. Many eateries will suffer and even lose their businesses. And in turn, this will harm the whole economy. However, they are not the only customers. Most of the people in Hong Kong care about their health. Eateries can still make profit from these non-smokers. Banning smoking in all eateries will not affect the businesses of the eateries seriously.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knows that smoking affects people’s health. Cigarette smoke can cause lung cancer and respiratory problems. Undoubtedly, we cannot ban one from smoking if they, themselves, do not care about their own health. However, as most of the eateries are air-conditioned, when someone smokes, the smoke will spread through the whole eateries via the ventilation system. Second-hand smokers will also have a great chance of getting cancer. This means that anybody who breathes in cigarette smoke is placing his or her lives at risk. Smokers are not only placing their lives at risk but also other customers’. There is no reason why other customers have to breathe in the cigarette smoke. Health risks of the public can be a very serious consequence of smoking.</p><p></p><p>To conclude, there is no doubt that the ban may affect the level of income for a few businesses. However, the majority of customers of eateries are non-smokers. If smoking is banned in all eateries, it will help to improve people’s health. Health is the most important thing for people. If you are healthy enough, you can do anything you want to do. Although we have to consider the economic stability when faced with the present economic recession, the economy will recover one day if our citizen are healthy and hard work enough.</p><p> </p><p>Credits to Chui Ho Man for this wonderful essay</p><br />

Special interest and big tobacco profited off the loss of lives, leading to many to take legal action against tobacco manufacturers. On the heels of the historic Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), we are now facing a new smoking trend: e-cigarettes. Right now, California’s Proposition 56, a ballot measure to tax e-cigarettes, is up for a vote, and the same special interest that supported big tobacco has set their sights killing the measure. If passed, the measure tax e-cigarettes just like other tobacco products.The special interests and big tobacco have argued that e-cigarettes aren 't like regular cigarettes. Our research disputes that notion. In fact, the toxins acetaldehyde and formaldehyde are emitted through the electronic nicotine delivery systemthe component that delivers flavored vapor and nicotine to the user. Although it’s still unclear as to how much nicotine the user is getting, studies have shown that the effect on the lungs is the same.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Smoking in Public Spaces</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>argumentative essay about smoking is allowed in public spaces</p><p></p><p>Smoking is a highly controversial topic, and whether it should be allowed in public spaces is a question that has been debated for many years. While some argue that smoking is a personal choice and should be allowed in public spaces, others believe that it should be banned due to its negative impact on public health. In this essay, I will argue that smoking should not be allowed in public spaces.</p><p></p><p>The first reason why smoking should be banned in public spaces is because of the negative impact it has on public health. Smoking is a major cause of lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious health problems. Secondhand smoke, which is the smoke that non-smokers inhale from smokers, can also cause serious health problems, especially for children and people with respiratory problems. Therefore, allowing smoking in public spaces puts everyone at risk, not just smokers.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why smoking should be banned in public spaces is that it can be a nuisance to others. Smoking produces a strong odor that can be unpleasant for non-smokers, and it can also cause discomfort and irritation to those with allergies or asthma. Additionally, cigarette smoke can stain clothes, furniture, and walls, leading to a loss of property value.</p><p></p><p>Finally, allowing smoking in public spaces can send the wrong message to young people. By allowing smoking in public spaces, we are normalizing a behavior that is harmful to one's health. This can lead young people to believe that smoking is a socially acceptable behavior, and increase the likelihood that they will start smoking themselves.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, smoking should not be allowed in public spaces due to its negative impact on public health, the nuisance it can cause to others, and the message it sends to young people. It is important to protect the health and well-being of everyone in our communities, and banning smoking in public spaces is one way to achieve this goal.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            15. write persuave essay about students should not smoke in school?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Smoking is a common habit among many people, including students. However, smoking in school should not be allowed. Not only is it harmful to the individual smoker, but it can also negatively impact their peers and the environment. For these reasons, schools should implement strict rules against smoking in their premises.</p><p></p><p>To begin with, smoking is a health hazard. It has been scientifically proven that smoking causes fatal diseases such as lung cancer, heart diseases, and chronic bronchitis. These diseases can be both painful and expensive to treat, making smoking a dangerous and costly habit. More so, the presence of smokers in the school environment exposes other students and staff to second-hand smoke, which is equally harmful. By allowing smoking in school, the administration could be contributing to an unhealthy environment where student health is compromised.</p><p></p><p>In addition to health hazards, smoking in school can also be a distraction to learning. Smoking requires a significant amount of time and preparation, from finding a smoking spot to lighting up the cigarette. This time could be spent on studies or other constructive activities that contribute to academic success, rather than destructive habits. Moreover, the smell of cigarette smoke can be overpowering and distracting to others, making it hard for them to concentrate on their studies. This can ultimately lead to poor academic performance and undermine the values of a learning institution.</p><strong>Pa </strong><strong>brainliests </strong><strong>po </strong><strong>thank </strong><strong>you </strong><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Smoking has been a major health issue for decades, with its effects reaching far beyond just the smoker themselves. Unfortunately, despite the numerous campaigns and laws, there are still many people who smoke. Even more disheartening is the fact that some students smoke, even while in school. In this essay, I will argue that students should not smoke in school, and I will provide several reasons to support my claim.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, smoking is harmful to one's health. It is a well-known fact that smoking is one of the leading causes of lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses. Secondhand smoke is also extremely dangerous, and it can lead to health problems for those who are exposed to it, especially for children and teenagers. Therefore, if students smoke in school, they are not only putting themselves at risk but also endangering the health of their classmates.</p><p></p><p>Second, smoking in school is a violation of school policies. Schools have rules and regulations that are put in place to protect the welfare of their students. Smoking is typically prohibited in schools, and those who are caught smoking can face disciplinary action, such as suspension or expulsion. Students who smoke in school are disregarding the rules and the authority of the school. This disobedience can lead to negative consequences, both academically and personally.</p><p></p><p>Third, smoking in school can negatively affect a student's academic performance. Smoking can lead to a decrease in cognitive abilities, which can negatively impact a student's learning and memory retention. Furthermore, students who smoke may have difficulty concentrating and may experience fatigue, making it difficult to focus in class. This can lead to poor grades and a lack of academic progress.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, smoking in school is a bad influence on younger students. Students who smoke are often viewed as "cool" or "rebellious" by younger students. This can lead to younger students experimenting with smoking themselves, which can lead to a lifetime addiction and the associated health risks. Therefore, it is crucial that students set a positive example for their younger peers by abstaining from smoking.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, smoking in school is harmful, violates school policies, negatively impacts academic performance, and sets a bad example for younger students. Therefore, students should not smoke in school. It is imperative that schools enforce their policies on smoking and provide students with the necessary education and resources to quit smoking. By working together, we can ensure a healthier and safer environment for all students in school.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Smoking should be banned.</p><p>There are medications out there that are harming everyone. The chemical I'm going to discuss is nicotine, which is contained in cigarettes. Although some good people believe that smoking cigarettes will have no direct impact on their lives, they are mistaken; smoking is nothing more than a death sentence.</p><p>Smoking is not a joke; despite what we see on TV, in comic books, and maybe right in front of our eyes, it has a negative impact on our health. Have you ever looked at the bottom of the cigarette box closely? If you didn't see, it says: SMOKING MAY CAUSE LUNG CANCER, HEART DISEASE, AND MAY ALSO COMPLICATE PREGNANCY. Doesn't it surprise you that cigarette firms are warning us?</p><p>Lung cancer, lip, mouth, and tongue cancer, as well as heart attacks, are all caused by smoking. Smoking can devastate all of your goals and dreams. Have you ever seen a cigarette commercial? You have to agree, the people in that commercial appear to be having a good time. Have you ever noticed how they never show you an "after picture"? The reason for this is that such people are now unsightly as a result of too many puffs on their bodies. "Every puff is like a taste of death," observed General George Washington. Even if you only take a small puff, you can become really unwell. As a result, you should never begin smoking.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Smoking and drinking wine are two habits that have both positive and negative effects on the human body. While wine is considered a healthy beverage in moderation, smoking is widely known to be harmful to health.</p><p></p><p>Smoking is a dangerous habit that can cause a wide range of health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems. The chemicals in cigarettes can damage the lungs, heart, and blood vessels, leading to serious health issues. Smoking can also increase the risk of stroke, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. In addition, second-hand smoke can be harmful to non-smokers, including children and pets.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, drinking wine in moderation has been associated with some health benefits. Red wine, in particular, contains antioxidants called polyphenols that can help protect the heart and blood vessels from damage. Moderate wine consumption has also been linked to a reduced risk of stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer. However, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to liver damage, high blood pressure, and other health problems.</p><p></p><p>It's important to note that while moderate wine consumption may have some health benefits, it is not recommended for everyone. Pregnant women, individuals with certain health conditions, and those taking certain medications should avoid alcohol altogether. Similarly, smoking is not recommended for anyone due to its harmful effects on health.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while drinking wine in moderation may have some health benefits, it's important to be aware of the risks involved with excessive alcohol consumption. Smoking, on the other hand, is widely known to be harmful to health and should be avoided altogether. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle that includes regular exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding harmful habits like smoking can help promote overall health and wellbeing.</p><br />

                            22. Write an essay about "Smoke Free Community."​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A smoke-free community is a society where smoking is prohibited in all public places, including parks, beaches, and other outdoor areas. This means that individuals are not allowed to smoke in any public space, and smoking is only allowed in designated smoking areas. This initiative is aimed at promoting public health by reducing the exposure of non-smokers to secondhand smoke and encouraging smokers to quit.</p><p></p><p>One of the main benefits of a smoke-free community is the reduction of health risks associated with smoking. Secondhand smoke has been linked to various health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory infections. By prohibiting smoking in public spaces, individuals are protected from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, which can have a significant impact on their health and well-being.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a smoke-free community can also help to reduce the number of smokers. When smoking is banned in public places, it becomes less socially acceptable, and smokers are more likely to quit or reduce their smoking. This can lead to a decrease in the number of smokers in the community, which can have a positive impact on public health.</p><p></p><p>Another benefit of a smoke-free community is the improvement of the environment. Cigarette butts and other smoking-related litter can be harmful to the environment, and smoking bans can help to reduce this problem. By prohibiting smoking in public spaces, individuals are encouraged to dispose of their cigarette butts properly, which can help to keep the environment clean and healthy.</p><p></p><p>However, some people may argue that a smoke-free community infringes on individual rights and freedoms. They may argue that individuals should have the right to smoke in public spaces if they choose to do so. However, it is important to remember that smoking is not just a personal choice, but it also affects the health and well-being of others. Therefore, a smoke-free community is a reasonable restriction on individual rights that can have a significant impact on public health.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, a smoke-free community is an initiative aimed at promoting public health by reducing the exposure of non-smokers to secondhand smoke and encouraging smokers to quit. It has numerous benefits, including the reduction of health risks associated with smoking, the decrease in the number of smokers, and the improvement of the environment. While some may argue that it infringes on individual rights and freedoms, it is a reasonable restriction that can have a significant impact on public health.</p>In recent years, there has been a growing push towards creating smoke-free communities. The idea behind this movement is to create safer and healthier environments for everyone, by reducing exposure to secondhand smoke and promoting healthier lifestyle choices. This essay will explore the benefits of creating smoke-free communities, and the steps that can be taken to achieve this goal.<br /><br />Firstly, it is important to recognize the negative health effects of smoking, both for smokers themselves, and for those around them. Smoking is a leading cause of lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious health conditions. Additionally, secondhand smoke can be just as harmful as smoking itself, causing respiratory problems and other health issues in non-smokers who are exposed to it. By creating smoke-free communities, we can reduce these health risks, and promote healthier lifestyles for everyone.<br /><br />Another benefit of smoke-free communities is that they create a more pleasant and enjoyable environment for everyone. Non-smokers are often bothered by the smell and smoke of cigarettes, and may be reluctant to spend time in areas where smoking is allowed. By creating smoke-free environments, we can make public spaces more welcoming and accessible to everyone, regardless of their smoking habits.<br /><br />So, what steps can be taken to create smoke-free communities? One approach is to implement smoking bans in public spaces, such as parks, beaches, and other outdoor areas. This can be done through legislation or community action, and can help protect non-smokers from secondhand smoke, while also encouraging smokers to quit or cut back on their habits. Additionally, smoke-free housing initiatives can help promote healthier living environments, by creating smoke-free policies for apartments, condos, and other shared living spaces.<br /><br />Finally, education and awareness campaigns can play a critical role in creating smoke-free communities. By educating people about the dangers of smoking, and promoting healthier lifestyles, we can encourage more people to quit smoking, and create a culture of health and wellness in our communities. This can be done through public health initiatives, school programs, and other community outreach efforts.<br /><br />In conclusion, creating smoke-free communities is an important goal for our society. By reducing exposure to secondhand smoke, promoting healthier lifestyles, and creating more pleasant public spaces, we can improve the health and well-being of everyone in our communities. With the right strategies and community support, we can create a smoke-free future for<br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Smoking is a dangerous and unhealthy habit that has numerous negative effects on a person's health. It is the leading cause of preventable deaths in the world, and has been linked to a wide range of serious health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition to the health risks, smoking is also a major contributor to air pollution, and the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke can have negative effects on the environment as well.</p><p></p><p>One of the main arguments against smoking is that it is incredibly addictive. The nicotine in cigarettes is a highly addictive substance, and it can be very difficult for people to quit once they have started smoking. This addiction can have serious consequences, as it can lead to long-term health problems and a decreased quality of life.</p><p></p><p>Another argument against smoking is that it is expensive. The cost of cigarettes, along with the additional medical expenses that can result from smoking-related health problems, can add up quickly. In addition, smoking can also have financial consequences for non-smokers, as they may be forced to pay higher health insurance premiums due to the increased health risks associated with secondhand smoke.</p><p></p><p>Finally, smoking is also harmful to those around the smoker. Secondhand smoke is just as dangerous as firsthand smoke, and can cause serious health problems for anyone who is exposed to it. This is particularly concerning for children, who are more vulnerable to the effects of secondhand smoke.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, smoking is a dangerous and unhealthy habit that has numerous negative effects on both the individual and those around them. It is highly addictive, costly, and harmful to both personal and public health. Therefore, it is important for individuals to quit smoking and for society to take steps to reduce the prevalence of smoking.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One of the most common problems we are facing in today’s world which is killing people is smoking.

                            24. sample sample of essay about a good and a successful manager​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: One day,the manager came to work and made the people do their work,and he made sales go up,prices decrease on certain items,the work place with more employees inside,and better advancements for the buisness.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>(I'm still doing homework,so it's a bit short,you might have to add more)</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A manager is a person who is in charge of tasks such as strategizing the work to be done by employees. The duties of a manager involve: organizing, directing, controlling and planning on behalf of the group. A manager has a group of staff who usually report to him/her. A good manager has to be accustomed to the duties that he/she assigns to workers. For managers to be effective leaders, they must have followers who emulate their virtuous character traits, have a goal, commitment, and will and skills to achieve the goals (Redden 2000).</p><p></p><p>A good manager motivates the employees. Employees need to be motivated in order to retain them even on tough days in the company such as when the company is experiencing financial losses, etc. The manager should respect the team values in return for employees to give their best of their abilities in their assigned tasks (Blake &amp; Mouton 1998). It is necessary for the manager to encourage employees to be outspoken and speak of their experiences at work place. In response, the manager should take action based on what the employees tell them (Fiedler 2007).</p><p></p><p>Good managers should ensure that each employee knows his/her duties. Possessing solid goals empowers the employees and keeps them focused on their work (Blake &amp; Mouton 1998). The manager has the duty to explain the goals of the company extensively, when the deadline is due and what the manager will do with the results. In this way, the employees know beforehand that they also have a responsibility to accomplish the task at a given time (Halsey &amp; Blanchard 1997). Also, a good manager should present goal oriented feedback that relates to their work to help them improve on their abilities.</p><p></p><p>The job of a manager entails planning and advising employees on the work that they should do. Thus, a good manager understands the need of delegating tasks appropriately. The manager can start accomplishing his duties by giving basic tasks. As the employees improve on their work, the adept managers have the ability to identify an employee’s weakness and strengths (Redden 1999). Gradually, the supervisors can give workers more complex duties that involve more responsibilities. However, it is essential for managers to assign duties that he/she performs accurately in order to correct the employees when they make mistakes. As the workers start to take more responsibility, the manager should give them duties that will expand their skills and enable them to take ownership of their work (Covey 2001). In this way, the manager will be able to discern how many workers he/she can handle, and it will also make them more valuable to the company.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>❤️</p><br />

                            25. informative essay about addressing the hazards of secondhand smoke</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The use of tobacco products of any kind can have harmful and potentially life-changing effects on the body. Whether chewing tobacco, snuffed tobacco, or smoking tobacco, all contain chemicals that damage the user’s health. However, there is one drastically significant difference between smoking and smokeless tobacco- smoking tobacco affects others around them while smokeless only affects the user. Is it fair that nonusers face the carelessness of another’s secondhand smoke? Is it fair to be walking down the sidewalk and be blasted with a stranger’s cloud of smoke? Is it fair to be subjected to secondhand smoke while being in a car with smoking passengers? The answer to all of these questions is that no, it is simply not fair. The dangerous</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>This is not the case. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, “There is no safe exposure to secondhand smoke. When you are around a person who is smoking, you inhale the same dangerous chemicals as the smoker. Breathing even a little secondhand smoke can be dangerous.” It can be so dangerous that approximately 3,000 adults die each year from lung cancer due to secondhand smoke, and another 46,000 die from heart disease also acquired from secondhand smoke. The people that are most negatively impacted and largely account for the numbers above are people that live with smokers. The chances have increased in recent years from 20% to 30% as far as developing life-threatening cancer or disease. The American Lung Association recently released a whopping number of 2.5 million deaths from exposures to secondhand smoke in the years between 1964 to 2014. That is 2.5 million preventable deaths. The sad thing is, it’s the selfishness and carelessness of others that allowed for such a thing to happen. The worst group of affected individuals are the children. Secondhand smoke is responsible for up 300,000 lower respiratory infections in infants up to 18 months of age, and nearly 8000 calls for hospitalization each year. Annually, 430 SIDS deaths occur on top of that. Children of any age are susceptible to inner ear infections and asthma flare-ups as well. More than 24 million, or about 37 percent of children in the U.S. have been exposed to secondhand smoke (American Lung</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation</strong></p><p><strong>hope it helps</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>‘Cigarette smoking’ is not a new term for people in the entire world. Most of the people know that it is not good for health but still the smokers continue to smoke, why? People start smoking cigarettes with very numerous individual reasons. Most of the youngsters start smoking cigarettes because they think it looks cool and stylish. Some start smoking because their friends or family members smoke. Cigarette smoking is one of the worst things that people can do to their bodies. It is one of the most leading preventable causes of death in the world. Globally, tobacco use is the second cause of death after hypertension which is currently responsible for killing one in ten adults (WHO, 2010). Smoking cigarette is one of the biggest public health threats the world is facing today. This essay is a research which contains the basic information about the dangers of cigarette smoking. This will be an attempt to analyse the determinants of cigarette smoking. This essay will try to illustrate the factors which are associated with the cigarette smoking cessation in various groups like teenagers, pregnant women and passive smokers. The research will be mainly focused on the policies, interventions and strategies of government and health organisations towards cessation of smoking tobacco on the global, national as well as local level. It will also try to analyse the inequalities in health due to smoking.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Cigarette smoking is a major public health concern that affects millions of people around the world. Cigarette smoking has been linked to various health risks such as lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, and COPD, among other illnesses. Despite the clear risks associated with smoking, people continue to smoke cigarettes, making it one of the top preventable causes of death in the United States.</p><p></p><p>The dangers of smoking are well-documented and widely known. Smoking is responsible for around 30 percent of all cancer deaths, and smoking-related illnesses are responsible for an additional 20 percent of all deaths in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cigarette smoking is also responsible for around 30 percent of all heart disease deaths, and smoking-related illnesses are responsible for an additional 20 percent of all deaths from heart disease in the United States.</p><p></p><p>Cigarette smoking is also linked to a number of other health issues, such as respiratory illnesses, infertility, and even depression. There is also evidence that smoking can lead to an increased risk of developing certain types of cancers. Additionally, smoking can cause a range of psychological issues, such as depression, anxiety, and stress.</p><p></p><p>The effects of smoking on the environment are also significant. Cigarette smoke contains more than 7,000 different chemicals, many of which are toxic and known to cause cancer. In addition, the smoke produced by cigarettes can contribute to air pollution, which is linked to respiratory problems, heart disease, and other health issues.</p><p></p><p>Despite the clear risks associated with smoking, people continue to smoke cigarettes. While many efforts have been made to reduce the number of smokers, such as increased taxes on cigarettes and bans on smoking in public places, the number of smokers continues to rise. This is due in part to the widespread availability of cigarettes, as well as the influence of advertising and marketing campaigns by tobacco companies.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, cigarette smoking is a major public health concern that affects millions of people around the world. Smoking is linked to a range of health issues, from cancer to depression, as well as environmental issues such as air pollution. Despite the risks associated with smoking, people continue to smoke cigarettes, making it one of the top preventable causes of death in the United States.</p><br />
