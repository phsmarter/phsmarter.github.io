It is such a critical issue that world leaders have met to try and find a workable solution. Unfortunately, no agreement was reached I because everyone had a different point of view. Some people think that nothing we do can change I what is happening, that it is completely natural. On the other hand, others argue strongly that the human impact on the climate over the last hundred years, and the increasing levels of carbon dioxide I into the atmosphere, have had a devastating impact on our environment. Who is right?First, it is important to understand that our climate has always been changing Even today climate change is one of the possible explanations for the extinction of the dinosaurs, millions of years I ago. Likewise, the end of the ice age in prehistoric times was also due to the warming of Earth's l climate. Both of these significant events occurred well before any human Intervention. Others in the scientific community believe that the movement and reactions in the Sun influence our own climate more than we previously realized Solar flares leap out from the Sun and send great bursts of heat I and radiation towards the Earth, causing some changes to our atmosphere. Volcanic eruptions too. I other pollutantsover which ople have absolutely no control, also send huge amounts of gas and also cause changes in regional climates, Human beings areinto the atmosphere. These events I certainly not the only ones who impact upon our environment.​</a>

                            5. Claim about argumentative essay about polar bear that affected by the climate change ​</h2><br />
                        <p>Climate change is an undeniable threat that is affecting several aspects of our planet, including polar bears. These magnificent creatures are facing dire consequences due to the changing climate. The Arctic is warming at an alarming rate, and this is causing a massive loss of sea ice, which is the polar bears' natural habitat. As a result, the polar bear population is declining at an alarming rate, and the species is currently facing the risk of extinction.</p><p></p><p>The loss of sea ice is one of the most significant threats to polar bears. Polar bears rely on the sea ice for hunting, breeding, and traveling across the Arctic. The bears use the sea ice as a platform to hunt for seals, which are their primary source of food. The melting of sea ice makes it difficult for the bears to access their prey, which leads to starvation, malnutrition, and in some cases, cannibalism. This results in a decrease in the polar bear population.</p><p></p><p>Climate change has also affected the polar bear's breeding cycle. The female polar bear relies on the sea ice for breeding, and they give birth to their young on the ice. However, with the ice melting at a rapid rate, the female polar bears are forced to come on land to give birth. This puts them at a higher risk of being attacked by predators or human activities, which can lead to their death or that of their offspring.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the increase in temperatures caused by climate change has resulted in the loss of permafrost in the Arctic region. This is affecting the polar bear's habitat, as their dens are constructed in the permafrost. Without the permafrost, the dens collapse, and the polar bears are left without a place to shelter.</p><p></p><p>It is essential to take action to mitigate the impact of climate change on polar bears. The first step is to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. This can be achieved through the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Additionally, we can reduce our carbon footprint by driving less, using public transport, and eating a plant-based diet.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, climate change is having a devastating impact on the polar bear population, and urgent action is needed to prevent their extinction. The loss of sea ice, the disruption of their breeding cycle, and the loss of permafrost are just a few of the threats that polar bears face due to climate change. It is crucial that we take immediate steps to reduce our carbon footprint and minimize the impact of climate change on our planet's ecosystems.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Gender equality is a topic that has gained widespread attention in recent years. While progress has been made in some areas, there is still a long way to go to achieve true gender equality. The fight for gender equality is not just a women's issue, but it's a societal issue that affects us all. In this argumentative essay, I will explore the importance of gender equality, the challenges that remain, and why we should continue to fight for this fundamental human right.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>The fight for gender equality is crucial for many reasons. Firstly, it promotes fairness and equal opportunities for all individuals regardless of their gender. It enables everyone to have access to the same resources, opportunities, and benefits, irrespective of gender. Secondly, gender equality is critical for economic growth and development. Studies have shown that companies and countries that promote gender equality have higher levels of productivity and economic growth. Finally, gender equality is essential for building a just and peaceful society. When everyone has equal opportunities, discrimination and violence decrease, and people can live together in harmony.</p><p></p><p>Despite progress being made in gender equality, challenges remain. Women still face barriers to education, employment, and leadership positions. The gender pay gap also continues to persist, with women earning less than men in many industries. Additionally, gender-based violence remains prevalent worldwide. These challenges highlight the need for continued advocacy and action to address gender inequality.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, gender equality is a fundamental human right that should be enjoyed by everyone. Promoting gender equality leads to a fairer, more prosperous, and peaceful society. While progress has been made, there is still a long way to go. It is imperative that we continue to fight for gender equality and work towards creating a world where everyone has equal opportunities regardless of their gender.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po ^^</p><br />

Also according to the article, after Svante Arrhenius died in 1927, his theory was forgotten for a long time because it was thought that human activities on the Earth were too minimal to actually have any effect on the Earth. However, the statement has been proven that global warming has become a major issue due to the constant pollution produced from man made machines. Global warming starts when many air pollutants and carbon monoxide are trapped in the Earth’s atmosphere causing the planet to become very hot. According to Nasa this picture depicts the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere over time. As you can see it wasn’t until recently that the level of CO2 emission has skyrocketed to a never before seen level. This can potentially be very dangerous</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Climate change is an issue that has become one of the most pressing concerns of the modern era. The rise in global temperatures and weather-related disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires have made it clear that we cannot continue with the status quo. Despite a vast majority of scientists agreeing that human activity is the primary cause of climate change, there are still skeptics and deniers who refuse to acknowledge the severe consequences of unchecked environmental degradation. It is time to take action and address climate change before it's too late.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>The evidence linking climate change to human activity is overwhelming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is made up of hundreds of climate scientists from around the world, has repeatedly warned about the devastating effects of greenhouse gas emissions. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, which powers our transportation and industries, is the key contributor to climate change. In addition to rising temperatures, we are also seeing the melting of polar ice caps, which raises sea levels and causes flooding, loss of biodiversity, more severe weather events, and droughts that can lead to famine.</p><p></p><p>Some politicians and corporations continue to deny climate change or resist action to mitigate its effects, claiming that environmental regulations will hamper economic growth. However, in reality, investing in renewable energy and transitioning away from fossil fuels can create countless jobs and boost local economies. In addition, doing nothing about climate change can have dire economic consequences due to the impacts of environmental disasters and the rising costs of healthcare associated with air pollution and heatwaves. The effects of climate change will not only impact this generation but also the generations to come, which is why it's essential to take immediate action.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, climate change is an urgent issue that requires immediate action to mitigate its effects, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and invest in renewable energy. The risks of doing nothing are far too great, and the time to act is now. The world must come together, put aside political differences, and work towards a sustainable future. While individual action can make a difference, it will take government policies and corporate leadership to make the significant changes necessary to address climate change.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Climate change can be traced down to since the mid-1800s, when the industrial revolution first started taking place all around the world. Lives of human and animal species have been negatively affected since then, with events such as natural disasters, the melting of ice in polar regions, and change in weather and living conditions. Climate change in polar regions, in particular, has faced the most damage compared to any other region because of its location in regard to the sun. Climate change holds many different views and opinions about the effects, and even the existence itself, but evidence is clear and unmistakable in global ramifications and local impact in polar regions</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#CarryOnLearning^v^</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Teenage pregnancy is a major social issue that has been prevalent for many years. It is a critical problem that affects not only the teenage mothers but also their families, partners, and society as a whole. The consequences of teenage pregnancy can be devastating, including health risks for both the mother and the baby, social stigma, and economic challenges. Therefore, it is essential to address this issue and raise awareness about the importance of preventing teenage pregnancy.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>Teenage pregnancy can have significant negative impacts on the physical, emotional, and social well-being of the mother and the baby. Teenage mothers are at a higher risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth, such as premature birth, low birth weight, and maternal mortality. Moreover, teenage mothers may experience social stigma, discrimination, and isolation, which can lead to mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Furthermore, teenage pregnancy can have long-term economic consequences, as teenage mothers are less likely to complete their education and secure stable employment.</p><p></p><p>Preventing teenage pregnancy requires a comprehensive approach that involves education, access to healthcare, and support for young people. It is essential to provide accurate and comprehensive sex education that includes information about contraception, safe sex practices, and the consequences of teenage pregnancy. Additionally, young people should have access to affordable and confidential healthcare services, including contraception, prenatal care, and counseling. Moreover, parents, teachers, and community leaders should provide support and guidance to young people, promoting healthy relationships and responsible decision-making.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>Teenage pregnancy is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to address. Preventing teenage pregnancy is not only crucial for the health and well-being of teenage mothers and their babies but also for the social and economic development of society. By providing education, healthcare, and support to young people, we can empower them to make responsible choices and prevent unintended pregnancies. It is time to take action and work together to create a world where teenage pregnancy is no longer a prevalent social problem.</p><p></p><p>Hope it helps! #KeepOnLearning</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Topic: Gender Equality</p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Gender equality is a fundamental human right that is still elusive to many individuals and societies across the globe. It is an issue that affects people from all walks of life, and its negative impact can be seen in all spheres of society, including politics, education, health care, and the workplace. In this context, it is essential to recognize the importance of gender equality and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>Gender equality is not just a women's issue but an issue that affects everyone. Despite efforts towards progress, gender inequality is still pervasive in many societies, leading to a lack of equal opportunities, unequal pay, and gender-based violence. For example, in many workplaces, women are still paid less than their male counterparts for the same work. This is unacceptable and perpetuates the cycle of gender inequality. Therefore, it is crucial to address these issues by implementing policies that promote gender equality, such as equal pay and equal access to education and healthcare.</p><p></p><p>Another issue related to gender equality is gender-based violence. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by gender-based violence, including sexual assault, domestic violence, and harassment. This violence is often fueled by patriarchal attitudes and a lack of respect for women's rights. It is therefore imperative to create awareness and education programs that address gender-based violence and work towards changing societal attitudes towards women.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, gender equality is a fundamental human right that should be respected and upheld by all individuals and societies. It is a complex issue that requires the efforts of policymakers, civil society, and individuals to create a more equitable and inclusive society. By working towards gender equality, we can ensure that everyone has equal opportunities and can live their lives without fear of discrimination or violence. It is time for all of us to step up and make gender equality a reality</p><br />

                            22. MAKE YOUR OWN ARGUMENTATIVE CONTENT about gender equality/Climate change/discrimination/teenage pregnancy/bullying -Paragraph Form-at least 100 words-3 Paragraph•introduction•body•conclusion ​​</h2><br />
                        <p>Gender equality is the state of having equal rights and opportunities regardless of one's sex or gender identity. It is a fundamental human right and a necessary condition for social justice and economic development. However, gender inequality still persists in many areas of life, such as education, health, work, politics, and culture. This essay will argue that gender equality is beneficial for everyone and that we should take action to achieve it.</p><p></p><p>The first reason why gender equality is important is that it promotes human dignity and respect. When people are discriminated against or oppressed because of their gender, they are denied their full potential and their human worth. This can lead to low self-esteem, mental health problems, violence, and human rights violations. On the other hand, when people are treated equally and fairly, they can develop their talents and abilities, contribute to society, and live with dignity and freedom.</p><p></p><p>The second reason why gender equality is beneficial is that it fosters social and economic progress. When women and men have equal access to education, health care, employment, and decision-making, they can contribute more effectively to the development of their families, communities, and countries. According to the United Nations, gender equality can reduce poverty, improve health outcomes, enhance productivity, increase innovation, and strengthen democracy. Moreover, gender equality can also help address some of the global challenges we face today, such as climate change, conflict, and migration.</p><p></p><p>The third reason why gender equality is necessary is that it is a matter of justice and human rights. Gender equality is not only a goal in itself, but also a means to achieve other goals. As the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights". Therefore, we have a moral obligation to ensure that everyone enjoys the same rights and opportunities regardless of their gender. This requires challenging the stereotypes, norms, and structures that perpetuate gender inequality and discrimination.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, gender equality is a vital issue that affects everyone in society. It is not only a women's issue or a men's issue, but a human issue. Gender equality can enhance human dignity and respect, foster social and economic progress, and uphold justice and human rights. Therefore, we should all work together to achieve gender equality in all aspects of life.</p><br />

Despite the progress made over the years, gender-based discrimination and inequality continue to exist in various forms, such as unequal pay, limited access to education, and job opportunities. This issue has been a subject of debate in many parts of the world, with some countries making significant strides towards gender equality, while others lag behind. It is crucial to address this issue to ensure a fair and just society for all.</p><p></p>Body:<p>Gender-based discrimination affects both men and women, but women are the most affected. They face various forms of discrimination, such as gender-based violence, unequal pay, and limited access to education and job opportunities. These inequalities have a ripple effect on society, leading to poverty, social exclusion, and low levels of economic growth. Achieving gender equality requires a multi-pronged approach, including legal and policy frameworks, education, and cultural and social change.</p><p></p><p>Policies and legal frameworks should ensure that women have equal access to education and job opportunities. Gender mainstreaming should also be incorporated into all government policies to ensure that gender-based issues are addressed. Education is also crucial in addressing gender inequality. Educating girls and boys on gender issues can help them understand the importance of gender equality and promote a culture of respect and equality.</p><p></p>Conclusion:<p>Gender inequality is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to address it. We all have a role to play in promoting gender equality, whether it is through advocating for policy and legal reforms or promoting cultural and social change. Achieving gender equality is not only a human rights issue, but it is also essential for the sustainable development of society. We must all work together to promote gender equality and ensure a just and equal world for all.</p><br />

                        <p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>In today's world, societal problems such as gender inequality, climate change, discrimination, teenage pregnancy, and bullying are becoming increasingly common. These issues have a detrimental impact on individuals, communities, and the planet, leading to negative consequences that can last a lifetime. It is up to all of us to work together to create a more positive, inclusive, and sustainable future.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>Gender equality is a crucial issue that affects people of all ages, genders, and backgrounds. Despite progress in recent years, women still face significant barriers to equality, including unequal pay, limited access to education and healthcare, and discrimination in the workplace. It is essential that we work towards creating a more equitable society where everyone has the same opportunities and rights, regardless of their gender.</p><p></p><p>Climate change is another pressing issue that requires immediate action. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, are causing irreversible damage to the planet, leading to rising temperatures, sea levels, and extreme weather events. To combat climate change, we must reduce our carbon footprint, invest in renewable energy, and take steps to protect our natural resources.</p><p></p><p>Discrimination, teenage pregnancy, and bullying are also significant societal issues that must be addressed. Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation can have a profound impact on individuals and communities, leading to feelings of isolation, discrimination, and even violence. Teenage pregnancy can also have negative implications, including limited opportunities for education, employment, and financial stability. Bullying, whether in person or online, can have lasting effects on an individual's mental health and well-being.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, gender equality, climate change, discrimination, teenage pregnancy, and bullying are all critical issues that require our attention and action. By working together, we can create a more equitable, sustainable, and inclusive society that values and respects all individuals. It is up to each of us to do our part, whether that means reducing our carbon footprint, speaking out against discrimination, or supporting policies that promote equality and justice for all.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The topic I chose to write about is Global Warming. Global Warming has been studied and analyzed for many years. Many people are poorly educated on this matter and do not truly understand what is actually going on. Not everyone believes that global warming truly exist. A lot of people believed that global warming was completely man-made. And, even though this is not completely incorrect, there is an abundance of evidence to prove that global warming is problem that persists, right now as we speak. Global warming has continued to impacted us in many ways. From the tornadoes of 2011 to hurricane Sandy in 2012, the effects of global warming are all around us and we as humans have to propose a plan to sop it.The first picture is from the famous …show more content…</p><p></p><p>According to Lenntech, Svante Arrhenius and Thomas Chamberlin realized that humans could increase the heat of the earth by adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere(Enzler). Also according to the article, after Svante Arrhenius died in 1927, his theory was forgotten for a long time because it was thought that human activities on the Earth were too minimal to actually have any effect on the Earth. However, the statement has been proven that global warming has become a major issue due to the constant pollution produced from man made machines. Global warming starts when many air pollutants and carbon monoxide are trapped in the Earth’s atmosphere causing the planet to become very hot. According to Nasa this picture depicts the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere over time. As you can see it wasn’t until recently that the level of CO2 emission has skyrocketed to a never before seen level. This can potentially be very dangerous</p><br />
