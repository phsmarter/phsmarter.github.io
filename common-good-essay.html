Air pollution may be due to a lot of factors, the most common of which are exhaust gases from vehicles, factory gas emissions, and natural events. Exhaust gases from vehicles have continuously dominated the air especially in highly urbanized towns and cities mainly because the government lacks control and citizens prefer convenience to the harmful effects. Likewise, the government has not exercised good control over the location of factories that emit gas elsewhere. More often than not, air pollution is caused by natural events such as forest fires, volcanic eruptions, wind erosion, and pollen dispersal.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Today is Wednesday tomorrow is Thursday haha</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Points lang po talaga habol ko haha</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Four Principles: Personhood, Common Good, Solidarity, Subsidiarity
</p><p>
</p><p>With these four principles we can grasp human society in its entirety and consider this reality truthfully. They are interrelated and we, as human beings, must act in accordance with them. No human can reasonably situate himself outside of social life. We have responsibility through the Commandment of love of God and neighbour to help others, to serve the common good, to help every individual live a dignified life, and to protect the intrinsic rights of groups and associations.
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Personhood
</p><p>
</p><p>This is covered in the previous section, under The Dignity of the Human Person.
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Common Good
</p><p>
</p><p>Vatican II defined the Common Good as “the sum total of social conditions which allows people, either as groups or as individuals, to reach their fulfilment more fully and more easily.” It is about the progress of persons.
</p><p>
</p><p>A society that wishes and intends to remain at the service of the human being at every level is a society that has the common good – the good of all people and of the whole person as its primary goal.
</p><p>
</p><p>We must be interested in the good of all, even of people nobody thinks about because they have no voice and no power. The goods of the earth are there for everyone. The common good consists not only of the material or external good of all human beings; it also includes the comprehensive good of the human being, including even the spiritual good.
</p><p>
</p><p>The common good of society is not an end in itself. It is only part of a bigger picture, the ultimate end of which is God. The common good, as a mere materialistic socio-economic ideal, would count for little without any transcendental goal.
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>The Common Good and Politics
</p><p>
</p><p>The Catechism of the Catholic Church clearly states that “it is the role of the state to defend and promote the common good of civil society, its citizens, and intermediate bodies.”
</p><p>
</p><p>The common good, in fact, is the very reason that political authority exists.
</p><p>
</p><p>It is the role of political institutions to make available to persons the necessary material, cultural, moral and spiritual goods required to allow each individual to achieve their full development. Among the duties of government is the need to harmonise different sectoral interests with the requirements of justice. It is an extremely delicate task but one of great importance.
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>The Universal Destination of Goods
</p><p>
</p><p>God created the world for all and the goods of the world should in principle, be at the disposal of all and for the good of all, without preferential treatment. John Paul II in the encyclical letter Centesimus Annus states: “the earth, by reason of its fruitfulness and its capacity to satisfy human needs, is God’s first gift for the sustenance of human life.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Every person has the right to what is vitally necessary and this must not be withheld from him. The Church accepts that there is a right to property and that there will always be differences in how much people own, but if some have more while others lack the bare necessities there is a need for charity and also for justice.
</p><p>
</p><p>Is private property permissible? It is reasonable for there to be private property; through work and the acquiring of private property a person shapes the earth and makes a piece of it his own. Private property encourages freedom and independence and it also encourages the individual to preserve and care for his property. The Second Vatican Council, in Gaudium et spes, states that private property and other forms of private ownership of goods “assure a person a highly necessary sphere for the exercise of his personal and family autonomy and ought to be considered as an extension of human freedom….stimulating exercise of responsibility, it constitutes one of the conditions for civil liberty.”
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>Preferential Option for the Poor
</p><p>
</p><p>The principle of the universal destination of goods requires that the poor and the marginalised should be the focus of particular concern. We imitate Christ by a loving preference for the poor, inspiring us to embrace the hungry, the needy, the homeless, those without healthcare, and those without hope of a better future.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Catechism (103) makes this abundantly clear: “Our Lord warns us that we shall be separated from him if we fail to meet the serious needs of the poor and the little ones who are his brethren.” It further states (2248) that the Church, “since her origin and in spite of the failing of many of her members, has not ceased to work their [the poor] relief, defence and liberation through numerous works of charity which remain indispensable always and everywhere.”
</p><p>
</p><p>The Church’s love for the poor is inspired by the Gospel of the Beatitudes, the poverty of Jesus and his attention to the poor. The Church teaches that one should assist one’s fellow man in his various needs and fill the human community with countless works of corporal and spiritual mercy.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>                  The Lorax was a children book that was written by Dr. Seuss  and was first released and published in 1971. It was soon adapted into a movie on 2012. The Lorax portrays an example of the Tragedy of the Commons. It shows each person's ambition and success for their own self-interest. The movie shows how people use nature to use it as an advantage for their uses without keeping in mind the good for the humanity and society. In the present times, the illegal logging and the global warming ar also an example of Tragedy of the Commons. Tragedy of the Commons are a result of the selfishness of the individual in the society. People use illegal logging for their own good without considering the effect of it in the community. The movie was a cautionary tale of what happens when you take too much and give too little back to the environment. The Lorax was an imperative lesson for children in particular who didn't have the feeling of being lectured about our real world but will fully understand how important it is not to destroy out of greed. In conclusion, the movie illustrates that it is important to show respect for the environment and all living creatures so that it will help us preserve the planet for ourselves and future generations.</p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong><p></p><br />
