                                            deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. they clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. they also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. in the past fifty years, more than half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. one solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. if you use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. how can you use less paper? one answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. a second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. the backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. a final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. most schools, offices, and districts have recycling center. if you follow the three rs – reduce, reuse, and recycle –, you can help save the world’s forests

All of them are feathered, winged, bipedal (meaning: having two legs), egg-laying, warm blooded, vertebrate animals belonging to the class Aves. They are an important part of the ecosystem and are present across the globe from the Arctic to the Antarctic.Birds inhabit the environment that suits them and that is what separates the species found in Polar Regions from those in the Tropical Region. In spite of all the similarities that the bird species share, they have certain unique characteristics which differentiate them from others.Birds may be of different sizes. They could be small as much as 2 inches (e.g. Bee hummingbird) to as big as 2.75 meters (like an Ostrich). Fossil records indicate the emergence of birds to as old as 160 million years ago.Some characteristics of modern birds are feathers, beak, egg-laying, high metabolic rate, four-chambered heart, light weight but strong skeleton. Wings which are actually evolved forelimbs help the birds in their flight. The unique digestive and respiratory system of the birds help them fly to great heights.Some birds cannot fly, penguin is one such species. Certain birds are known to be highly intelligent like parrots and corvids, while some are capable of transmitting knowledge across generations. The way certain birds create very intricately woven and safe nests to preserve their eggs indicates the use of manufacturing skills they possess.Birds are very closely connected with the environment. They are known to be intuitive about weather conditions that may prevail in the region much ahead than humans can predict it with any forecast methods and instruments. Their monitoring and careful examination is also used as an indicator of the weather conditions.Presence of peacock symbolizes rain and good weather while owls, bats and vultures are said to indicate a bad, unpleasant weather in an area. Certain birds are kept near coal mines for the prediction of mine explosion, as birds are sensitive to the release of high levels of carbon monoxide beyond permitted limits and begin to die.Birds are social. Most communication happens through sounds that they make or singing that they do. They live in flocks, hunt, breed cooperatively and participate in social behaviors.Birds incubate the eggs they lay and take longer care of the hatched birds as parents. Birds have the freedom to move anywhere they want and care for no boundaries of political or cultural divide except the suitability of the environment.Many birds have been extinct due to hunting, poaching, disturbed ecological balance and many more are under constant threat of extinction. Even birds living in water like swans, ducks etc. have seen a drastic fall in numbers because of the pollutants like poisonous chemicals and pesticides being constantly added to the water bodies. Also birds living close to the river banks consume polluted water and die.As birds are vital to the balance of this ecosystem, we must take adequate steps to preserve them providing them safe and clean habitat for survival.​</a>

                                            Activity 3: Analyze and evaluate the persuasive essay below by following the given instructions. Lockers for Everyone What would you think if you had to put your personal belongings in a crate, and every time you tum around something of yours were stolen? That is why I think students should have lockers. To protect their things, keep their things somewhere clean, and so they won't have to complain about carrying everything at once. Students should have lockers because it will stop people from stealing their stuff. For example, the children will not have to worry about their books, homework assignments, and personal belongings being stolen. The reason for this is that the children will have their own lockers plus their own locks, which only they have the combination to. This will reduce cases where things are being stolen. Students also should have lockers so they will have a clean place to put their books. What I mean by this is that many desks are rusty and have gum stuck under them. Also, if you put you stuff into a crate then it is easily collecting dust. This connects to my argument because their stuff will be kept very clean in a neat environment if students are given lockers to use My final reason why I think students should have lockers is so students won't complain about caring everything at once. The things that they may be caring everyday are very heavy. This is important because students may suffer health problems from having to carry all their stuff everywhere. Why carry books everyday why you can eliminate the pain by having a locker to store the things you don't need? Also, they're always whining about having to carry all their books. If we had lockers everyone would be happier. In conclusion I think students should have lockers. If we have lockers stealing in school would go down, it would create a safe and clean place for students to put their things, and students would complain less and be healthier. If we had lockers, the school would be a happier place for everyone. If you don't want your things stolen, contact your principal and demand lockers for your school. Instructions: 1.

                            5. deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. they clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. they also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. in the past fifty years, more than half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. one solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. if you use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. how can you use less paper? one answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. a second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. the backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. a final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. most schools, offices, and districts have recycling center. if you follow the three rs – reduce, reuse, and recycle –, you can help save the world’s forests

                            6. Essay about producing new scientist through innovations, competitions and inventions for the sustainability for clean and green environment to save mother earth.</h2><br />
                        <p>The making of a scientists often involves finishing at least a four-year degree from a tertiary education institution. Most of the time, students are immersed in books and lectures. What if we can <strong>produce new scientists through innovations, competitions, and inventions to guarantee the sustainability of a clean and green environment and thus saving mother earth?
</strong></p><p>Learning is never only about reading books; it is also about being motivated to remember and practice an information, concept, or skill. If students simply memorize theories from books, chances are they would forget this, and by the time they need it for actual use, they will have to review and thus waste time. An innovative way of making new scientists would mean straying away from the usual lecture and notes methods and moving to new methods like experiential learning. <strong>Producing new scientists through innovations </strong>can be tricky and doing so requires teachers to be creative enough to figure out new methods to educate students. However, this is important because the environment in which students grow and develop influences how they turn out, so if they are trained in an innovative manner, they are likely to be innovative.  </p><p>Similarly, when students are pitched against each other to compete, they are often motivated to do their best. Of course, who would say no to a quiz contest with an exemption in the final exam as a reward? However, while many students are motivated by competition, John Shindler (2009) in his book Transformative Classroom Management notes that makes learners focus on the outcome and not on the process; it also weakens the intrinsic motivation of students not to mention it increases anxiety. Worse, Shindler notes that it develops ‘fear of failure’ in students. This would not be a good quality for scientists since they should go through a series of failed experiments before they arrive at the appropriate outcome. Hence, in developing new scientists, competition may help in teamwork, but too much of it could be dangerous to the individual.  </p><p>In learning, assessment is the most important. The most common forms of assessments would be written exams. However, if we are breeding scientists, practical ones in which they apply what they have so far learned would be a guarantee of their potentials. An invention would be a suitable form of assessment. They must be able to put together something functional to prove that all their years of learning have not been put into waste.
</p><p>Since we are breeding innovative, competitive, and inventive new scientists, we are given hope that the environment could be saved by this new blood of scientists. Exposing them at a young age to the value of protecting the environment will help them focus on agendas related to sustainability of  a clean and green environment. Hence, part of the innovative ways of teaching them would be best related to preserving the environment. They may be asked to compete on topics related to the environment. Finally, they may be asked to invent something for the environment. If such information is gradually implanted in them from a young age, students would grow with much concern for the environment, and these new scientists leave the institution ready to save mother earth.  </p><p>The new scientists bred through innovation, competition, and invention, could easily show <strong>how science could save humanity </strong>and mother earth.  </p><p>Read Related Topics

Create kayo ng outline (either topic outline or sentence outline) based sa essay na ito. :)BirdsBy Pragati GhoshBirds are special kind of animal species with certain specific characteristics that are common to all of them. All of them are feathered, winged, bipedal (meaning: having two legs), egg-laying, warm blooded, vertebrate animals belonging to the class Aves. They are an important part of the ecosystem and are present across the globe from the Arctic to the Antarctic.Birds inhabit the environment that suits them and that is what separates the species found in Polar Regions from those in the Tropical Region. In spite of all the similarities that the bird species share, they have certain unique characteristics which differentiate them from others.Birds may be of different sizes. They could be small as much as 2 inches (e.g. Bee hummingbird) to as big as 2.75 meters (like an Ostrich). Fossil records indicate the emergence of birds to as old as 160 million years ago.Some characteristics of modern birds are feathers, beak, egg-laying, high metabolic rate, four-chambered heart, light weight but strong skeleton. Wings which are actually evolved forelimbs help the birds in their flight. The unique digestive and respiratory system of the birds help them fly to great heights.Some birds cannot fly, penguin is one such species. Certain birds are known to be highly intelligent like parrots and corvids, while some are capable of transmitting knowledge across generations. The way certain birds create very intricately woven and safe nests to preserve their eggs indicates the use of manufacturing skills they possess.Birds are very closely connected with the environment. They are known to be intuitive about weather conditions that may prevail in the region much ahead than humans can predict it with any forecast methods and instruments. Their monitoring and careful examination is also used as an indicator of the weather conditions.Presence of peacock symbolizes rain and good weather while owls, bats and vultures are said to indicate a bad, unpleasant weather in an area. Certain birds are kept near coal mines for the prediction of mine explosion, as birds are sensitive to the release of high levels of carbon monoxide beyond permitted limits and begin to die.Birds are social. Most communication happens through sounds that they make or singing that they do. They live in flocks, hunt, breed cooperatively and participate in social behaviors.Birds incubate the eggs they lay and take longer care of the hatched birds as parents. Birds have the freedom to move anywhere they want and care for no boundaries of political or cultural divide except the suitability of the environment.Many birds have been extinct due to hunting, poaching, disturbed ecological balance and many more are under constant threat of extinction. Even birds living in water like swans, ducks etc. have seen a drastic fall in numbers because of the pollutants like poisonous chemicals and pesticides being constantly added to the water bodies. Also birds living close to the river banks consume polluted water and die.As birds are vital to the balance of this ecosystem, we must take adequate steps to preserve them providing them safe and clean habitat for survival.​</h2><br />

                            12. Activity 3: Analyze and evaluate the persuasive essay below by following the given instructions. Lockers for Everyone What would you think if you had to put your personal belongings in a crate, and every time you tum around something of yours were stolen? That is why I think students should have lockers. To protect their things, keep their things somewhere clean, and so they won't have to complain about carrying everything at once. Students should have lockers because it will stop people from stealing their stuff. For example, the children will not have to worry about their books, homework assignments, and personal belongings being stolen. The reason for this is that the children will have their own lockers plus their own locks, which only they have the combination to. This will reduce cases where things are being stolen. Students also should have lockers so they will have a clean place to put their books. What I mean by this is that many desks are rusty and have gum stuck under them. Also, if you put you stuff into a crate then it is easily collecting dust. This connects to my argument because their stuff will be kept very clean in a neat environment if students are given lockers to use My final reason why I think students should have lockers is so students won't complain about caring everything at once. The things that they may be caring everyday are very heavy. This is important because students may suffer health problems from having to carry all their stuff everywhere. Why carry books everyday why you can eliminate the pain by having a locker to store the things you don't need? Also, they're always whining about having to carry all their books. If we had lockers everyone would be happier. In conclusion I think students should have lockers. If we have lockers stealing in school would go down, it would create a safe and clean place for students to put their things, and students would complain less and be healthier. If we had lockers, the school would be a happier place for everyone. If you don't want your things stolen, contact your principal and demand lockers for your school. Instructions: 1.
