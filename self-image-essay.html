                                            since the beginning of time, beauty standards have been defined and coveted. Every time standards change, the current generation’s perception of themselves does, too. For my generation, our butts aren’t big enough, our stomachs aren’t flat enough and our bodies aren’t curvy enough. For the generation before us, their hair wasn’t big enough or their butts flat enough. The common denominator is that these standards have a negative effect on those who are exposed to them. It especially affects teens and pre-teens, as they are just coming into who they are, and self-image is a large part of this. According to the Park Nicollet Melrose Center, 53 percent of thirteen-year-old American girls are unhappy with their bodies. The number increases to 78 percent by the time they reach 17.  A negative self-image can not only contribute to several mental illnesses and disorders, but problems that last a lifetime. It’s extremely hard to combat insecurity once you’ve dealt with it before. A 2010 study focused on girls ages 13 to 17 found nine out of 10 girls felt pressured by the media and fashion industries to be skinny. The media is a constant reminder of the narrow definition of what beauty has become. Places like Victoria’s Secret who denounce plus-size women who they don’t “market” to when they’re one of the biggest beauty stores in the world play a large part in this. You also have stores whose sizes run smaller than what is normal, bringing on insecure thoughts. The biggest problem is the media. Teens and pre-teens spend most of their time on social media, looking at these ridiculous body goals and looks. These images are doctored, airbrushed and usually heavily-edited. I have no problem with anyone who gets plastic surgery, but what about the girls who see those bodies and compare themselves? It’s unhealthy, at the very least. Subscribing to these images can only have a negative effect on these young women who are still growing into who they are, in a stage of their life already plagued with enough self-doubt. Magazines are not exempt from this problem. Magazines are largely digital these days, and they also utilize the various practices of editing the images they put out. In fact, magazines are the professionals at this. Magazine editors often lighten skin colors, take in hips and lengthen legs — the list goes on. American actress Zendaya was a victim of such manipulation in 2015. The singer called out Modeliste magazine for editing her body in images shot for the issue. The then 19-year-old wrote on Instagram, “Had a new shoot come out today and was shocked when I found my 19 year old hips and torso quite manipulated. These are the things that make women self conscious, that create the unrealistic ideals of beauty that we have.” The images are not without implications at all, and it’s irresponsible for those charged with creating the current images of beauty to keep putting them out. Why publish an image of someone who doesn’t even look like the image? It only helps to foster unhealthy thought processes, low self-esteem and problems for people growing up alongside them. make a reflection essay of that story​</a>

Although the subtitle has been dropped from most modern editions, the allusive qualities of Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus, is a horror novel by Mary Shelley, still remain. The reference here to the Titan Prometheus relies on centuries of interpretation through Greek myth and drama. Often seen as symbolizing the danger present when human knowledge oversteps its boundaries, Prometheus and what he represents are reflected in the product of Victor Frankenstein's ghastly experiments.2. Gregory Maguire's novel Wicked. The novel was inspired by L. Frank Baum's 1939 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Inspired by the omitted story of how the Wicked Witch came to be wicked, Maguire created a story which defined the Wicked Witch's beginning 3. The Maenads Dionysus presided over fertility both for the vineyards and for women's wombs. His followers, predominantly female, were known as Maenads -meaning "raving ones". These women shared their god's love of wine and raucous behaviour, and he encouraged them to indulge in both. Marauding bands of Maenads terrorized the Theban countryside so much that Pentheus, the King of Thebes, banned the cult of Dionysus. The king's decree was angrily rejected by many women - including the king's own mother - who went out into the countryside to praise the wine-god in one last, climactic rite. Dionysus convinced Pentheus to climb a tree to enjoy the view of the final orgy. Dressed in women's clothes, the king went to watch, but was seen by the ecstatic Maenads. Mistaking him for a wild animal, they tore him limb from limb. See also: The Olympian gods. The many affairs of Zeus. Vesta and Priapus A complex god 4.

                                            Activity 2. Read and analyze the paragraphs below. Then answer the following questions: In many ways, fiction and non-fiction are different from each other. Fiction, which includes novels, short stories, poems and plays, interprets human experience through the presentation of fictitious persons or situations and not through actual truths about particular events or abstract relations between ideas and reality. It presents lifelike images of people and events to embody truths about man and the human condition. On the other hand, nonfiction such as essays and biographies present or interpret facts, experiences, ideas or events, and make us appreciate the strangeness, the humor or the tragedy inherent in or connected with them. It discusses factual information and ideas to satisfy people's need for understanding and cognition. Individualistic and collectivist cultures vary in many ways. Members of an individualistic culture view their primary responsibility as helping themselves, whereas people in collective cultures feel loyalties and obligations to an in-group or one's extended family, community or organization. Individualistic cultures are also characterized by self-reliance and competition while members of a collective culture are more attentive to and concerned with the welfare of significant others. In handling disagreements, individualistic societies are relatively tolerant of conflicts and use a direct, solution - oriented approach. In contrast, members of collective cultures are less direct. Collective societies produce team players while individualistic ones are far more likely to produce and reward superstars. 1 - 2. What way of organizing a comparison and contrast is shown in paragraph 1? In paragraph 2? 3.-4. What transitional words or cohesive devices are used in paragraph1? What about in paragraph 2?​</a>

Seventeenth-century images emphasized the title character’s pompous folly as well as the often rough-and-tumble action of many episodes. The windmill scene, in which Don Quixote mistakes the technology that grinds the grain produced in the semi-arid Manchegan landscape for giants, became immediately iconic. The first representation of the scene appears in a Frankfurt edition of 1648, in which the windmill sail stabs Don Quixote. 
What type of description is used in the paragraph?
The correct answer is: Subjective description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag and off I went to collect my friends by way of bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. 
THE writer presented what point of view?
The correct answer is: First person

Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be.
What narrative device was used in the paragraph?
The correct answer is: Flashback
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Socialization affects us in so many ways far beyond the visible. Our individual socialization patterns shape our mentalities. The things we individual experiences in society directly affect our minds, which explains how our minds register and react to incidents and situations we encounter differently.Socialization is the lifelong process of inheriting and disseminating norms, customs and ideologies, providing an individual with the skills and habits necessary for participating within his or her own society. ... It is the behavioral patterns reinforced by socializing agents of society.Without socialization, we could not have our society and culture. And without social interaction, we could not have socialization. Our example of a socially isolated child was hypothetical, but real-life examples of such children, often called feral.</p><br />

                            7. since the beginning of time, beauty standards have been defined and coveted. Every time standards change, the current generation’s perception of themselves does, too. For my generation, our butts aren’t big enough, our stomachs aren’t flat enough and our bodies aren’t curvy enough. For the generation before us, their hair wasn’t big enough or their butts flat enough. The common denominator is that these standards have a negative effect on those who are exposed to them. It especially affects teens and pre-teens, as they are just coming into who they are, and self-image is a large part of this. According to the Park Nicollet Melrose Center, 53 percent of thirteen-year-old American girls are unhappy with their bodies. The number increases to 78 percent by the time they reach 17.  A negative self-image can not only contribute to several mental illnesses and disorders, but problems that last a lifetime. It’s extremely hard to combat insecurity once you’ve dealt with it before. A 2010 study focused on girls ages 13 to 17 found nine out of 10 girls felt pressured by the media and fashion industries to be skinny. The media is a constant reminder of the narrow definition of what beauty has become. Places like Victoria’s Secret who denounce plus-size women who they don’t “market” to when they’re one of the biggest beauty stores in the world play a large part in this. You also have stores whose sizes run smaller than what is normal, bringing on insecure thoughts. The biggest problem is the media. Teens and pre-teens spend most of their time on social media, looking at these ridiculous body goals and looks. These images are doctored, airbrushed and usually heavily-edited. I have no problem with anyone who gets plastic surgery, but what about the girls who see those bodies and compare themselves? It’s unhealthy, at the very least. Subscribing to these images can only have a negative effect on these young women who are still growing into who they are, in a stage of their life already plagued with enough self-doubt. Magazines are not exempt from this problem. Magazines are largely digital these days, and they also utilize the various practices of editing the images they put out. In fact, magazines are the professionals at this. Magazine editors often lighten skin colors, take in hips and lengthen legs — the list goes on. American actress Zendaya was a victim of such manipulation in 2015. The singer called out Modeliste magazine for editing her body in images shot for the issue. The then 19-year-old wrote on Instagram, “Had a new shoot come out today and was shocked when I found my 19 year old hips and torso quite manipulated. These are the things that make women self conscious, that create the unrealistic ideals of beauty that we have.” The images are not without implications at all, and it’s irresponsible for those charged with creating the current images of beauty to keep putting them out. Why publish an image of someone who doesn’t even look like the image? It only helps to foster unhealthy thought processes, low self-esteem and problems for people growing up alongside them. make a reflection essay of that story​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Socialization</strong> affects us in so many ways far beyond what we see,  including <strong>self-image</strong>. Our socialization patterns shape our <strong>state of mind</strong>. Personal experiences while interacting within society directly affect our reactions to every encounter as our minds recall previous events. Your self-image is a <strong>conceptual picture of yourself</strong>, both as a physical body and an individual. A<strong> healthy body image</strong> means that you know who you are, feel confident in your skin, and understand your full potential.

</p>Elements and Dimensions of Self-Image
<p>These are the proposed elements and dimensions of self-image (Oltmann, 2014):
</p><p>The three <strong>elements of a person’s self-image</strong> are:
</p>The way a person perceives oneself.
The way a person interprets another person’s perceptions of him or her.
The perception of the ideal self.
<p>The six <strong>dimensions of a person’s self-image</strong> are:
</p>Physical dimension
Psychological dimension
Intellectual dimension
Skills dimension
Moral dimension

</p>Examples of Positive and Negative Self-Image
<p>A <strong>positive self-image </strong>is having a good judgment of yourself; for example:
</p>Seeing yourself as a good-looking and desirable person.
Having an image of yourself as a smart and intellectual person.
Seeing a joyful, fit, and healthy person when you look in the mirror.
Believing that you are at best to your ideal self.
Thinking that others recognize you as a person as well as yourself.
<p>On the other hand, <strong>negative self-image</strong> is the reverse of the above; it looks like:

Having an image of yourself having below-average intelligence.
Seeing an unhappy and pale-looking when you look in the mirror.
Believing that you are not your ideal version of yourself.
Thinking that others do not recognize you as a person as well as yourself.

Although the subtitle has been dropped from most modern editions, the allusive qualities of Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus, is a horror novel by Mary Shelley, still remain. The reference here to the Titan Prometheus relies on centuries of interpretation through Greek myth and drama. Often seen as symbolizing the danger present when human knowledge oversteps its boundaries, Prometheus and what he represents are reflected in the product of Victor Frankenstein's ghastly experiments.2. Gregory Maguire's novel Wicked. The novel was inspired by L. Frank Baum's 1939 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Inspired by the omitted story of how the Wicked Witch came to be wicked, Maguire created a story which defined the Wicked Witch's beginning 3. The Maenads Dionysus presided over fertility both for the vineyards and for women's wombs. His followers, predominantly female, were known as Maenads -meaning "raving ones". These women shared their god's love of wine and raucous behaviour, and he encouraged them to indulge in both. Marauding bands of Maenads terrorized the Theban countryside so much that Pentheus, the King of Thebes, banned the cult of Dionysus. The king's decree was angrily rejected by many women - including the king's own mother - who went out into the countryside to praise the wine-god in one last, climactic rite. Dionysus convinced Pentheus to climb a tree to enjoy the view of the final orgy. Dressed in women's clothes, the king went to watch, but was seen by the ecstatic Maenads. Mistaking him for a wild animal, they tore him limb from limb. See also: The Olympian gods. The many affairs of Zeus. Vesta and Priapus A complex god 4.

-Read the following example of a definition paragraph:  Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation.

                        The subjective description is a kind of description that is based on the personal perspective or view, opinions and comments. Falling action is the part of a story where the consequences or changes of situation start to arise. Simile is the figurative speech that shows two things exactly the same. First person pertains to the main character of the story. This is commonly the first introduced character or subject from the story. Flashback is the process of reminiscing or looking back from the past. It is part of stories sometimes. Denotation means the literal and true meaning and definition of words. Objective description is fact-based writing or description. The word "Narration" was derived from the latin word, narrare. <br />

                            18. Activity 2. Read and analyze the paragraphs below. Then answer the following questions: In many ways, fiction and non-fiction are different from each other. Fiction, which includes novels, short stories, poems and plays, interprets human experience through the presentation of fictitious persons or situations and not through actual truths about particular events or abstract relations between ideas and reality. It presents lifelike images of people and events to embody truths about man and the human condition. On the other hand, nonfiction such as essays and biographies present or interpret facts, experiences, ideas or events, and make us appreciate the strangeness, the humor or the tragedy inherent in or connected with them. It discusses factual information and ideas to satisfy people's need for understanding and cognition. Individualistic and collectivist cultures vary in many ways. Members of an individualistic culture view their primary responsibility as helping themselves, whereas people in collective cultures feel loyalties and obligations to an in-group or one's extended family, community or organization. Individualistic cultures are also characterized by self-reliance and competition while members of a collective culture are more attentive to and concerned with the welfare of significant others. In handling disagreements, individualistic societies are relatively tolerant of conflicts and use a direct, solution - oriented approach. In contrast, members of collective cultures are less direct. Collective societies produce team players while individualistic ones are far more likely to produce and reward superstars. 1 - 2. What way of organizing a comparison and contrast is shown in paragraph 1? In paragraph 2? 3.-4. What transitional words or cohesive devices are used in paragraph1? What about in paragraph 2?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A paragraph is a group of related sentences that support one main idea. In general, paragraphs consist of three parts: the topic sentence, body sentences, and the concluding or the bridge sentence to the next paragraph or section. Paragraphs show where the subdivisions of a research paper begin and end and, thus, help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>kaya mo po yan <p> </p>I need somebody who can love me in my worsr<br />

                            19. Refer to the given paragraph below, entitled “Picturing Don Quixote”: 
Seventeenth-century images emphasized the title character’s pompous folly as well as the often rough-and-tumble action of many episodes. The windmill scene, in which Don Quixote mistakes the technology that grinds the grain produced in the semi-arid Manchegan landscape for giants, became immediately iconic. The first representation of the scene appears in a Frankfurt edition of 1648, in which the windmill sail stabs Don Quixote.

In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag and off I went to collect my friends by way of bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. 
THE writer presented what point of view?
The correct answer is: First person
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be.
What narrative device was used in the paragraph?
The correct answer is: Flashback
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.
