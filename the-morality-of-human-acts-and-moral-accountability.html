                                            irection: Read the situation presented below. Make a moral decision on the dilemma presented below.Mr. Osorio is a professor at a prestigious university in Manila. He teaches Ethics to BSAccountancy students. Because of his hard work, his great knowledge on the subject, and his wit and humor, the students very much appreciated him because he makes the class lively and enjoyable. For this reason, he is known as the best teacher in the university. One day, after a class discussion on the topic regarding the value of honesty, three students made an admission in class they were involved in the series of thefts and robberies in the school's canteen and in other offices of the university. Because of the ethics class, the students felt guilty of their actions and promised to the class that they are not to do any acts of robbery anymore.These students told Mr. Osorio about how miserable their lives were and the reason why they robbed the school was because they wanted to cope with the expenses of the school and use some money to buy food for the family. However, because of the great amount that they have taken from the school and the impossibility of paying said amount back to the school, they will definitely be expelled. Expulsion eventually would mean that the three will not anymore be included in the list of graduating students and, therefore, the hope of helping their family financially at the soonest possible time will not be realized.As an ethics teacher, and being professional at that, it is the responsibility of Mr. Osorio to tell the administration about the case. After all, the whole class knows already the case. However, as a human person, it will be an act of charity if he will just let it pass by because, after all, they promised that they would not be doing it again. Should Mr. Osorio tell the school administration about the case? Why or why not? Explain your case.____________________________________________________________________________​</a>

Mr. Osorio is a professor at a prestigious university in Manila. He teaches Ethics to BS Accountancy students. Because of his hard work, his great knowledge on the subject, and his wit and humor, the students very much appreciated him because he makes the class lively and enjoyable. For this reason, he is known as the best teacher in the university.One day, after a class discussion on the topic regarding the value of honesty, three students made an admission in class they were involved in the series of thefts and robberies in the school's canteen and in other offices of the university. Because of the ethics class, the students felt guilty of their actions and promised to the class that they are not to do any acts of robbery anymore.These students told Mr Osorio about how miserable their lives were and the reason why they robbed the school was because they wanted to cope with the expenses of the school and use some money to buy food for the family. However, because of the great amount that they have taken from the school and the impossibility of paying said amount back to the school. they will definitely be expelled. Expulsion eventually would mean that the three will not anymore be included in the list of graduating students and, therefore, the hope of helping their family financially at the soonest possible time will not be realized. As an ethics teacher, and being professional at that, it is the responsibility of Mr. Osorio to tell the administration about the case. After all, the whole class knows already the case. However, as a human person, it will be an act of charity if he will just let it pass by because, after all, they promised that they would not be doing it again. Should Mr. Osorio tell the school administration about the case? Why or why not? Explain your case.​</a>

                            15. Direction: Read the situation presented below. Make a moral decision on the dilemma presented below. Mr. Osorio is a professor at a prestigious university in Manila. He teaches Ethics to BS Accountancy students. Because of his hard work, his great knowledge on the subject, and his wit and humor, the students very much appreciated him because he makes the class lively and enjoyable. For this reason, he is known as the best teacher in the university. One day, after a class discussion on the topic regarding the value of honesty, three students made an admission in class they were involved in the series of thefts and robberies in the school's canteen and in other offices of the university. Because of the ethics class, the students felt guilty of their actions and promised to the class that they are not to do any acts of robbery anymore. These students told Mr. Osorio about how miserable their lives were and the reason why they robbed the school was because they wanted to cope with the expenses of the school and use some money to buy food for the family. However, because of the great amount that they have taken from the school and the impossibility of paying said amount back to the school, they will definitely be expelled. Expulsion eventually would mean that the three will not anymore be included in the list of graduating students and, therefore, the hope of helping their family financially at the soonest possible time will not be realized. As an ethics teacher, and being professional at that, it is the responsibility of Mr. Osorio to tell the administration about the case. After all, the whole class knows already the case however, as a human person, it will be an act of charity if he will just let it pass by because, after all, they promised that they would not be doing it again. Should Mr. Osorio tell the school administration about the case? Why or why not? Explain your case. ​</h2><br />
