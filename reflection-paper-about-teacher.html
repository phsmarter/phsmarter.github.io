Before, an audio can be created and transmitted through tape, radio, or CD. Today, a different alternative is offered by the Internet - the podcast. You may have encountered the term in your previous lesson in Listening Strategies. It is a digital audio file that is posted on the Internet. For you to practice the guidelines in conducting an interview, interview an expert on any field (Example: teacher, nurse, engineer, etc.). Imagine you will produce a 5-minute informative podcast about your interviewee's expertise 1. First, copy and accomplish the template on "Interview Plan" in your paper. Then, provide the interviewee with a copy of the interview questions to allow him/her to prepare answers. Remember to use open-ended questions. (Example: What advice would you give someone who like to follow a similar career to yours?) Interview Plan Interviewer Purpose of interview: Interviewee:Information I know about the Interviewee: Job Position/Title: Workplace: Years in service/practice: Others: Possible Questions: 1. 2.3.4.5.Answers:1.2.3.4.5.2. If a smartphone or any sound recorder is available, you can use it to record the interview. You can use your recording to complete the last part of your Interview Plan where you will write your interviewee's answers. Remember to use a direct speech or write the exact answers of your interviewee. 3. After the interview, reflect on the questions that follow. Write your answers on your paper. ►► What was it like to interview someone? ►►Which of the tips or guidelines did you use, and how did it help you as an interviewer? ►► GOOD AND HELPFUL ANSWER = BRAINLIEST ►►NONSENSE ANSWER = REPORT!! ​</a>

                            8. What's In Directions: Summarize the following text below using any of the summarizing techniques. Write on a separate sheet of paper. Imagine being told you could not be an engineer or a truck driver, or even an airline pilot because 'girls don't do those jobs'. Imagine being told not to listen to that radio station because 'Bad Bay Elvis' and rock and roll music encouraged indecent behavior. Imagine putting on a tie or a hat and gloves to go out. These values and social conventions were generally accepted as 'correct' by parents of teenagers in the 1950s, and teenagers were not expected to question them. Before we complain about life in the 21st century we should look at how fortunate we are. Career choices for girls in the 1950s were mostly limited to becoming a hairdresser, nurse, or teacher, until they married. This would be unthinkable today. Women are having children in their late 30s not early 20s, and often their families are planned around their careers. In-co-educational schools girls often top the classes in Physics, Chemistry Technology, or Mathematics - traditionally scen as boys' subjccts. When the army recruitment officer visits, as many girls as boys are in the audience. Achieving your potential is no longer limited by your gender, and this must be a good thing. Another aspect of modern teenage life that reflects these immense social changes is in what is acceptable to wear. You might say that 'anything goes'. If you look at any group of teenagers wearing mufti you will see many different personal styles. One person has four or five body piercings, another has dreadlocked hair, the third shows off his boxers above his low-slung jeans; and 3​</h2><br />
