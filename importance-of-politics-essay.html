                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Politics is the way that people living in groups make decisions. ... In everyday life, the term "politics" refers to the way that countries are governed, and to the ways that governments make rules and laws. Politics can also be seen in other groups, such as in companies, clubs, schools, and churches.
</p><p>  </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In political science, a political system defines the process for making official government decisions. It is usually compared to the legal system, economic system, cultural system, and other social systems.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>It is very important to care about politics because you should know what is going on around you. Also, it is important to have a say in what is going on around you. The political decisions people make will affect many lives. Many people see politics as the government and the laws being made, and that is true, but it is way more complicated than that. Every law that is made will impact many. Sometimes the decisions will affect people in a bad way. Every vote that you make will either break people or make people.</p><p></p><p>One reason you should care about politics is because you should always know what is going on around you. For example, if a new law is made is made in your area, you might want to make sure that you and the people around you know that a new law has been made so that no one breaks the law without even knowing it. Also, if something dangerous is happening around you or someone you know, you want to be aware if someone is breaking the law. It is very important to know what is happening around you.</p><p></p><p>Another reason you should care about politics is because you should have a say in what will happen. Everyone should have a say in what will happen, because we all live side by side with each other, and it would not be fair if someone was left out. Also, each vote makes a difference in the ways that we live. It is always important to to share your opinion. The way you vote will affect many people, and their everyday life.</p><br />

                            9. An important political movement during this period is nationalism. How are you going to show your nationalism during this period? Create an essay about your answer.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Nationalism</strong>, ideology based on the premise that the individual’s loyalty and devotion to the nation-state surpass other individual or group interests.</p><p></p><p><strong>The modern nature of nationalism</strong>
</p><p>Nationalism is a modern movement. Throughout history, people have been attached to their native soil, to the traditions of their parents, and to established territorial authorities, but it was not until the end of the 18th century that nationalism began to be a generally recognized sentiment molding public and private life and one of the great, if not the greatest, single determining factors of modern history. Because of its dynamic vitality and its all-pervading character, nationalism is often thought to be very old; sometimes it is mistakenly regarded as a permanent factor in political behaviour. Actually, the American and French revolutions may be regarded as their first powerful manifestations. After penetrating the new countries of Latin America, it spread in the early 19th century to central Europe and from there, toward the middle of the century, to eastern and southeastern Europe. At the beginning of the 20th century, nationalism flowered in Asia and Africa. Thus, the 19th century has been called the age of nationalism in Europe, while the 20th century witnessed the rise and struggle of powerful national movements throughout Asia and Africa.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Identification of state and people</strong>
</p><p>Nationalism, translated into world politics, implies the identification of the state or nation with the people—or at least the desirability of determining the extent of the state according to ethnographic principles. In the age of nationalism, but only in the age of nationalism, the principle was generally recognized that each nationality should form a state—its state—and that the state should include all members of that nationality. Formerly states, or territories under one administration, were not delineated by nationality. People did not give their loyalty to the nation-state but to other, different forms of political organization: the city-state, the feudal fief, and its lord, the dynastic state, the religious group, or the sect. The nation-state was nonexistent during the greater part of history, and for a very long time, it was not even regarded as an ideal. In the first 15 centuries of the Common Era, the ideal was the universal world-state, not loyalty to any separate political entity. The Roman Empire had set a great example, which survived not only in the Holy Roman Empire of the Middle Ages but also in the concept of the res publica Christiana <strong>(“Christian republic” or community) </strong>and in its later secularized form of united world civilization.</p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Why is politics so important? Because it's easy for senators, governors, mayors or presidents to control the country to their liking, add, remove, or change laws, and even try to maintain order before a huge riot appears. But it's not as easy as it looks. With mounting problems and possible financial difficulties making it real hard to rule the republic/democracy, chances are any kind of order will collapse. So, we need to look for the one that we really trust and depend on in order to decrease the chances of those happening.</p><p></p><br />

                            23. ESSAY: How important is the balance between political and economic institutions and how they can contribute in terms of building the country? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cross-country empirical analyses, in combination with micro-level studies, provide strong support for the overwhelming importance of institutions in predicting the level of development in countries around the world (Hall and Jones, 1999; Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson, 2001). Protection of property rights, effective law enforcement, and efficient bureaucracies, together with a broad range of norms and civic mores, are found to be strongly correlated to better economic performance over time. This essay aims to explain why institutions are important to economic development and to provide evidence for the arguments made. It argues that institutions support economic development through four broad channels: determining the costs of economic transactions, determining the degree of appropriability of return to investment, determining the level for oppression and expropriation, and determining the degree to which the environment is conducive to cooperation and increased social capital. Evidence is derived from the literature, from comparison of countries, and from examples at the micro level.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Why is culture important in our society essay?
Why is it important to understand culture society and politics?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>-because culture influences development from the moment we're born, making an impact on us as we grow. For instance, culture can affect how children build values, language, belief systems, and an understanding of themselves as individuals and as members of society.</p><p>-because cultural heritage is central to protecting our sense of who we are. It gives us an irrefutable connection to the past – to certain social values, beliefs, customs and traditions, that allows us to identify ourselves with others and deepen our sense of unity, belonging and national pride.</p><p>- because culture plays an essential role in the life of a person and society. It acts as a means of accumulation, storage, and transmission of human experience. It is the culture that shapes people into who they are as they gain knowledge, learn the language, symbols, values, norms, customs, and traditions</p><p>-because knowing how society works as a whole and as part of our life helps us find a better way to improve it or keep it alive. The well-being of the country can also be seen in society.</p><br />
