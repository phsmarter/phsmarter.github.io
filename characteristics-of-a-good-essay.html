                        <p>A good student is the one who can work in a group, motivate others and yield productive output. Being positive, helpful, cooperative and friendly are all the traits of a good student. Such students become great team players and leaders when they grow up. A good student will always be illustrious of his/her attitude, diligence, discipline, mindfulness and self-confidence. Read about the qualities and how these qualities help you to be a good student. A good student is one who reflects on how his/her learning is causing personal change.  Whether that change is in knowledge, attitude, skill-level or behavior, the good student takes time to note how their interaction with the discipline has moved them from where they once stood.</p><p></p><p>All students have the potential to be “good” students; it comes down to choices.  Students who make good choices tend to do better in their academics and extracurricular activities.  These good choices then transfer from their school day to all aspects of their lives.  It all comes down to character and doing what’s right, especially when it’s not easy.  Good students set goals and work hard to follow through to their individual potentials.  Good students seek out help when needed and assist others without hesitation or being asked.  Basically, good students are role models of good choices.</p><p></p><p>I would describe a good student as a student who comes to class and does his or her best on gathering as much information as they can and are willing to help and collaborate with others. They utilize their time wisely in class and understand the importance of time management. A good student will always be on time and present. They will advocate for themselves and others. They will be prepared for class and be resilient in their quest for learning as much as possible instead of just securing the correct answer. The good student will understand the relevance to the purpose of learning new information and make it connect to their lives. They don’t necessarily have to have the highest grade in the class, but having the above-mentioned qualities will certainly lead to academic success.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#BetterWithBrainly</strong></p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong></p><p></p><br />

How will you become a good dressmaker?</p><p></p><p>To become a good dressmaker, there are several skills and qualities that one should acquire and develop. Firstly, one must have a strong foundation in sewing and a good eye for measurements and details. This requires a lot of practice and patience, and it's important to keep learning and improving one's skills by trying out different techniques and styles.</p><p></p><p>In addition to technical skills, a good dressmaker must possess creativity and imagination to come up with unique designs and ideas. They should also have good communication skills so that they can effectively listen to their client's needs and communicate their vision and ideas.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a good dressmaker must have a strong work ethic and attention to detail. They should be able to manage their time well and meet deadlines, as well as ensure that every stitch and seam is flawless.</p><p></p><p>2. Why is it important for a dressmaker to possess the characteristics of being patient?</p><p></p><p>Patience is a key characteristic for dressmakers as it can determine the outcome of a project. Sewing requires a lot of attention to detail and precision, which can be very time-consuming. A dressmaker who lacks patience may rush through the process, resulting in a poorly constructed and unattractive garment.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, creating a custom piece of clothing can be a collaborative effort between the dressmaker and the client. This may involve multiple fittings and adjustments, which can be frustrating and time-consuming. A patient dressmaker will be better equipped to work with the client and make the necessary changes without getting flustered or rushing the project.</p><p></p><p>Overall, patience is an essential quality for dressmakers as it allows them to create high-quality garments that meet the client's needs and expectations. It ensures that every detail is carefully considered and executed, resulting in a beautiful and functional garment.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa brainliest po thank you </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.➪Dressmakers help people enhance their body assets and hide their flaws. Just like makeup, clothes are the basic things that can help in enhancing whatever asset a person has and be able to hide whatever flaws that person wants to keep private.</p><p></p><p>2.➪The difference between a tailor and dressmaker is primarily their clientele. A dressmaker specialises in clothes for women, and a tailor generally makes clothes for men. Males and females have different body shapes that call for a different approach to pattern making, garment cutting and construction.</p><p></p><p>3.➪</p><p>•Patience</p><p></p><p>Patience is something tailors have to essentially possess. There will be different orders for different types of clothes. Further, there will be clients who are demanding and some of them can have bad attitudes. A dressmaker will always be patient and professional regardless of the situation he or she is and handle things calmly.</p><p></p><p>•Creativity</p><p></p><p>Dressmakers usually don’t limit themselves to one particular method or design. A good dressmaker will always make sure to add a little bit of creativity into the work produced by him or her. For an instance, if the dressmaker has to create a best tailor in Bangkok out of scratch, it will not be done well without creativity. The creativeness of the dressmaker is what adds more value to the clothes that they produce.</p><p></p><p>•Attention to details</p><p></p><p>A good dressmaker will always make sure to pay attention to even the smallest of the details. They get many orders from different clients for made to measure shirts and the requirements for orders will certainly differ. Therefore, a dressmaker will make sure to give his or her fullest attention. This is important and any good professional will ensure this because otherwise can lead to mistakes and loss of clients.</p><p></p><p>•Knowledge</p><p></p><p>A good dressmaker will be a well- knowledgeable person and will know what he is doing. Dressmaking is a constant process of learning and only a true professional will know what needs to be done in problematic situations. This comes with knowledge and experience.</p><p></p><p>•Working on time</p><p></p><p>Working on time is essential for any profession. A good dressmaker will make sure that the given orders are ready to be handed over to the customers on time. This is essential in order to retain customers.</p><p></p><br />
