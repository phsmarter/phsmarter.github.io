Introduction: Education is more than important than just learning in books and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score.a good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult.education may teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1 The biggest selling point for for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn how to learn it is not about the knowledge they accumulate .it is the way a child is thought how to learn things,a child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course but if that child has been taught how to learn,then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life otherwise that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because .he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things persuasive point 2 education teaches people how to reason and if they are taught how to reason well,then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance.for example there are lots of post and websites on the internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are ignorant people than never learned how to reason will lock at them.believe them and support them if a person taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the us taht have had childhood injections (most of them) amd then look at all the people with autism.They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in us would have autism.if a person taught how to reason then taht person then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke.they would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema.this sort of reasoning can be taught in schools,and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children's lives by not vaccinating them and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him persuasive point 4 conclusion if education is not seen as important,then one day it just will be all about,school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum.there will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this alreay happens in some cases).plus, without education teaching people how to how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate waht is fact from what is faulty evidence,then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under cut ignorant noises ​</a>

                                            Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers.

                                            Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he orshe cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 4 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses.

They also showed us how they are being deprived of having a better education. In life, education is the most important thing for a person. It is said to be the key to life. It is sad to hear that many people don’t receive the same learning than other people just because of their difference to them. We must break the stereotypes and the labels that was created ages ago. We are now in the modern society, we must create a change and just live a peaceful life. Just like what they say said “We all share the same universe”, so we must treat each and one of us equally and fairly. Equality needs to be spread around the world. ​</a>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Air pollution is one of the greatest scourges of our day, not only because of its contribution to global warming but also because of its effect on public and personal health due to increased sickness and death. Many contaminants are significant contributors to infectious diseases. Pollution is defined as the movement of risks associated with exposure to people as well as other living creatures into the surroundings. Human emissions pollute the water we consume, the environment in which we live, and the soil in which plants are grown, all of which have a harmful effect on the environment.

                            7. VARIOUS TEACHNIQUES TO SUMMARIZE ACADEMIC TEXTSDirections: Choose any of the 5 Easy Techniques in Summarizing Various Academic Texts, then summarize the essay 2 “Why is Education Important in Our Society?” on the space provided below.essay:why is education important In our society? Introduction: Education is more than important than just learning in books and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score.a good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult.education may teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1 The biggest selling point for for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn how to learn it is not about the knowledge they accumulate .it is the way a child is thought how to learn things,a child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course but if that child has been taught how to learn,then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life otherwise that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because .he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things persuasive point 2 education teaches people how to reason and if they are taught how to reason well,then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance.for example there are lots of post and websites on the internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are ignorant people than never learned how to reason will lock at them.believe them and support them if a person taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the us taht have had childhood injections (most of them) amd then look at all the people with autism.They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in us would have autism.if a person taught how to reason then taht person then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke.they would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema.this sort of reasoning can be taught in schools,and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children's lives by not vaccinating them and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him persuasive point 4 conclusion if education is not seen as important,then one day it just will be all about,school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum.there will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this alreay happens in some cases).plus, without education teaching people how to how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate waht is fact from what is faulty evidence,then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under cut ignorant noises ​</h2><br />

                            8. Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

In this narrative essay, we will explore the hypothetical scenario of a relationship never coming to be, and the potential consequences of that missed connection.</p><p></p><p>Beginning of the story:</p><p></p><p>It was a typical Friday night when we first crossed paths. I was out with some friends at a local bar, trying to forget about a recent breakup, when I saw him across the room. Our eyes met, and it was like everything else around us disappeared. We spent the rest of the night talking and laughing, and I knew that this was the beginning of something special.</p><p></p><p>Middle Events:</p><p></p><p>Over the next few months, our relationship blossomed. We went on adventures together, explored new places, and spent countless hours getting to know each other. We were inseparable, and I couldn't imagine my life without him.</p><p></p><p>But then, one day, everything changed. I received a job offer in another state, and I knew that I had to take it. We talked about it and decided that we would make it work, even though we would be long distance. But as the days went by, the distance between us seemed to grow. We started to drift apart, and eventually, we decided to break up.</p><p></p><p>Ending of the story:</p><p></p><p>I moved away and started my new job, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. I tried to move on and focus on my career, but I couldn't help but think about what could have been. I often found myself wondering, "What if we had never met?"</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In the end, I realized that our relationship was just one of many possible paths that my life could have taken. But even though things didn't work out between us, I will always be grateful for the time we spent together. Our relationship may have been brief, but it was filled with love, laughter, and countless memories. And who knows, maybe one day our paths will cross again and we can pick up where we left off. Until then, I will always cherish the time we had together.</p><p></p><p><strong>EDUCATION</strong></p><p></p><p>Title: The Power of Education: A What-If Scenario</p><p></p><p>Introduction: Education has always been a crucial aspect of human life. It has the power to shape our minds, broaden our horizons, and open up opportunities for us. But what if we did not have access to education? How would our lives be different? This is the question we aim to explore in this narrative essay.</p><p></p><p>Beginning of the story: Imagine a world where education was not considered important. Children were not encouraged to go to school, and those who did were often ridiculed for their efforts. In this world, the pursuit of knowledge was seen as a waste of time and resources.</p><p></p><p>Middle Events: As a result of this lack of emphasis on education, many people struggled to find jobs and make a decent living. They were trapped in a cycle of poverty and had little hope of breaking free. Those who did manage to secure jobs often had to settle for low-paying, unskilled positions.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, without access to education, many people were unable to learn the skills needed to adapt to a rapidly changing world. As technology advanced, they were left behind, unable to compete in the job market or even keep up with the world around them.</p><p></p><p>Ending of the story: Eventually, the lack of education began to take a toll on society. Crime rates increased, and people became more isolated and unhappy. The economy struggled, and the overall quality of life declined. It was clear that the absence of education had severely impacted the world in a negative way.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion: In conclusion, education is a powerful tool that has the ability to shape our lives for the better. Without it, we would be unable to compete in a rapidly changing world and would be more likely to face poverty, isolation, and unhappiness. It is crucial that we prioritize education and provide access to it for all individuals.</p><p></p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p></p><p>Greetings, mortal.

                            18. Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he orshe cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 4 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Why is Education Important in Our Society:<p>One of the benefits of education is that the educational system teaches us how to obtain and develop critical and logical thinking and make independent decisions. When children become adults, they are faced with a lot of challenging issues – pay off your student loans, get a job, buy a car and a house, provide for your family, etc. However, if one has spent years educating themselves, they should be able to make sound decisions on these various quandaries. Not only are people able to form their own opinions, but they are also good at finding solid and reliable arguments and evidence to back up and confirm their decisions. !!</p><br />

They also showed us how they are being deprived of having a better education. In life, education is the most important thing for a person. It is said to be the key to life. It is sad to hear that many people don’t receive the same learning than other people just because of their difference to them. We must break the stereotypes and the labels that was created ages ago. We are now in the modern society, we must create a change and just live a peaceful life. Just like what they say said “We all share the same universe”, so we must treat each and one of us equally and fairly. Equality needs to be spread around the world. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The video instructs us to treat everyone equally, no matter what color they have, what race they're from, how they appear, and what religion they follow. They also demonstrated how they are denied the opportunuty to receive a higher education. In our lives, education is the most essential thing a person that has in life. It is considered to be the key to life. It is disheartening to realize thst many people do not obtain the same education as others just because of their differences. We must extract the stereotypes and labels that was invented centuries ago. We are now living in a contemporary society, we must effect change and just live a tranquil life. As they put it, "we all share the same cosmos", so we must treat each of us equally and fairly. Equality should be spread around the world.</p><br />
