                                            Do this My name is Maria Angelina Bacarella. I was born on March 7, 1995, in Tawas City, Michigan. My parents are James and Michelle Bacarella, and I have three younger siblings, Sophia, Alex, and Samuel. I attended Holy Family Catholic School in East Tawas from kindergarten until sixth grade. While there I participated in band, choir, Girl Scouts, Council of Catholic Girls, volleyball, softball, and basketball. I was on honor roll and received an academic achievement award. Attending a catholic school helped me to grow academically, in my faith, and as a person, giving me high moral standards. In seventh and eighth grade I attended Tawas Junior High. I was involved in volleyball, basketball, softball, and Club PRIDE. I was on honor roll every semester, and received the presidential academic award. I currently attend Tawas High School. I am involved in losco Pride, Spanish club, liturgical dance, youth group, Student Senate, volleyball, soccer, and National Honor Society. I currently have a 3.88 cumulative G.P.A. and am 8th in my class of 117. Though my school, I go to coop every day for two hours in the 81st District court. While there I have learned many school that pertain to a future career in law. I file papers, type bonds, and observe court. This has given me first-hand experience identifying legal documents and understanding how to proceed in court. I am very motivated to create the best possible future for myself, and have worked very hard to set that up. I have been on the honor roll every marking period thus far in my high school career. I received my academics and athletics varsity letters, an honors pass, the hustle award for volleyball, and an academic achievement award. Some of my strengths include being a hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, and organized. My weaknesses are that sometimes I am overly ambitious and take on too much at once, and that I tend to expect too much of others. I have volunteered at local nursing homes, and for local churches. My favorite volunteer experience has been helping out with vacation bible school through my church. Through this I am able to help kids grow in their faith. Through losco PRIDE I am able to send a positive message in a fun way. I love these because they allow me to be a positive role model for kids. I currently work at Chick'n Dots Tiny Tots Boutique. My favorite thing about my job is that I get to work with children. I also babysit on the weekends and in the summer. Next year, I plan to attend Michigan State University. I hope to be involved in their college of social sciences, James Madison College to gain my bachelor's degree in International relations. During college I hope to study abroad to assist in my learning other languages. After college I would like to attend Michigan State University College of law. I hope to become an international lawyer someday, working for a company like USAID. With this line of work, I would be able to travel and work on projects to help people in other countries.1.

Find out what the article says about obligation, prohibition and permission.What is a strong family? It is a family that sustains, supports and nourishes each member of that family. A strong family unit has to create a safe, positive and supportive place for all members to thrive. Members of a strong family must able to utilize resources and live together in a fairly healthy manner. These are all possible descriptions for a strong family. Moreover, there are important elements that can create a strong family system namely cohesion, flexibility and communication.In a family, cohesion can be defined as the feeling of being loved, of belonging to the group, and of being nurtured. Although closeness within a family is good, there must be a balance between being together and being apart. To bring a family together, there must be commitment and quality bonding time among its members.Besides cohesion, there must be flexibility. or else the family becomes rigid and the authority figures are resented. Families that have a strong spiritual base seem to have a sense of well-being that facilitates working together in times of stress.Fill out the graphic organizer with statements from the article above expressing obligation, prohibition and permission. In case you did not find one for any of the three, just write NONE in the space provided. Use the graph illustration below as your pattern.

                                            QUARTER 1 MODULE 2 Directions: Read the passages below and determine how each is mainly structured. On a sheet of paper, answer the questions that follow and put the information from each passage in an appropriate graphic organizer. Feel free to make changes of the graphic organizer if necessary. Passage 1 Earthquakes happen all over the world in areas called seismic zones. Seismic zones occur where the plates of crust covering the Earth’s surface meet each other. Inside the Earth, the mantle is always moving, which in turn moves the plates. These plates push against each other, building up tension between them. When the tension between plates becomes too great, they grind against each other, causing the Earth’s surface to tremble and shake. Passage 2 I have noticed that a lot of people are confused about mobile data and Wi-fi. Some people think that they’re the same thing. Both mobile data and Wi-fi allow you to connect to the internet. However, there are some important differences between them. Mobile data is provided by the mobile phone company. Whereas, Wi-fi is comes through cable or phone lines. Mobile data gives you internet access anywhere that your phone can get a signal. But, you can only get Wi-fi access when you are near a router. Customers are usually given a nearly unlimited amount of Wi-fi data, like an all-you-can-eat buffet. On the other hand, mobile data is often sold in limited portions, like an expensive restaurant. It is important to know which you are using so that you aren’t charged additional fees for going over your mobile data plan limits. Passage 3 In the center of Luna’s Spoliarium painting are fallen gladiators being dragged by Roman soldiers. At the left side, spectators ardently await their chance to strip off the combatants of their metal helmets and other armory. In addition, emotions are featured on the left and the right side presents a sober mood. It can be seen also in the right side; an old man carries a torch perhaps searching for his son while a woman weeps the death of her loved one. Passage 4 The first step of changing oil in a car is to gather supplies. After you have collected all of the tools and supplies, prepare your vehicle. Start the car and let it run for one to two minutes to warm the oil and the engine. Then, find a flat surface to jack the vehicle from the center under the engine. Next, locate the oil filter and oil drain plug. Put on work gloves to protect your hands and position an oil drain pan under the engine then remove the plug the rest of the way. Passage 5 What is an ice cream headache? It is when a painful sensation resonates in your head after eating something cold (usually ice cream) on a hot day. This pain is produced by the dilation of a nerve in the roof of your mouth. The nerve center is overreacting to the cold by trying to heat your brain. It is an ice cream headache when you feel those sensations which have turned many smiles to frowns. Passage 6 Some students have poor attendance. The school has tried many ways of addressing this such as teachers have sent letters and/or have talked to parents immediately, school has scheduled parent/ teacher/ guidance counsellor/ school prefect of discipline conferences with students who are habitually absent. Hopefully, this will help more students get to school every day ​</a>

                            12. Do this My name is Maria Angelina Bacarella. I was born on March 7, 1995, in Tawas City, Michigan. My parents are James and Michelle Bacarella, and I have three younger siblings, Sophia, Alex, and Samuel. I attended Holy Family Catholic School in East Tawas from kindergarten until sixth grade. While there I participated in band, choir, Girl Scouts, Council of Catholic Girls, volleyball, softball, and basketball. I was on honor roll and received an academic achievement award. Attending a catholic school helped me to grow academically, in my faith, and as a person, giving me high moral standards. In seventh and eighth grade I attended Tawas Junior High. I was involved in volleyball, basketball, softball, and Club PRIDE. I was on honor roll every semester, and received the presidential academic award. I currently attend Tawas High School. I am involved in losco Pride, Spanish club, liturgical dance, youth group, Student Senate, volleyball, soccer, and National Honor Society. I currently have a 3.88 cumulative G.P.A. and am 8th in my class of 117. Though my school, I go to coop every day for two hours in the 81st District court. While there I have learned many school that pertain to a future career in law. I file papers, type bonds, and observe court. This has given me first-hand experience identifying legal documents and understanding how to proceed in court. I am very motivated to create the best possible future for myself, and have worked very hard to set that up. I have been on the honor roll every marking period thus far in my high school career. I received my academics and athletics varsity letters, an honors pass, the hustle award for volleyball, and an academic achievement award. Some of my strengths include being a hard worker, dedicated, self-motivated, and organized. My weaknesses are that sometimes I am overly ambitious and take on too much at once, and that I tend to expect too much of others. I have volunteered at local nursing homes, and for local churches. My favorite volunteer experience has been helping out with vacation bible school through my church. Through this I am able to help kids grow in their faith. Through losco PRIDE I am able to send a positive message in a fun way. I love these because they allow me to be a positive role model for kids. I currently work at Chick'n Dots Tiny Tots Boutique. My favorite thing about my job is that I get to work with children. I also babysit on the weekends and in the summer. Next year, I plan to attend Michigan State University. I hope to be involved in their college of social sciences, James Madison College to gain my bachelor's degree in International relations. During college I hope to study abroad to assist in my learning other languages. After college I would like to attend Michigan State University College of law. I hope to become an international lawyer someday, working for a company like USAID. With this line of work, I would be able to travel and work on projects to help people in other countries.1.

                            13. EXERCISES 1Directions: Read the article provided for you here. Find out what the article says about obligation, prohibition and permission.What is a strong family? It is a family that sustains, supports and nourishes each member of that family. A strong family unit has to create a safe, positive and supportive place for all members to thrive. Members of a strong family must able to utilize resources and live together in a fairly healthy manner. These are all possible descriptions for a strong family. Moreover, there are important elements that can create a strong family system namely cohesion, flexibility and communication.In a family, cohesion can be defined as the feeling of being loved, of belonging to the group, and of being nurtured. Although closeness within a family is good, there must be a balance between being together and being apart. To bring a family together, there must be commitment and quality bonding time among its members.Besides cohesion, there must be flexibility. or else the family becomes rigid and the authority figures are resented. Families that have a strong spiritual base seem to have a sense of well-being that facilitates working together in times of stress.Fill out the graphic organizer with statements from the article above expressing obligation, prohibition and permission. In case you did not find one for any of the three, just write NONE in the space provided. Use the graph illustration below as your pattern.

                            14. QUARTER 1 MODULE 2 Directions: Read the passages below and determine how each is mainly structured. On a sheet of paper, answer the questions that follow and put the information from each passage in an appropriate graphic organizer. Feel free to make changes of the graphic organizer if necessary. Passage 1 Earthquakes happen all over the world in areas called seismic zones. Seismic zones occur where the plates of crust covering the Earth’s surface meet each other. Inside the Earth, the mantle is always moving, which in turn moves the plates. These plates push against each other, building up tension between them. When the tension between plates becomes too great, they grind against each other, causing the Earth’s surface to tremble and shake. Passage 2 I have noticed that a lot of people are confused about mobile data and Wi-fi. Some people think that they’re the same thing. Both mobile data and Wi-fi allow you to connect to the internet. However, there are some important differences between them. Mobile data is provided by the mobile phone company. Whereas, Wi-fi is comes through cable or phone lines. Mobile data gives you internet access anywhere that your phone can get a signal. But, you can only get Wi-fi access when you are near a router. Customers are usually given a nearly unlimited amount of Wi-fi data, like an all-you-can-eat buffet. On the other hand, mobile data is often sold in limited portions, like an expensive restaurant. It is important to know which you are using so that you aren’t charged additional fees for going over your mobile data plan limits. Passage 3 In the center of Luna’s Spoliarium painting are fallen gladiators being dragged by Roman soldiers. At the left side, spectators ardently await their chance to strip off the combatants of their metal helmets and other armory. In addition, emotions are featured on the left and the right side presents a sober mood. It can be seen also in the right side; an old man carries a torch perhaps searching for his son while a woman weeps the death of her loved one. Passage 4 The first step of changing oil in a car is to gather supplies. After you have collected all of the tools and supplies, prepare your vehicle. Start the car and let it run for one to two minutes to warm the oil and the engine. Then, find a flat surface to jack the vehicle from the center under the engine. Next, locate the oil filter and oil drain plug. Put on work gloves to protect your hands and position an oil drain pan under the engine then remove the plug the rest of the way. Passage 5 What is an ice cream headache? It is when a painful sensation resonates in your head after eating something cold (usually ice cream) on a hot day. This pain is produced by the dilation of a nerve in the roof of your mouth. The nerve center is overreacting to the cold by trying to heat your brain. It is an ice cream headache when you feel those sensations which have turned many smiles to frowns. Passage 6 Some students have poor attendance. The school has tried many ways of addressing this such as teachers have sent letters and/or have talked to parents immediately, school has scheduled parent/ teacher/ guidance counsellor/ school prefect of discipline conferences with students who are habitually absent. Hopefully, this will help more students get to school every day ​</h2><br />
