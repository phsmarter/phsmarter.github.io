Consumers needs are not taken into consideration. Productivity and efficiency are difficult to achieve without profit motive for the workers. It is difficult to achieve internal balances between supply and demand without a price mechanism.</strong>                                                                            Citizen:According to the critics, rule by communist parties has often led to totalitarianism, political repression, restrictions of human rights, poor economic performance, and cultural and artistic censorship.                                                                                Religion:  Religious activities were suppressed in most former communist countries during the totalitarian period, as political elites believed that religion was incompatible with the advancement of communism. Clergy were persecuted, killed and imprisoned and churches were demolished or closed.                                                                                                                           Government/politics;The government owns everything, including property, businesses, and production means. The most significant disadvantage of communism is the fact that it eliminates the free market from domestic society. That means there are no laws of supply and demand available to set the prices for consumers to pay.      </p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        Answer1. Is believing in spiritual beings such as God makes a person religious? Why?<p>Religion is defined as a belief in spiritual and supernatural being/s. So by definition, Yes. But do remember that even Satan believed in the existence of God, yet, Satan is the author of Sin and unrighteousness.</p><strong>Job 1:6, </strong>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them. 2. What are the common characteristics of different religions practiced in different parts of the world?<p>All religion looks up to a divine punishment or reward as judgement for the way a person lived.</p>3. Do you have a religion? In what religious sect do you belong? <p>Yes. If by the world's view, I would be categorized as a Christian. For me, scripture tells us that Faith, belief, and trust in Jesus Christ with repentance of sin is the only way to eternal life.</p><strong>John 14:6,</strong> “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.<p>Not even following any Christian Sect can bring salvation to man, only acknowledgment of Jesus Christ.</p>What advantages have you gain from religion?<p>In scripture, you get the gift of the Holy Spirit</p><strong>John 14:26, </strong>But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.<p>And a renewed personality filled with the Holy Spirit's power</p><strong>Galatians 5:22-23,</strong> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.What disadvantages have you observed or experienced in religion?​<p>Hypocrisy, in scripture, is proclaiming God's words and yet disobeying them. Like False prophets, who use the words of God to deceive people for selfish gains.</p><strong>Colossians 2:23, </strong>These rules may seem wise because they require strong devotion, pious self-denial, and severe bodily discipline. But they provide no help in conquering a person’s evil desires.<p></p><p><strong>An Act of Love - </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/8600372</p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />
