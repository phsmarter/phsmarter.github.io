                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Culture consists of the beliefs, behaviors, objects, and other characteristics common to the members of a particular group or society. Through culture, people and groups define themselves, conform to society's shared values, and contribute to society. Thus, culture includes many societal aspects: language, customs, values, norms, mores, rules, tools, technologies, products, organizations, and institutions. This latter term institution refers to clusters of rules and cultural meanings associated with specific social activities. Common institutions are the family, education, religion, work, and health care.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>According to David Dressier and Donald Cams, “Cultural change is the modification or dis­continuance of existing ‘tried’ and ‘tested ‘procedures transmitted to us from the culture of the past, as well as the introduction of new procedures “.</p><p></p><p>In brief, any change that takes place in the realm of culture can be called cultural change. Culture is not static but dynamic. It also undergoes change. For example, invention and popularisation of the automobile, the addition of new words to our language, changing concepts of property and morality, new forms of music, art or dance, new styles in architecture and sculpture, new rules of grammar or meter, the general trend towards sex equality, etc., all represent cultural changes. Nearly all important changes involve social and cultural, material and non-material aspects.</p><p></p><p>All cultures change, although they do so in different ways and at different rates. Culture is normally regarded as conservative, especially in its non-material aspects.</p><p></p><p>For example, people are reluctant to give up old values, customs and beliefs in favour of new ones. Changes in one area of culture affect in some way or the other, some other parts of culture. This is so because culture is strongly integrated.</p><p></p><p>Further, one change may lead to another. Some of the basic changes, for ex­ample, the ways in which a society earns its living or conducts its economic activity and exploits the environment, can affect almost all the other cultural elements.</p><p></p><p></p><p>hope it helps </p><br />

                            4. write an essay form about economy that related to culture and society ​</h2><br />
                        <p>The economy is an essential aspect of society, and it is closely intertwined with culture. The way people produce, distribute, and consume goods and services can vary significantly depending on cultural norms and values. Culture shapes the economy by influencing the way people view work, trade, and commerce. Moreover, economic changes can also shape culture and social norms.</p><p></p><p>One example of how culture and economy are interconnected is the concept of time. In some cultures, punctuality is highly valued, and time is seen as a precious commodity. In these societies, people are more likely to work efficiently and prioritize productivity, which can lead to economic growth. In contrast, in some other cultures, time is viewed as more fluid, and people may not place as much importance on punctuality. This can lead to a more relaxed work environment but may also result in slower economic growth.</p><p></p><p>Another way culture influences the economy is through consumption patterns. For example, in some cultures, status is highly valued, and people may spend more on luxury goods and services to display their wealth and social standing. This can create demand for high-end products and services, which can drive economic growth in certain industries. In other cultures, frugality may be valued more highly, and people may prioritize saving and investing rather than spending on luxury goods. This can lead to a more stable economy but may limit growth in certain industries.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the economy can also influence cultural norms and values. For example, changes in the job market can lead to shifts in societal attitudes towards work and career. As industries change, new types of jobs may emerge, and people may need to adapt their skills and career paths to remain competitive. This can lead to changes in the way people view work, education, and career goals. Similarly, economic growth can also influence cultural norms around consumption, leisure, and entertainment.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the economy is deeply intertwined with culture and society. Cultural norms and values influence economic behavior, and economic changes can also shape cultural norms and values. Understanding the relationship between economy, culture, and society is essential for policymakers and business leaders to make informed decisions that promote economic growth and social well-being. Moreover, recognizing the importance of culture in economic development can help to create more inclusive and sustainable economic systems that benefit everyone in society.</p><p></p><br />

Why is it important to understand culture society and politics?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>-because culture influences development from the moment we're born, making an impact on us as we grow. For instance, culture can affect how children build values, language, belief systems, and an understanding of themselves as individuals and as members of society.</p><p>-because cultural heritage is central to protecting our sense of who we are. It gives us an irrefutable connection to the past – to certain social values, beliefs, customs and traditions, that allows us to identify ourselves with others and deepen our sense of unity, belonging and national pride.</p><p>- because culture plays an essential role in the life of a person and society. It acts as a means of accumulation, storage, and transmission of human experience. It is the culture that shapes people into who they are as they gain knowledge, learn the language, symbols, values, norms, customs, and traditions</p><p>-because knowing how society works as a whole and as part of our life helps us find a better way to improve it or keep it alive. The well-being of the country can also be seen in society.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>       It is possible to call any transition that takes place in the realm of culture a cultural change. Culture is dynamic rather than static. </strong>It is also subject to change. Inventing and popularizing the car, introducing new terms to our vocabulary, evolving conceptions of property and morality, new types of music, art or dance, new styles of architecture and sculpture, new grammar or meter laws, the general movement towards gender equality, etc. are all cultural changes.

In many cases, cultural and societal norms perpetuate poverty by creating barriers to access and opportunities. This essay will examine the ways in which culture and society contribute to poverty and what can be done to address these issues.</p><p></p><p>Culture plays a significant role in shaping attitudes and behaviors towards poverty. In some cultures, poverty is seen as a personal failing and a result of laziness or lack of effort. This perspective can lead to stigmatization of those living in poverty and create a cycle of shame and isolation. On the other hand, some cultures view poverty as a structural issue and believe that everyone has a responsibility to support those in need. These cultural differences can impact policy decisions and shape the way in which poverty is addressed.</p><p></p><p>Society also plays a role in perpetuating poverty. In many cases, societal systems and structures create barriers to access and opportunities for those living in poverty. For example, inadequate education and job training programs can limit the ability of individuals to find stable employment and improve their economic status. Additionally, discriminatory practices in housing, healthcare, and the justice system can further marginalize those living in poverty.</p><p></p><p>In order to address poverty, it is important to examine the ways in which culture and society contribute to the issue. One approach is to shift cultural attitudes towards poverty by promoting empathy and understanding. This can be achieved through education campaigns and public messaging that challenges negative stereotypes and promotes a culture of compassion.</p><p></p><p>On a societal level, policies and programs must be put in place to remove barriers to access and opportunities for those living in poverty. This can include investing in education and job training programs, providing affordable housing and healthcare, and reforming discriminatory practices within the justice system.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, poverty is a complex issue that is shaped by cultural and societal factors. It is important to address these underlying causes in order to create lasting change and improve the lives of those living in poverty. By promoting a culture of empathy and implementing policies that remove barriers to access and opportunities, we can work towards a more equitable and just society for all.</p><br />

                            19. write an essay form about technology that related to culture and society​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Technology has become an inseparable part of our modern society and has greatly influenced our cultural norms and practices. The impact of technology on culture and society is multidimensional, ranging from communication to social interactions and even to our daily routines. This essay aims to explore the various ways in which technology has influenced culture and society, and the implications of these changes.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant impacts of technology on culture and society is the transformation of the way we communicate. With the advent of smartphones, social media, and instant messaging apps, communication has become easier, faster, and more accessible than ever before. This has led to the emergence of new forms of communication, such as emojis and abbreviations, that have become part of our cultural vocabulary. These changes have also influenced the way we interact with each other, leading to new social norms and etiquettes that are unique to the digital world.</p><p></p><p>Technology has also transformed the way we consume and create media. The rise of streaming services such as Netflix and YouTube has led to a democratization of media consumption, allowing anyone with an internet connection to access an almost infinite amount of content. This has led to the emergence of new cultural trends and movements, such as YouTube celebrities and online fandoms, that have a significant influence on society. At the same time, technology has also made it easier for individuals to create and distribute their own media, leading to the rise of user-generated content and the democratization of creativity.</p><p></p><p>Another significant impact of technology on culture and society is the transformation of our daily routines. The rise of automation and artificial intelligence has led to significant changes in the workplace, making some jobs obsolete while creating new ones. This has led to significant social and economic changes, such as the rise of the gig economy and the increasing importance of digital skills. At the same time, technology has also transformed the way we shop, cook, and even exercise, leading to new cultural practices and norms.</p><p></p><p>While technology has brought about many positive changes, it has also raised concerns about its impact on culture and society. One of the most significant concerns is the rise of digital addiction and its impact on mental health. The constant need to be connected and the pressure to present a curated online persona has led to an increase in anxiety and depression, particularly among young people. There are also concerns about the impact of technology on privacy and data security, as well as the potential for technology to exacerbate existing social inequalities.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, technology has had a profound impact on culture and society, transforming the way we communicate, consume media, and live our daily lives. While these changes have brought about many positive developments, they have also raised concerns about the impact of technology on mental health, privacy, and social inequality. It is important for us to be aware of these changes and their implications, and to take steps to ensure that technology is used in a responsible and ethical manner that benefits society as a whole.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>THE CULTURE AND SOCIETY </p><p></p><p>Culture is the common denominator that makes the actions of the individuals understandable to a particular group. That is, the system of shared values, beliefs, behaviors, and artifacts making up a society’s way of life. Culture can either be represented in a material or non-material form. The definitions and specific traits of each of them are discussed below.</p><p></p><p>Material culture is a term related to the physical creations made, used, or shared by the members of a certain society. It is society’s buffer against the environment. The components of material culture are all the creations (objects) of the humankind and mind, for example, cars, faucets, computers, trees, and minerals, just to mention but a few.</p><p></p><p>The transformation of raw material into usable forms through the employment of knowledge is paramount in the achievement of material culture. For example, we make living abodes to shelter ourselves from the adversities of weather and for our own privacy at the basic level. Beyond this, we make, use, and share sophisticated, interesting, and essential items relaying our cultural orientation. For instance, the types of clothes one wears reflect so much into the culture we subscribe to, like school, religion, or where the last vacation was spent.</p><p></p><p>Non-material culture, on the other hand, is the abstract or unseen creations done by society and fashioned towards the behavioral influence of it. The components of the non-material culture include symbols, languages, values, and norms. For instance, the activities that society takes part in include things like cricket in India, social institutions, such as churches, schools, family, and so forth.</p><p></p><p>The use of language, the patterns of behavior, beliefs, and values shape the direction of a society over time. Language plays a crucial part when it comes to influence or perception, values guide and teach us what society should be like, while the existing norms form the customs of society.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cultural Change in Our Society – According to Kingsley Davis, the cultural change “embraces all changes occurring in any branch of culture including art, science, technology, philosophy, etc., as well as changes in the forms and rules of social organisation”.</p><p></p><p></p><p>According to David Dressier and Donald Cams, “Cultural change is the modification or dis­continuance of existing ‘tried’ and ‘tested ‘procedures transmitted to us from the culture of the past, as well as the introduction of new procedures “.</p><p></p><p>In brief, any change that takes place in the realm of culture can be called cultural change.

<p>
</p>All cultures change, but in different ways and at different rates. Culture is typically thought to be conservative, especially in its non-material facets.

People, for example, are unable to abandon old traditions, practices, and beliefs in favor of new ones. Changes in one field of culture have an effect on other areas of culture in any way. This is due to the fact that culture is profoundly integrated.
Furthermore, one improvement can lead to another. Any fundamental changes, such as how a society makes its livelihood, performs its economic function, and exploits the atmosphere, may have an effect on almost all other cultural elements.
<p><strong>Culture and Society</strong>
</p>Culture distinguishes one community or society from another; different societies have different cultures.
Beyond biology, culture contains human components such as our standards and ideals, the tales we tell, taught or developed habits, religious convictions, art and fashion, and so on. Culture is what distinguishes one community or society from the other.  Different societies have different cultures; however, it is important not to confuse the concept of culture with the concept of community. A community is a group's beliefs and practices, while society is the individuals who share those beliefs and practices. Without the other, neither society nor culture will survive.
<p>
</p>Sociologists define society as a group of people that communicate in such a way that they share a community. The cultural bond could be ethnic or racial, gender-related, or based on common interests, traditions, and practices. The word society may also be used in a geographical sense to refer to people who share a similar culture in a certain region. People living in arctic climates, for example, formed communities that varied from those living in desert climates. Over time, a vast spectrum of human civilizations emerged all over the world.
A culture is made up of the "objects" of a society, while a society is made up of individuals who share a similar culture. When the words community and civilization first took on their present definitions, the bulk of the world's population employed and lived in small communities in the same place. In today's world of 6 billion people, these words have lost some of their utility as more people connect and exchange capital on a global scale. People prefer to use history and society in more traditional ways.<p></p><p>
