                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. "Invictus" by William Ernest Henley</p><p>"Invictus" challenges the thinking that we don’t have any say in what happens to us in life. The lines, especially at the end, challenge us to take charge of our lives, make good decisions, and then own the decisions we make.</p><p></p><p>2. "Who Killed the Plan?" by Amos Russel Wells</p><p>We are always making plans, pushing forward, and striving to accomplish what we can. This poem talks about the things that could kill those plans and decisions. The consequences of laziness, procrastination, pride, and a lack of follow-through will always kill plans. Putting something in motion requires determination, endurance, and grit.</p><p></p><p>3. "The Door" by Jessie Belle Rittenhouse</p><p>Doors open for us all the time. If we ignore them, decide to go a different way, or try closed doors, it might not work out for us. This poem encourages us to walk through open doors rather than waiting too long to make a decision.</p><p></p><p>4. "Perseverance" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</p><p>"Perseverance," a poem about what it takes to make our dreams, goals, and ambitions come true in life, also details how you can't achieve greatness without first putting in the long hours and hard work. With hard work comes great reward.</p><p></p><p>5. "The Lesson" by Paul Laurence Dunbar</p><p>Life may throw us hardballs, disappointments, and discouragements, but we have the choice to take those things and learn from them. We also can use our sorrows to help other people going through difficult times and seasons.</p><p></p><p>Poems About Making Hard Choices</p><p>Life introduces all sorts of hard choices and poets often reflect on a learning experience they had when making hard choices. Some sad poems would make excellent funeral poems for a deceased loved one well-versed in the art of making hard choices.</p><p></p><p>6. "My Treasure" by Arthur Weir</p><p>One of the biggest decisions we have to make in life involves our chief ambitions. Will we search for fame? Love? Something else? In this poem, those who come across the author's path get asked, “What do you gather?” After each person shares what they gather, the author concludes that all we need to do is make the hard choices in life so we can have a life we want to build.</p><p></p><p>» MORE: Easy as 1-2-3, make an online will in minutes.</p><p> </p><p></p><p>7. "His Other Chance" by Edgar A. Guest</p><p>Sometimes we find ourselves knocked down by the consequences of our poor choices. As this author encourages, we then face the hardest choice of all — the choice to rise again, fix our mistakes, and make new decisions that will turn our life around.</p><p></p><p>8. "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost</p><p>When making decisions, we often face at least two distinct paths. By choosing one path, we eliminate the others. However, choosing the path to take amounts to a difficult decision. Frost encourages his readers to take the road less traveled rather than going down the easier path.</p><p></p><p>9. "The Hustling Pumpkin Vine" by Uncle Mose</p><p>Whether in elementary school, college, or the workplace, we have to make the hard choice to plow through difficult tasks, work on hard assignments, and get along with people that we may not click with. However, if you choose to keep pressing on, you’ll find that you conquer all the obstacles in your way and make your dreams come true.</p><p></p><p>10. "Keep A-Pluggin’ Away" by Paul Laurence Dunbar</p><p>Sometimes the hardest choice also involves the opportunity to “keep a-plugging away.” When everything seems particularly hard, we often feel like giving up. However, Paul Dunbar encourages his readers to make the hard choice to keep going on, climbing up, and pushing forward.</p><p></p><p>Poems About Making the Wrong Choices</p><p>It happens to all of us — we try our best but sometimes we still make the wrong choices. Those choices have consequences and we have to live with them. These poems speak about this phenomenon and provide encouragement. Some of these might even help you comfort a loved one in emotional pain.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pili kanalang</p><br />

Robert Frost wrote “The Road Not Taken” as a joke for a friend, the poet Edward Thomas.

</p><p>1. What is the moral conveyed in the poem? Is it explicit or implicit? Explain.
</p><p>It is implicit because the poem did deliver the message well, but not plainly.
</p><p>2. What does the poem say about human nature when it comes to decision-making?
</p><p>"The Road Not Taken" is an ambiguous poem that allows the reader to think about choices in life, whether to go with the mainstream or go it alone. If life is a journey, this poem highlights those times in life when a decision has to be made.
</p><p>3. How does this poem remind you of the personal choices that you made before?
</p><p>It reminds me of the times when I chose a path that other people chooses less.
</p><p>4. In your point of view, do you think the speaker in the poem is happy about his choice? Why or why not?
</p><p>Yes. The poet(Robert Frost) seems to be happy by deciding the road because he feels that he want to be unique and moreover he just compares the two roads with life. When we choose the difficult option rather than going on a short route. We work hard to reach the destination and be happy at last.
</p><p>5. What are the chances that the speaker will get to come back and try the other path?
</p><p>To be honest, none, because we can’t turn back the time that’s why we have to put much thought into the choices that we make.
