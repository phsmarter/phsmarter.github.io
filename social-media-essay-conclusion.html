It is a cultural trait that reflects the laid-back nature of Filipinos and their tendency to prioritize personal relationships and social interactions over punctuality. However, this attitude towards time has its drawbacks and can have a negative impact on society. This essay aims to shed light on Filipino Time, its origins, and its effects on Filipino culture and society.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>Filipino Time is deeply rooted in the country's history and culture. During the Spanish colonization, Filipinos were subjected to strict schedules and routines imposed by the colonial authorities. This led to a rebellion against the enforcement of time, which eventually manifested into the cultural norm of being late. Today, Filipino Time is seen as a reflection of the country's laid-back and relaxed lifestyle. However, this cultural trait has a negative impact on the country's productivity and efficiency. Being late can cause delays and inconvenience, and it can become a hindrance to the growth and development of the country.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Filipino Time can also have a negative impact on personal relationships. Being late can cause frustration and disappointment, especially in professional and social settings. It can also be interpreted as a sign of disrespect and lack of consideration for other people's time. In contrast, being punctual shows respect, responsibility, and professionalism. It can build trust and strengthen relationships.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, Filipino Time is a cultural trait deeply ingrained in Filipino society. While it reflects the country's laid-back and relaxed lifestyle, it can also have negative consequences on productivity, efficiency, and personal relationships. Therefore, it is important for Filipinos to be aware of the impact of being late and to strive towards punctuality and professionalism. By doing so, Filipinos can contribute to the growth and development of the country and build stronger personal relationships.</p><br />

                        I’ll answer the first topic which is “Should school be taught online instead of in a classroom?”<br /><br />To answer that question in my personal opinion, no.<br /><br />You see, there are a lot of benefits regarding studying at school more than online. You see your friends more, and interact socially with people, and you absorb more knowledge that way since a teacher is teaching you. Not self taught or whatever. You can also go to different rooms whenever you have different classes which I think kind of contributes to getting fit. There’s really countless reasons on why Offline Classes &gt; Online Classes<br /><br /><br />This is my personal opinion, hope it helps.
