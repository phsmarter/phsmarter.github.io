                            3. Speech about career as a future teacher?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>to respected principals,teachers and to my fellow students,good day ! Teachers hold a very special place in the lives of students. They play a very important role in shaping a nation’s future by guiding their students in becoming ideal citizens. it’s an opportunity for me to share few words about teachers, their role in schools and colleges and their influence on the students.</p><p>Teachers are the backbone of our society because they majorly contribute in shaping the future of a nation, i.e. students and guide them in becoming an ideal citizen of the country. Teacher’s job is full of responsibility and challenges because not every student is same and thus the teacher has to be dynamic and adopt different teaching patterns for different students. Teaching is a social practice and more than knowledge, a teacher must be a good human being who can very well shoulder the responsibility of his/her job and understand the sensitivity of the situation where students from different backgrounds have come together for learning and thus apply skills and knowledge to the best of his/her capacity while teaching.
</p><p>Some of the qualities which every teacher must possess in order to become most acceptable are:
</p><p>Enthusiasm – It is a known fact that teachers who show enthusiasm while teaching create a positive atmosphere and learning environment which help students in gaining knowledge fast and with fun. These teachers don’t follow the uniform pattern instead, they innovate teaching methods to keep the students engaged and enthusiastic.
</p><p>The most important role a teacher plays is in motivating the students; some of the students find their teacher to be a role model and try to imitate them. Thus it is very important that the teacher leaves a positive impression on each student.
</p><p>Interaction with learners – It is very important for the teacher to indulge into transparent and open discussion with the students in order to understand the capability of the learner. Some students are shy, while other may be afraid of failure. A teacher is highly trusted to build up the student emotionally and practically.
</p><p>Conventionally, teaching is considered equivalent to praying. In olden days, parents used to leave their children in gurukul (a kind of residential school where students live with the teacher for studies). This tradition was greatly supported by the trust and bond between the parents and teachers. Even today, trust is one of the most important factors which motivate parents to get their children admitted in a particular school. A teacher is considered to be the alternate parents; this makes teaching all the more challenging and full of accountability.
</p><p>In recent days, we get to hear a lot about corporal punishment. Some of the teachers get barbaric and beat students so badly that some of them don’t even survive. This is highly restricted in all over India. Though it is important for the teachers to be strict sometimes but there can be alternate methods to punish the students than harming them physically.
</p><p>Well, I would like to end this note with a huge thanks to our teachers who are so caring and compassionate. We are highly honoured to be a part of this School.
</p><p>Thank You!</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Veterinary medicine, also known as vet med, is the branch of medicine that focuses on the health and well-being of animals. As an animal lover, I have always been interested in pursuing a career in vet med, and hope to one day become a veterinarian.</p><p></p><p>To become a veterinarian, one must complete a rigorous academic and practical training program. This typically involves obtaining a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree from an accredited college or university, which can take between four to six years to complete. During this time, students learn about animal anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, and diseases, as well as how to diagnose and treat a variety of animal ailments.</p><p></p><p>In addition to academic coursework, students must also gain hands-on experience working with animals. This can be achieved through internships, externships, or other practical training programs. Many veterinary schools also require students to complete a certain number of clinical hours, where they work under the supervision of licensed veterinarians in a variety of settings.</p><p></p><p>Once a student completes their DVM degree and passes the licensing exam in their state, they can begin practicing as a veterinarian. Veterinarians can work in a variety of settings, such as private clinics, animal hospitals, research facilities, zoos, and wildlife preserves. They may specialize in a particular area of vet med, such as small animal care, equine care, exotic animal care, or research.</p><p></p><p>One of the most rewarding aspects of a career in vet med is the opportunity to improve the lives of animals. Veterinarians play a crucial role in ensuring the health and well-being of animals, from routine check-ups and preventative care to emergency surgeries and advanced treatments for complex diseases. They also work closely with pet owners and animal caregivers to provide education and support, helping to strengthen the bond between humans and animals.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, a career in vet med is a challenging and rewarding path for those who have a passion for animals and a desire to make a positive impact on the world. While it requires a significant investment of time, effort, and resources to become a licensed veterinarian, the rewards of working with animals and improving their health and well-being make it a highly fulfilling and satisfying career choice.</p><br />

                            8. speech about career as a future CALLCENTER?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My goal is to convince you that call centers have a bright future, and I'm going to do it with a few reasons. This is going to be a really short talk, and I think I can do it in an hour.</p><p>The first thing I'm going to do is ask the audience to think about the question "What if?" I think it's important to ask this question, because it helps me get into the listener's mind. What if you had one year, and the call center was gone? How would you do it? I want to know what you think would happen. I want to find out where you think our industry is going. The truth is, it's hard to tell. It's really hard to predict the future of anything. The reason is that we humans are really bad at it. We tend to be really biased, and we look at the same situation, and we are not like a call center in which all of us have different goals. I want you to pretend that call center that you use was the only call center in the country. And the world was like what it is today. But what would it look like a year from now? What would it look like? Would you still have your job? What would it be like?</p><p>Now, the problem with this is that this is really hard to do. The truth is, call centers are going to be around forever. It's a really good business model. Every company has to have a contact center. Every person has to have a phone. Call centers are going to be part of life. I think there are some good signs, as long as you understand how to be part of the future. If you are, if you understand what your job needs to be to be part of the future, you will be fine. You won't have to stay in the call center forever.</p><p>Now, there are so many reasons. I know that there is so much competition for the jobs right now, but there were so many jobs before. Why was that? Let's think about it. Think about why the call center has been around so long. Why did it work? I think that the reason that the call center worked so well, is that it was the easiest way for people to get in touch with people. People were so used to them. Companies were so used to them that they thought it was fine. They thought that it was the cheapest way to do it. Now, the problem is, call centers are a really bad idea. We don't really need them.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Yan lang makakaya ko </p><br />

Using the Holland's career development theory, I have discovered that I have a social personality type. This means that I enjoy working with people and helping them to solve problems. I also value social relationships and prefer jobs that involve interpersonal communication and collaboration. This has helped me to narrow down my career options and focus on jobs that align with my personality type.</p><p></p><p>Another thing I have learned about myself is my strengths and areas of development. Through the use of self-assessment tools such as SWOT analysis and skills inventory, I have been able to identify my strengths such as problem-solving, communication, and leadership skills. I have also identified areas that need improvement such as time management and networking skills. This has helped me to develop a plan to enhance my skills and address my development needs.</p><p></p><p>My Intended Career Goals</p><p></p><p>My intended career goal is to become a social worker. The inspiration for this career choice comes from my passion for helping people, particularly those who are vulnerable and marginalized in society. I believe that as a social worker, I can make a positive impact on people's lives by providing support, advocacy, and empowerment. I have also been inspired by the stories of social workers who have made a difference in their communities and have helped to bring about social change.</p><p></p><p>What I Need to Do to Achieve My Career Goals</p><p></p><p>To achieve my career goals, I need to acquire the necessary experience, skills, attributes, and qualifications. One of the things I need to do is to gain practical experience through internships and volunteering opportunities. This will provide me with an opportunity to apply my theoretical knowledge and develop my skills in a real-world setting. I also need to develop my communication, networking, and time management skills to be an effective social worker.</p><p></p><p>In terms of qualifications, I need to complete a degree in social work and obtain a license to practice as a social worker. I also need to continue my professional development by attending workshops, seminars, and training programs to enhance my knowledge and skills. Additionally, I need to develop personal attributes such as empathy, compassion, and resilience to be able to work effectively with clients and manage the emotional demands of the job.</p><p></p><p>My Current Skills</p><p></p><p>Currently, I possess a range of skills that are relevant to my intended career as a social worker. I have strong communication skills, both verbal and written, which will be essential in working with clients, colleagues, and stakeholders. I also have good problem-solving skills, which will enable me to identify and address the needs of my clients. Additionally, I have leadership skills, which will be useful in managing teams and advocating for social change.</p><p></p><p>My PDP</p><p></p><p>My personal development plan (PDP) involves a range of activities that will help me to achieve my career goals. These include gaining practical experience through internships and volunteering, attending workshops and training programs, and developing personal attributes such as empathy and resilience. I also plan to improve my networking skills by attending networking events and building relationships with professionals in the field. Additionally, I plan to continue my education by pursuing a master's degree in social work to enhance my knowledge and skills.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the Career Planning for Social Science unit has been a valuable learning experience for me. Through the use of career development theory, I have gained a deeper understanding of myself and my intended career goals. I have also developed a plan to achieve my career goals by acquiring the necessary experience, skills, attributes, and qualifications. I am confident that with the skills and knowledge I have gained in this unit, I will be able to make a positive impact on people's lives as a social worker.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

As I began my career planning in High school the realization of how long it would take to become a doctor discouraged me. I once again changed my career goals to becoming a teacher, and then finally to a nurse who could assist with the delivery of babies. Making the right choice was important to me and that explains the ever changing career decisions. After doing some research I decided that a nurse midwife was along the lines of where I want to be.
