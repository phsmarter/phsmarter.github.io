                                            Instructions: Read the example of an argumentative essay below.  
Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</a>

                            8. Instructions: Read the example of an argumentative essay below.  
Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

                            18. pls read the essay before you answer.. and highlight this essay, then explain the level of accuracy of the highlighted information you just did.Have you ever listened about global warming? Global warming is becoming a more serious problem and has become a threat to our planet. So I will tell you how we can stop global warming.Global warming is making our world a dangerous place and it is destroying the world. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse gases that are left by factories, cars, motorbikes etc. The air is polluted from factory emissions and car exhaust. Because of the greenhouse gases there is acid rain. Acid rain destroys lakes and rivers and affects the fish and wildlife. Due to global warming the ozone layer is depleting and the harmful ultraviolet rays are reaching the earth. This causes the glaciers and icebergs to melt.First, we have work together to reduce, reuse and recycle to stop the causes of global warming. One of the things we could do is recycle more. Recycling is the process in which we could reuse things like cardboard, plastic bottles and plastic bags. For example we could use both sides of a piece of paper. Even more useful, would be to buy washable water bottles that can be reused. Finally we can buy goods with less packaging and we could carry cloth bags to carry our groceries and purchases instead of wasting plastic bags.Next we need to find more different types of energy to use as another step to stop the effects of global warming. Using more solar, wind and hydroelectric power would reduce pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. Less gas and coal would be burned if people used alternate power sources. As well we can use public transport instead of driving alone in individual cars. If people prefer not to take the bus or train they could walk or ride a bike. There are other ways to put global warming in check. One is to plant more trees and stop deforesting. More trees produce more oxygen which benefits the ozone layer. Another way is to switch off electrical equipment when not in use would stop the wastage of precious electricity.When people think about the concequences and how to help to prevent global warming and take action we could stop global warming. This would make our world a wonderful place to live.questions:1.how did you validate the accuracy and credibility of the highlighted information?2.why is it important to ensure and confirm the accuracy and credibility of the information that you just red?ps:answer it im just doing this for fun​</h2><br />

Do you agree or disagree? Use facts, statistics, and studies to supplement your views.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a world where globalization has become the norm, the ability to understand and speak a foreign language has become increasingly important. I strongly agree that learning a foreign language is critical for several reasons. Firstly, it allows individuals to communicate with individuals from different parts of the world. Secondly, it can help improve cognitive abilities as individuals who speak multiple languages have been found to perform better in tasks such as problem-solving, creativity, and multitasking. Finally, it can open up new career opportunities and make individuals more marketable in today's job market.</p><p></p><p>Learning a foreign language can help individuals communicate and connect with people from different cultures. As travel becomes more accessible, individuals are finding themselves needing to speak foreign languages to communicate with hotel staff, tour guides, and local residents. For example, individuals who speak Chinese Mandarin can easily interact with individuals living in China, as well as Chinese-speaking individuals in other countries. This can lead to a better and more positive experience for both parties, which can foster deeper connections and stronger relationships.</p><p></p><p>Studies have also shown that individuals who speak multiple languages display better cognitive abilities compared to those who speak only one language. Bilingual individuals have been found to perform better in tasks that require problem-solving and creative thinking. This is because of the cognitive benefits of learning a foreign language. Learning a new language requires individuals to develop better memory, concentration, and multitasking skills, which can help them become more effective in other areas of their lives.</p><p></p><p>Learning a foreign language provides individuals with new career opportunities, making them more marketable in today's job market. With globalization, many multinational companies require their employees to speak at least two languages to communicate with clients, suppliers, and shareholders. This means that individuals who speak a foreign language have a better chance of obtaining a higher salary, job promotions, and new job opportunities. Additionally, learning a foreign language can help individuals interact and network with people from different regions and cultures, further expanding their employment opportunities.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, learning a foreign language is essential in today's globalized world. It provides individuals with the ability to communicate with people from different parts of the world, improves cognitive abilities, and increases career opportunities. With statistics and studies supporting the benefits of learning a foreign language, it's clear that individuals should make every effort to learn a second language.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) answer. </p><p>As a student, I believe that homework is essential to promoting learning, and I do not support the idea of reducing or eliminating it. While I understand the concerns of some parents who feel that their children are being overloaded with homework, I believe that homework has numerous benefits that cannot be ignored.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>As a student, I believe that homework is essential to promoting learning, and I do not support the idea of reducing or eliminating it. While I understand the concerns of some parents who feel that their children are being overloaded with homework, I believe that homework has numerous benefits that cannot be ignored.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, homework promotes independent learning and time management skills. When students are given homework, they are required to complete it on their own, without the immediate support of a teacher. This allows them to develop their own learning strategies and work at their own pace, which is a valuable skill that they will need in higher education and beyond. Furthermore, homework helps students to develop time management skills, as they must learn to balance the demands of school work with other activities and responsibilities.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, homework provides an opportunity for students to practice and reinforce what they have learned in class. In subjects like mathematics, science, and foreign languages, students need to practice regularly to master the concepts and skills. Homework assignments allow students to apply what they have learned in class to real-world situations, which helps to reinforce the learning and deepen their understanding of the subject matter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, homework provides teachers with a means of assessing student learning and progress. By assigning homework, teachers can evaluate the level of understanding and mastery of the subject matter, and adjust their instruction accordingly. Homework also provides a basis for feedback and evaluation, which is essential for improving student performance.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Global warming is a word that practically everyone has heard of. However, the majority of us are still unsure of what it means. As a result, global warming refers to a steady increase in the overall temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. There are a variety of things going on that are steadily raising the temperature. Our ice glaciers are fast disappearing due to global warming. </p><p></p><p>Global warming has evolved into a serious issue that requires our full attention. It is occurring due to a combination of factors rather than a single cause. These factors are both natural and man-made. The emission of greenhouse gases that are unable to escape from the planet, causing the temperature to rise, is one of the natural causes. Further, volcanic eruptions are also responsible for global warming. That is to say, these eruptions release tons of carbon dioxide which contributes to global warming. Similarly, methane is also one big issue responsible for global warming.</p><p></p><p>Global warming can be stopped when combined efforts are put in. For that, individuals and governments, both have to take steps towards achieving it. We must begin with the reduction of greenhouse gas, they need to monitor the consumption of gasoline. Switch to a hybrid car and reduce the release of carbon dioxide. </p><p></p><p>All of us must realize the fact that our earth is not well. It needs to treatment and we can help it heal. The present generation must take up the responsibility of stopping global warming in order to prevent the suffering of future generations. </p><br />
