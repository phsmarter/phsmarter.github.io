Thank you. Abortion  Abortion is an act which intends to bring about the death of a fetus for the sake of the woman who carries it. The main argument against abortion is based on the right to life. Abortion is considered as plain murder of an innocent being; and for that it is deserves the gravest condemnation. Because of the unborn status of the subject of abortion, the controversy usually revolves around the debate whether the subject in the womb is already a person, or not; or to put it in another perspective, whether the subject inside the woman has life already, or not. Most pro-abortion arguments will argue for the acceptability of abortion because they do not recognize the fetus, or the embryo as constituting a human person who deserves the right to life. The basic argument thus runs: Every person has a right to life. The fetus is not yet a person. Therefore, the fetus does not have yet the right to life. An analogy may perhaps simplify this. A presidential candidate is a potential president; but she does not deserve the rights and privileges of an actual president until she wins the election. Similarly, a fetus who is a potential person, does not possess the right to life because it is not yet a person.  We have to see the important aspect of this pro-abortion argument-that is, killing a person is wrong. They only argue for the permissibility of abortion because they do not consider fetuses or embryos as persons. That is why most of the arguments are directed to the issue of determining when life is produced. As for the Vatican, abortion is a termination of life, and it is therefore wrong. The right to life must not be discriminating. The Vatican declares: "The right to life is no less to be respected in the small infant just born than in the mature person." In reality, respect for human life is called for from the time that the process of generation begins.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Adolescence is a crucial period of development that presents many challenges and demands. It is a time when individuals are transitioning from childhood to adulthood, which can bring about physical, emotional, and psychological changes. Therefore, understanding and meeting the challenges and demands of adolescence is essential for healthy development and successful transition into adulthood. Some of these challenges include navigating changes in the body, developing a sense of identity, establishing healthy relationships, making decisions about education and career paths, and dealing with peer pressure and societal expectations.</p><p>2. I can say that some challenges that adolescents commonly face include managing emotions, coping with stress, establishing independence while still relying on caregivers, dealing with social media and technology use, and navigating romantic relationships. These challenges can be particularly difficult for adolescents who lack support from family and peers or who have experienced trauma or adverse experiences in their childhood.</p><p>3. The most significant person in one's life at present may vary depending on their individual circumstances and needs. It could be a parent, a friend, a mentor, a significant other, or someone else who provides support, guidance, and understanding. The importance of this person may also change over time as one's needs and circumstances evolve. Ultimately, having a significant person in one's life who provides  and social support can be crucial for navigating the challenges and demands of adolescence and beyond.</p><br />

                            23. MOVIE: ENCANTO
Introduction:
1. Give a little background about the movie.
2. How is it different from the other Disney movies that you have watched?
Body:
1. Choose one movie character who reflects your personality the most.
2. Describe the movie character with her "gift", personal appearance, and attitude. Explain how you two are somehow similar and why chose that character.
Conclusion:
1. If you would change one thing in the movie, what would it be and why?
2. What important message and life lessons are conveyed in the movie?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The movie about a family with different magic/Gift (or should I say Encanto). But one member, Mirabel, didn't get any gift. And this frightened and disappointed their Abuela. So to make up for it Mirabel had always tried to help the family in her own way. But it became the reason for their family to break. Her Uncle Bruno leaving, Mirabel and her sister Isabela not working out, and more family misunderstanding. But as we go on the story the family starts to mend and tries to understand each other.Encanto if more of a interpersonal family story. The relationships, traditions, and beliefs are quite similar to people, thus they understand and relate more to the story.<p>Body:</p>Luisa She strong, beautiful and smart character. I believe she is the one I relate to the most. She is not confident about herself, is scared to not have a purpose and for others to see her as nothing once she tries to give for herself. I do feel this myself, especially now in my current situation where I feel vulnerable because I cant help anyone since I am only at home.<p>Conclusion:</p>The movie is great as it is. But if there is one change I could make that is for the family Madrigal to have always understood and and cared and have not down each other.The lessons I have picked in the movie is that everyone is equally special as the other despite who and what they have done. We are all special in our own ways. And to not let this differences be the reason for one to have misunderstandings. That we are all to be loved not because of what we can do but because of who we are.<br />

Abortion  Abortion is an act which intends to bring about the death of a fetus for the sake of the woman who carries it. The main argument against abortion is based on the right to life. Abortion is considered as plain murder of an innocent being; and for that it is deserves the gravest condemnation. Because of the unborn status of the subject of abortion, the controversy usually revolves around the debate whether the subject in the womb is already a person, or not; or to put it in another perspective, whether the subject inside the woman has life already, or not. Most pro-abortion arguments will argue for the acceptability of abortion because they do not recognize the fetus, or the embryo as constituting a human person who deserves the right to life. The basic argument thus runs: Every person has a right to life. The fetus is not yet a person. Therefore, the fetus does not have yet the right to life. An analogy may perhaps simplify this. A presidential candidate is a potential president; but she does not deserve the rights and privileges of an actual president until she wins the election. Similarly, a fetus who is a potential person, does not possess the right to life because it is not yet a person.  We have to see the important aspect of this pro-abortion argument-that is, killing a person is wrong. They only argue for the permissibility of abortion because they do not consider fetuses or embryos as persons. That is why most of the arguments are directed to the issue of determining when life is produced. As for the Vatican, abortion is a termination of life, and it is therefore wrong. The right to life must not be discriminating. The Vatican declares: "The right to life is no less to be respected in the small infant just born than in the mature person." In reality, respect for human life is called for from the time that the process of generation begins.​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>The essay is about the debate surrounding abortion, with the main argument against it being based on the right to life. The controversy centers on the question of whether a fetus is considered a human person with the right to life or not. Pro-abortion arguments argue that fetuses or embryos do not possess the right to life because they are not yet considered persons. On the other hand, the Vatican considers abortion as a termination of life and therefore wrong, as it is a violation of the right to life which must be respected for all humans from the moment of conception. The essay concludes by emphasizing the importance of respect for human life from the beginning of the process of generation.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Harvard, Favorite fictional character</p><p>Of all the characters that I've "met" through books and movies, two stand out as people that I most want to emulate. They are Attacus Finch from To Kill A Mockingbird and Dr. Archibald "Moonlight" Graham from Field of Dreams. They appeal to me because they embody what I strive to be. They are influential people in small towns who have a direct positive effect on those around them. I, too, plan to live in a small town after graduating from college, and that positive effect is something I must give in order to be satisfied with my life.</p><p>Both Mr. Finch and Dr. Graham are strong supporting characters in wonderful stories. They symbolize good, honesty, and wisdom. When the story of my town is written I want to symbolize those things. The base has been formed for me to live a productive, helpful life. As an Eagle Scout I represent those things that Mr. Finch and Dr. Graham represent. In the child/adolescent world I am Mr. Finch and Dr. Graham, but soon I'll be entering the adult world, a world in which I'm not yet prepared to lead.</p><p>I'm quite sure that as teenagers Attacus Finch and Moonlight Graham often wondered what they could do to help others. They probably emulated someone who they had seen live a successful life. They saw someone like my grandfather, 40-year president of our hometown bank, enjoy a lifetime of leading, sharing, and giving. I have seen him spend his Christmas Eves taking gifts of food and joy to indigent families. Often when his bank could not justify a loan to someone in need, my grandfather made the loan from his own pocket. He is a real-life Moonlight Graham, a man who has shown me that characters like Dr. Graham and Mr. Finch do much much more than elicit tears and smiles from readers and movie watchers. Through him and others in my family I feel I have acquired the values and the burning desire to benefit others that will form the foundation for a great life. I also feel that that foundation is not enough. I do not yet have the sophistication, knowledge, and wisdom necessary to succeed as I want to in the adult world. I feel that Harvard, above all others, can guide me toward the life of greatness that will make me the Attacus Finch of my town.</p><p>Comments:</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This applicant chose characters who demonstrated specific traits that reflect on his own personality. We believe that he is sincere about his choices because his reasons are personal (being from a small town, and so forth). He managed to tell us a good deal about himself, his values, and his goals while maintaining a strong focus throughout.</p><br />
