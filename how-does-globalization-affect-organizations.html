A. A small increase in greenhouse gas concentration can have a large effect on increasing global warming. Once released into the atmosphere greenhouse gases remain potent for many years making it difficult to reverse the process. 
B. Humans have altered a natural process and exaggerated changes that might normally occur over millions of years. 
C. Abrupt changes to the climate system may have unintended outcomes that may pose challenges for societies like more extreme weather, the spread of diseases, a decline in marine life, or an alteration of ocean circulation patterns. 
D. All of the above 
12. Which activities are the largest contributors to greenhouse gasses? 
A. Transportation and electricity generation 
B. Deforestation and agriculture 
C. Industry and landfills 
D. All of the above 
Competency: Discuss how energy from the Sun interacts with the layers of the atmosphere. 
13. How does energy from the sun interact with the layers of the atmosphere? 
A. The sun’s energy enters the top of the atmosphere as shortwaves radiations and makes its way down to the ground without reacting with the greenhouse gases. As the long wave’s radiation goes up into the atmosphere, it is absorbed by greenhouse gases. 
B. Temperature differences in the atmosphere are a result of the way solar energy is absorbed as it moves through the atmosphere. 
C. Sunlight hits the earth most directly at and near the equator, the extra energy absorbed there to heat up the air, land, and water. The heat from land band water gets sent back up into the air heating it even more. D. All discussions are correct.
