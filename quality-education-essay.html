                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Our generation is living amidst what can be called as one of the greatest threats in our lifetime to global education. To persevere through this pandemic and persistently educate the coming few generations were treated as a priority at one point in the twelve months of quarantine we have been experiencing. This is how online learning was implemented, although regardless of how effective it may be, our first concern should be its affordability. Jobs and shops have been forced to shut down and it has hit a big impact on the mass' financial statuses, many of which still have children and teens to send to school. The government enforced online classes but failed to see that its price would not make it available to everyone. To pursue education is challenging enough, what more when quality education is the one you need.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            3. Is the online class is effective for the student to experience a high quality of education? essay​</h2><br />
                        For me, online class does not give high quality education to students. It is based on the reason that, students’ comprehension on topic are limited and different compared to the face to face teaching. Students are not 100% percent learning from the online class because the set or environment in which they are learning is different from what they are accustomed. Also, students tend to understand more when they are physically present in a classroom with their teachers and classmates. One of the reasons that hinder the learning of students is the internet connection. We have poor internet connection in our country that is why most of the students are struggling in the online class. And also, students easily get bored just sitting on their rooms and listening to their teachers teach via zoom or goodle meet or other softwares that they are using.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Providing free and open access to content from revered institutions is laudable. But enrollments at elite colleges’ MOOCs do not translate into revenue at the vast majority of colleges and universities, many of them already cash-strapped.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The<strong> COVID-19</strong> pandemic is first and foremost a health crisis. Many countries have <strong>rightly </strong>decided to close schools, colleges and universities. The crisis crystallizes the dilemma policymakers are facing between closing schools <strong>reducing contact and saving lives</strong> and keeping them open <strong>allowing workers to work and maintaining the economy</strong>. The severe short-term disruption is felt by many families around the world: <strong>home schooling is not only a massive shock to parents’ productivity, but also to </strong><strong>children’s social life and learning</strong>. Teaching is moving online, on an untested and unprecedented scale. Student assessments are also moving online, with a lot of trial and error and uncertainty for everyone. Many assessments have simply been cancelled. Importantly, these interruptions will not just be a short-term issue, but can also have long-term consequences for the affected cohorts and are likely to increase inequality.</p><p></p><p>Source: https://voxeu.org/article/impact-covid-19-education</p><p>pa brainliest please. it would help alot :)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Title: Promoting Accessible and Quality Education: A Constitutional Imperative</p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Article XIV, Section 1 of the Philippine Constitution emphasizes the State's responsibility to protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels. This constitutional provision recognizes education as a fundamental right and underscores the State's obligation to ensure that it is accessible to every individual. By prioritizing education and implementing measures to guarantee its availability, the government plays a pivotal role in empowering its citizens and fostering social progress. This essay delves into the significance of Article XIV, Section 1 and examines the steps that the State must take to fulfill its mandate of providing accessible and quality education for all.</p><p></p><p>Accessibility: Bridging the Gap</p><p>Ensuring accessibility is crucial to fulfilling the right to education. While education may be considered a basic right, various socio-economic barriers often hinder individuals from accessing quality education. The State, recognizing these disparities, must take appropriate measures to bridge the accessibility gap. This involves implementing policies that address geographical, economic, and cultural barriers. For instance, establishing schools and educational facilities in remote areas, providing transportation services, and offering scholarships or financial aid programs for marginalized communities are some measures that can help remove barriers and make education accessible to all citizens.</p><p></p><p>Quality Education: A Pathway to Empowerment</p><p>Beyond mere access, the State is also mandated to promote quality education. Quality education equips individuals with the knowledge, skills, and competencies necessary for personal development and societal progress. It fosters critical thinking, creativity, and a sense of social responsibility. To uphold this aspect of Article XIV, Section 1, the government must prioritize investing in well-trained teachers, modern infrastructure, and relevant educational resources. Additionally, curriculum development and regular evaluation of educational institutions are vital to ensure that students receive education of the highest quality. By emphasizing the importance of quality education, the State empowers its citizens to become active participants in nation-building.</p><p></p><p>Inclusive Education: Embracing Diversity</p><p>Another key aspect of Article XIV, Section 1 is the State's responsibility to make education accessible to all citizens, regardless of their backgrounds or abilities. Inclusive education emphasizes providing equal opportunities for individuals with disabilities, indigenous peoples, and other marginalized groups. The government must promote an inclusive educational system that caters to the diverse needs of learners. This can be achieved by implementing inclusive teaching practices, adapting curriculum materials to suit various learning styles, and providing necessary support services such as special education programs, sign language interpreters, and assistive technologies. By embracing diversity and ensuring inclusive education, the State fosters a more equitable and harmonious society.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>Article XIV, Section 1 of the Philippine Constitution enshrines the right of all citizens to quality education and mandates the State to take appropriate steps to make education accessible for all. By fulfilling this constitutional imperative, the government not only upholds fundamental rights but also paves the way for individual empowerment, social progress, and national development. Accessible education bridges gaps, quality education empowers individuals, and inclusive education embraces diversity. As the State works towards promoting accessible and quality education at all levels, it reinforces the belief that education is the cornerstone of a just and prosperous society</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps </p><br />
