</p><p>1.2.1 Contributing to Society through 
</p><p>Knowledge Creation and Utilization 
</p><p>Scientific and technological activities refers to 
</p><p>the elucidation of unknown phenomena, and to the 
</p><p>creation of new knowledge through the discovery of 
</p><p>new natural laws and principles, and the new 
</p><p>knowledge obtained is then utilized in the real 
</p><p>society. The essence of how science and technology 
</p><p>contributes to society is the creation of new 
</p><p>knowledge, and then utilization of that knowledge 
</p><p>to boost the prosperity of human lives, and to solve 
</p><p>the various issues facing society. 
</p><p>With the shift to a knowledge-based society well 
</p><p>underway in the opening years of the 21st century, 
</p><p>the creation of new knowledge is an increasingly 
</p><p>important aspect of scientific and technological 
</p><p>activities, and the role of science in this knowledge 
</p><p>creation is important for the realization of “science 
</p><p>and technology for society.” 
</p><p>The relationship between science and technology 
</p><p>and society, can be described by the example of 
</p><p>rain falling on a mountain. Rain that has fallen on a 
</p><p>mountain does not immediately wash away 
</p><p>downhill. First, it is captured and stored by forests, 
</p><p>giving life to trees and other vegetation and creating 
</p><p>a verdant landscape. This can be compared to the 
</p><p>accumulation of scientific knowledge and the 
</p><p>continuing search for truth, obtained through basic 
</p><p>research, and perhaps demonstrates that science has 
</p><p>intrinsic value in itself. Meanwhile, the rainwater 
</p><p>stored in the forest bubbles out from springs and 
</p><p>flows downhill in a steadily widening stream. A 
</p><p>single stream flow can separate into a large number 
</p><p>of sub-flows, and sometimes the flow can go 
</p><p>underground into a subterranean network. This 
</p><p>situation can be compared to the diversity of 
</p><p>research and development that can arise based on 
</p><p>scientific knowledge, leading to the planting of 
</p><p>various new technological seeds. Eventually, the 
</p><p>river reaches farming communities and urban cities, 
</p><p>where it is utilized for drinking water and other 
</p><p>household purposes, for agricultural or industrial 
</p><p>uses, and for various other needs, universally 
</p><p>benefiting all aspects of society. This is equivalent 
</p><p>to research and development resulting in practical 
</p><p>technologies that boost the prosperity of the 
</p><p>people’s society and lives, and to the utilization of 
</p><p>science and technology in response to various 
</p><p>issues facing society. If the forest fails to capture a 
</p><p>sufficient amount of the falling rain, society will 
</p><p>quickly be faced with drought and people will not 
</p><p>be able to live. In the same way, realization of 
</p><p>societal progress through science and technology 
</p><p>requires a sufficient accumulation of scientific 
</p><p>knowledge. In other words, science can be 
</p><p>considered to be the foundation strength of society. 
</p><p>However, this foundation strength is not something 
</p><p>that can be acquired in a single day or night, but 
</p><p>instead requires a steady, continuous build-up</p><br />

                            23. A. Readings/Discussions Read this essay entitled Put a Little Science in Your Life (by Brian Greene) and answer the questions that follow: "When we consider the ubiquity of cellphones, iPods, personal computers and the Internet, it's easy to see how science (and the technology to which it leads) is woven into the fabric of our day-to-day activities. When we benefit from CT scanners, M.R.I. devices, pacemakers and arterial stents, we can immediately appreciate how science affects the quality of our lives. When we assess the state of the world, and identify looming challenges like climate change, global pandemics, security threats and diminishing resources, we don't hesitate in turning to science to gauge the problems and find solutions. And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hovering on the horizon-stem cells, genomic sequencing, personalized medicine, longevity research, nanoscience, brain-machine interface, quantum computers, space technology-we realize how crucial it is to cultivate a general public that can engage with scientific issues; there's simply no other way that as a society we will be prepared to make informed decisions on a range of issues that will shape the future." Questions: 1. What kind of essay is the given? 2. What argument do the two paragraphs present? 3. Does it give supporting details? Why are supporting details important? Discussion​</h2><br />
