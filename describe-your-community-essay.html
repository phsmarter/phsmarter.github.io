                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Festival is an event ordinarily celebrated by a community and centering on some characteristic aspect of that community and its religion or cultures. It is often marked as a local or national holiday, mela, or eid. A festival constitutes typical cases of glocalization, as well as the high culture-low culture interrelationship.[1] Next to religion and folklore, a significant origin is agricultural. Food is such a vital resource that many festivals are associated with harvest time. Religious commemoration and thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in autumn, such as Halloween in the northern hemisphere and Easter in the southern.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Somatic Pandemonium in Quarantine</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I remember hearing that our brains create the color magenta all on their own. </p><p></p><p>When I was younger I used to run out of my third-grade class because my teacher was allergic to the mold and sometimes would vomit in the trash can. My dad used to tell me that I used to always have to have something in my hands, later translating itself into the form of a hair tie around my wrist.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, I think about the girl who used to walk on her tippy toes. medial and lateral nerves never planted, never grounded. We were the same in this way. My ability to be firmly planted anywhere was also withered. </p><p></p><p>Was it from all the times I panicked? Or from the time I ran away and I blistered the soles of my feet 'til they were black from the summer pavement?</p><p>Emetophobia. </p><p></p><p>I felt it in the shower, dressing itself from the crown of my head down to the soles of my feet, noting the feeling onto my white board in an attempt to solidify it’s permanence.</p><p></p><p>As I breathed in the chemical blue transpiring from the Expo marker, everything was more defined. I laid down and when I looked up at the starlet lamp I had finally felt centered. Still. No longer fleeting. The grooves in the lamps glass forming a spiral of what felt to me like an artificial landscape of transcendental sparks. </p><p></p><p>She’s back now, magenta, though I never knew she left or even ever was. Somehow still subconsciously always known. I had been searching for her in the tremors.</p><p></p><p>I can see her now in the daphnes, the golden rays from the sun reflecting off of the bark on the trees and the red light that glowed brighter, suddenly the town around me was warmer. A melting of hues and sharpened saturation that was apparent and reminded of the smell of oranges.</p><p></p><p>I threw up all of the carrots I ate just before. The trauma that my body kept as a memory of things that may or may not go wrong and the times that I couldn't keep my legs from running. Revelations bring memories bringing anxieties from fear and panic released from my body as if to say “NO LONGER!” </p><p></p><p>I close my eyes now and my mind's eye is, too, more vivid than ever before. My inner eyelids lit up with orange undertones no longer a solid black, neurons firing, fire. Not the kind that burns you but the kind that can light up a dull space. Like the wick of a tea-lit candle. Magenta doesn’t exist. It is perception. A construct made of light waves, blue and red.</p><p></p><p>Demolition.

                            29. Patulong po.Write a short essay that describes unusual scenes in your surroundings now due to pandemic. Use sensory details (words that tell how something looks, feels, tastes, smells, and sounds) to clearly describe your community during the pandemic.​</h2><br />
                        The way we see, hear, taste, touch and smell may never be the same again.<br /><br />Courtesy of COVID-19, we are undergoing a sensory revolution. All of the senses have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic – not because the senses themselves have changed, but because the context and environment in which we sense has been profoundly altered.<br /><br />Sensory historians like myself, who study the ways in which people in the past used their senses to understand and navigate their worlds, find that sensory shifts and perceptions tended to happen very slowly, measured in decades and centuries, not in mere weeks and months.<br /><br />The shift that is happening now is unprecedented.<br /><br />Once-trusty eyes betray us in the face of an invisible enemy. Seeing is no longer believing. Those who appear perfectly healthy may be unknowing disease transmitters.<br /><br />But if the cause of COVID-19 is invisible, its effects are emphatically not. Desolate city streets are new sights; the absence of airplane contrails strikes many as almost primordial; masks render once-familiar faces unrecognizable.<br /><br />Soundscapes have changed, as have habits of listening. Coronavirus spreaders are sometimes described as “silent.” Many urban dwellers hear less traffic and formerly smothered sounds – such as birdsong – now can be heard.<br /><br />The world is in some ways a much quieter place. Seismic sensors are picking up activity that used to be drowned out by the activity of cities. None of these sounds is new, but the effects of COVID-19 have reconfigured habits of listening and thresholds of hearing. Human voices are louder because there are no whispers at six feet.<br /><br />The sense of smell has been hit hard. To breathe, after all, is to smell – if you can. Anosmia – the loss of the sense of smell – is an early sign of infection.<br /><br />Even if we keep our sense of smell, we now pause before inhaling, lest we breathe in an enemy we cannot see.<br /><br />Taste is no longer as easily sated, and palates are rearranged. Restaurants still cater, but in takeout fashion and with less variety. Hot food once served in the restaurant is colder and less palatable after it’s transported to the more distant dining room table. Clammy hamburgers on soggy buns served with limp french fries, anyone? Grocery stores now ration once taken-for-granted staples, notably eggs, milk and meat.<br /><br />Touch is the obvious sensory casualty in all of this. Centuries of handshaking habits have evaporated; high fives are gone. Outside of families, hugs, kisses and nuzzles have all been lost with the fear of infection.<br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Arts in the Philippines refer to all the various forms of the arts that have developed and accumulated in the Philippines from the beginning of civilization in the country up to the present era. They reflect the range of artistic influences on the country's culture, including indigenous forms of the arts, and how these influences have honed the country's arts. These arts are divided into two distinct branches, namely, traditional arts and non-traditional arts.Each branch is further divided into various categories with subcategories.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>i hope its help</p><p></p><p>i think im wrong so if im wrong just report it</p><br />
