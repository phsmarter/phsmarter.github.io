                        <p>The problem of dead poet society, an issue being raised in the story: Keating way vs. Welton way is the conflict between two different teaching methods. The Welton Academy, where the story takes place, is a prestigious all-boys preparatory school that follows a traditional and conservative teaching style. Mr. Keating, a new English teacher at the school, encourages his students to think for themselves and to pursue their passions. This creates a conflict between the two teaching styles, which ultimately leads to the tragic events of the story.</p><br />

It highlights the struggle of young people to find their own identities in a society that values conformity and obedience. Keating's teachings challenge the students to think critically and creatively, and to question the established norms and traditions.</p><p></p><p>Overall, "Dead Poets Society" is a thought-provoking and inspiring book that encourages readers to embrace their individuality and follow their dreams.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>“Formalism” is, as the name implies, an interpretive approach that emphasizes literary form and the study of literary devices within the text. The name “formalism” was chosen by opponents of the literary movement who considered the approach controversially structured and formal. The critics wondered why the author’s sociopolitical positioning was ignored yet it was the main source of insights and motivation during composition. According to the formalists’ argument, formalism was an attractive approach since one could devise a methodology that was applicable across a wide cross-section of literary works, regardless of geographical or historical considerations. “Formalism,” like “structuralism,” sought to place the study of literature ona scientific basis through objective analysis of the motifs, devices, techniques, and other “functions” that comprise the literary work. The formalists placed great importance on the literariness of texts, those qualities that distinguished the literary from other kinds of writing. Neither author nor context was essential for the formalists; it was the narrative that spoke, the “hero-function,” for example, that had meaning. Form was the content. A plot device or narrative strategy was examined for how it functioned and compared to how it had functioned in other literary works.</p><p></p><p> </p><br />

                            29. what is the summary about a poem Dead Water?
the poem i ask is based in a text book English for Academic and Professional Purposes.</h2><br />
                        Nineteenth-century New Orleans is a blazing hotbed of scorching politics and personal vendettas. And it's into this fire that Benjamin January falls when he is hired to follow Oliver Weems, a bank official who has absconded with $100,000 in gold and securities. But it's more than just a job for January. The missing money is vital to the survival of the school for freed slaves that he and his wife Rose have founded. <br /><br />Following the suspected embezzler--and the money--onto the steamboat Silver Moon, January, Rose, and their friend Hannibal Sefton are sworn to secrecy about the crime until they can find the trunks containing the stolen loot. And then the unexpected happens: Weems is found murdered and suddenly the job of finding the pirated stash grows not only more difficult--but more deadly. There is no shortage of suspects--from the sinister slave-dealer to the bullying steamship pilot to the suspiciously innocent "lady" with connections to every river pirate in the riotous port of Natchez-Under-the-Hill--who all seem to have something to hide. <br /><br />Now, with time running out, January seeks clues wherever he can find them--and allies among whoever can help. Working in tandem with a young planter named Jefferson Davies, he must uncover the dark web of corruption, betrayal, and greed that has already cost one man his life...and, if he can't catch a brutal, remorseless killer, will soon cost January and his friends theirs.<br />

                            30. How does each of the members of the Dead Poet society contribute to the development of the movie's plot?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Each of them portrays students perceptives about how studying or learning poetry. One is chill, forced, go with the flow and determined to learn poetry. However, when Mr. Keating came to the picture, something changed; their philosophy about education and poetry. Each of them showed interest on how to learn poetry to the point that they've come to discover The Dead Poet Society of course through the influence of Mr. Keating. Through poetry, one was able to find his one true love; through poetry Neil was able to experienced becoming the person he really wants to be: an actor before he took his life out of cruelty of situation between his family and his forced profession; through poetry Ethan Hawk was able to let out his barbaric yawk beautifuly even though he has lots of insecurity and full of doubt of himself due to the expectations of his parents to him. </p><br />
