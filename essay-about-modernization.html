                        <p> As a Filipino citizen, I have been exposed to the values, culture and traditions of my country since I was a child. Growing up in the Philippines has shaped me into the person I am today and has had a profound influence on my life. </p><p></p><p>The Filipino culture is one that is deeply rooted in respect for elders, family values and strong religious beliefs. Respect for elders is an important part of our culture; it is expected that children will show respect to their parents and other adults in their lives. This value has been instilled in me from an early age, teaching me to be respectful of those around me regardless of age or status. </p><p></p><p>Family values are also highly valued within Filipino culture; family members are expected to look out for each other’s well-being and support one another through difficult times. This value has taught me the importance of being there for my loved ones when they need it most, as well as how to be supportive even when things get tough. </p><p></p><p>Religion plays an important role in Filipino culture; many Filipinos practice Catholicism or some form of Christianity which influences our daily lives greatly. This value has taught me about faithfulness and humility, as well as how to live according to God’s will rather than my own desires or ambitions. It also serves as a reminder that no matter what happens in life, God will always be there with us if we turn towards Him with faith and trust Him with our lives. </p><p></p><p>These traditional values have had a great impact on modern society here in the Philippines; they serve as reminders that we should always strive towards being better people by respecting others regardless of age or status, looking out for our loved ones during difficult times and living according to God’s will rather than our own desires or ambitions. These values have helped shape who I am today by teaching me valuable lessons about life which I carry with me wherever I go – something which makes me proud to call myself a Filipino citizen!</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong, pa brainliest nmn</p>Here, take a look at the pictures above. hope it helps ^-^]✓<p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Transportation modernization has brought significant changes to the lives of many Filipinos. The Philippines is an archipelago consisting of over 7,000 islands, making transportation a crucial aspect of daily life. The modernization of transportation systems, such as the development of new roads, highways, and the introduction of modern public transportation, has significantly impacted the daily lives of Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>One of the most visible effects of transportation modernization is the reduction in travel time. The construction of new roads and highways, as well as the introduction of faster modes of transportation such as trains and buses, has made it possible for Filipinos to travel from one place to another more quickly and efficiently. This has allowed people to save time and money, which they can use for other purposes.</p><p></p><p>The modernization of transportation has also improved access to goods and services. With the development of new roads and highways, goods can be transported more efficiently from one place to another. This has led to a decrease in the cost of goods and services, making them more affordable for many Filipinos. The improvement in transportation has also made it easier for businesses to reach new customers, increasing economic activity and providing more employment opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Another significant effect of transportation modernization is the improvement of public transportation. The introduction of modern buses, trains, and other modes of transportation has made commuting easier and more comfortable for many Filipinos. This has also resulted in a decrease in traffic congestion, which has been a major problem in many cities in the Philippines. The modernization of public transportation has also provided a safer and more reliable means of transportation for Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>However, transportation modernization has also brought some negative effects. The development of new roads and highways has led to the displacement of many communities, and the construction of new transportation infrastructure has often resulted in environmental damage. Additionally, the modernization of transportation has made car ownership more accessible for many Filipinos, leading to an increase in air pollution and traffic congestion in some areas.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, transportation modernization has had a significant impact on the lives of many Filipinos. The development of new roads, highways, and modern public transportation has improved access to goods and services, reduced travel time, and provided a safer and more reliable means of transportation. While there have been negative effects, the benefits of transportation modernization outweigh the costs, and the government must continue to invest in the development of modern transportation infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>that is the answer to your question </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pls rate me</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Jeepney phase-out</strong></p><p>  <strong>   Modernizing </strong>the jeepneys is the appropriate move by the administration. Transportation modernisation is unquestionably required if, by its own description, a contemporary transport is "roadworthy, safe, and reliable" and, most all, "prevents pollution" or has "emissions within acceptable levels." <strong>Modernizing the transportation system </strong>offers advantages, no doubt. This new replacement market will be welcomed by car dealers, manufacturers, and financiers as it will result in huge increases in business. However, there are advantages and disadvantages to the jeepney phase-out, particularly when we consider one of the key stakeholders: the drivers. The ability to increase employment across the nation is one of the main benefits of modernizing the jeepney. The modernization of the jeepney could increase the demand for qualified operators and drivers. The necessity for newer models has increased the demand for workers and laborers in the automotive industry. Due to their high carbon emissions, older jeepney models are frequently found to be in violation of the Clean Air Act. </p><p>     Modernizing jeepneys is one of the initiatives that the administration thinks is appropriate as the nation shifts to a more environmentally friendly perspective. A considerable reduction in carbon emissions is anticipated with newer units. The jeepney phaseout is a persistent problem that has an impact on many areas of the nation. Stakeholders, from commuters to jeepney drivers, have discussed the issue's apparent benefits and drawbacks. Many professionals and citizens continue to offer their opinions on how transport modernization might be accomplished more effectively, despite the government's decision to put this on hold.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>Jeepney phase-out: </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/1948277</p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />

                            19. Three part essay about an invention that helped society in modern times</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Humans see problems and immediately start thinking of ways to fix them in the community, at work, at school, and at home by creating a new tool or technology. For example, microwaves were invented to heat food quickly, calendars were made to keep track of time, and computers were developed to process and store data. Many inventions have completely changed our lifestyles, like the invention of electricity. Other inventions merely make life more convenient, like dishwashers and lint rollers. Some of the most impactful inventions of the nineteenth century that changed the way we live were the telephone, the bicycle, and plastic.</p><p></p><p>       The telephone was an important invention because it enabled real-time communication with people in another location. Before the telephone, real-time communication was limited by location. People physically had to be in the same location in order to get an immediate answer to a question or quickly make plans with someone. Once the telephone was invented, that changed. This new possibility for real-time communication inspired other, more updated forms of communication that we use today. The telephone was an invention that influenced the way we communicate with people who are not physically with us by making real-time communication possible.</p><p></p><p>       Another very important invention from the nineteenth century was the bicycle because it was a unique form of transportation available to anyone. Like the telephone, the bicycle saved time. Before the bicycle was invented, people walked to many of the places they needed to travel to because it was inexpensive. However, it takes a long time to walk long distances. There were other, more expensive types of transportation like horses (or wagons that were pulled by horses) or the train. The bicycle was different from these forms of transportation because it was inexpensive and available to everyone. After the bicycle was invented, people began thinking about how to make the bicycle move without the rider providing the energy, and other forms of transportation were invented, like the motorcycle. Bicycles were one large influence on transportation.</p><p></p><p>       Finally, plastic was a revolutionary invention because it made certain products cheaper, but it also introduced a new attitude into society. Instead of selling something like soda in a glass bottle, many people started producing plastic bottles, which decreased the cost of many products. The low cost of many plastic products brought an interesting attitude with it; since it was so inexpensive, people began throwing them away instead of washing them. In recent years, many campaigns have been started to encourage people to reverse this new disposable attitude and recycle more. Plastic definitely changed the way many people live and the way many people think about living.</p><p></p><p>       It is obvious that these three nineteenth-century inventions dramatically changed the way people lived. Those changes were so profound that they have endured, and many of us could not imagine life without them. That's what many inventions simply seem to do: change the way people live. Hopefully these changes are for the better. Modern lifestyles will continue to change as new problems arise and people invent things to solve them. It is hard at times to think about life without these modern tools like microwaves and calendars. One thing is certain; we aren't done inventing things yet! There are still future problems to solve and innovations to create.</p><p></p>ExplanationI am not sure but hope it's help<p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>THE ADVANTAGES OF MODERNIZATION AS PART OF SOCIAL CHANGE:</strong></p><p>There are several positive social impacts of modernization in society. The first is to strengthen integration in society. The characteristics of modern humans include having an open attitude to forms of experience and change.

Finally, people experience changes in behavior and way of life with science and technology that continues to develop.</p><p></p><p><strong>THE DISADVANTAGES OF MODERNIZATION AS PART OF SOCIAL CHANGE:</strong></p><p>The negative social impacts of modernization can lead to social inequality. This can be seen through the phenomenon of the occurrence of social groups such as hawkers, unemployed, street vendors and others. Second, it can lead to a strengthening of the gap between educated and uneducated people and can lead to changes in the social order that exists in society. There is an economic gap that can be seen through the difference between the lives of the rich and the poor, thus triggering the emergence of a consumptive culture and a culture of demonstration effect or like to show off. Third, modernization can have an impact on increasing crime, because everyone has the desire to be able to outperform others and try to achieve this goal in various ways, including criminal means. Finally, there is a shift in values ​​in local culture. The loss of customs from the local culture of the community that has been passed down from generation to generation and becomes one of the attractions and unique values ​​in society.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about description of modernity and modern philosophy:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2938899</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

Last year, he fought overseas for all American lives, but he is also trying to free the Iraqi government and people.</p><p></p><p>This article is a comparison of Beowulf and modern heroes. I think American soldiers are my contemporary hero. In this article, I will explain how my modern hero resembles Beowulf in three paragraphs. In these three paragraphs, I will show you how they are fighting for just cause, how they are rewarded for what they are doing, and how they are respected I will discuss. - Ideal contrast between Catch-22 and Beowulf's hero Catch-22's unique warrior, John Oossarian and Danish hero Beowulf are the protagonists of their story, but they are drawing two different hero ideals at first glance . Yossarian has been classified as an outsider, even a cowardly, motivating individualist, even his unusual name.</p><br />

                            26. Write a Reflective Essay about Filipino Values, Culture and Tradition that affects modern influence of today as a Filipino Citizen.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>As a Filipino citizen, I have been exposed to various values, culture, and traditions that are deeply ingrained in our society. These aspects of our identity have shaped the way we live our lives and interact with others. Our values, culture, and traditions have been passed down from generation to generation, and they continue to have a significant impact on our daily lives.</strong></p><p></p><p>One of the most prominent Filipino values that I have observed is the value of close family ties. In our culture, family always comes first. We are taught to respect and care for our elders, and we are expected to help out our family members in times of need. This value is evident in the way we celebrate important occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and other significant milestones. It is common for families to come together and celebrate these events with great enthusiasm, showcasing the unity and love that exists within our families.</p><p></p><p>Another significant aspect of Filipino culture is our deep religious faith. Religion plays a significant role in our lives, and it is reflected in our daily practices and beliefs. Our religious values have instilled in us the importance of respect, humility, and compassion towards others. We believe that by being good and living a life according to our faith, we can make the world a better place.</p><p></p><p>Filipino traditions and customs also play a vital role in shaping our identity. For instance, the practice of “bayanihan,” which is a spirit of communal unity and cooperation, is still evident in many rural areas. The concept of “utang na loob,” or a sense of indebtedness to someone who has done you a favor, is another example of how Filipino customs and traditions have shaped our character.</p><p></p><p>However, as a modern Filipino citizen, I also recognize that some aspects of our culture may not be applicable or appropriate in the modern world. For example, some traditional gender roles may not be suitable in today's society, and there is a need to promote gender equality and respect for diversity.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, Filipino values, culture, and traditions have had a significant influence on who we are as a people. As a Filipino citizen, I am proud of our rich culture and traditions, but I also recognize the need to adapt and adjust to the changing times. We need to embrace the positive aspects of our culture and traditions while also being open to change and progress. By doing so, we can continue to uphold our identity as a people and make a positive contribution to the world.</strong></p><p></p><br />
