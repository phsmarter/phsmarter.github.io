Filipinos and Nationalism During the COVID-19 Pandemic As COVID-19 strikes the Philippine nation, people rise together to counter it. At the forefront of the fight against the virus are our healthcare workers and various frontliners. Daily, they face the hazard of infection with their mantra: “We go to work for you. Please stay at home for us.” Healthcare workers who directly work with COVID-positive patients are outnumbered; and due to their first-hand exposure, some staff require quarantine themselves - reducing their numbers. Another big challenge for frontliners is the lack of medical supplies including Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs). Community quarantine and social distancing has not hindered our kababayans in looking for ways to help with the battle. Different groups, individuals, classmates, colleagues - groups big and small - have come together, despite limited resources and movement. Showing everyone that we are all #InThisTogether.

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

Directions: In a one whole sheet of paper, create your own sentence outline out of the provided text. To assess your output, check the given rubrics.Students should not be required to say the Pledge of Allegiance each morning. First of all, "The Pledge of Allegiance" says, "one nation under God"; however, not every student believes in God.: Every time we come to that part, I feel uncomfortable, and I never say the words because I am an atheist, and I don't believe in God. I'm also sure that there are students who believe in God, and they shouldn't have to pretend like they do.Another reason why we shouldn't be forced to say "The Pledge of Allegiance" is because it's unpatriotic. Our country was founded on the ideals of liberty and freedom. How free are we as citizens if we are forced to say a pledge every morning? Finally, I shouldn't have to say the pledge because don't think our country always acts in a way that makes me proud. Sometimes I'm embarrassed by the things that our government does, such as bombing civilian areas in foreign countries. I also think that some of the rich people in this country have more "liberty and justice for all" than the some of poor people do, and that doesn't seem right.In conclusion, although love my country very much, I think there are better ways to show it than by being made to repeat a pledge every morningThesis statement:    Major Topic:       Subtopic:           supporting details:​</a>

But how could that simple shading in your ballot be so important? According to Republic Act No. 8189 known as the Voter’s Registration Act pf 1996, Section 9, all citizens of the Philippines not otherwise disqualified by law who are at least 18 years of age, who shall have resided in the Philippines for at least one year and in place wherein they propose to vote for at least six months immediately preceding the election, may register as a voter. In the next two years, these youth will be the registered voters who will be the key to change what the people are currently experiencing into something better. Recently, we heard news about how people in the government abuse their power of authority like what happened in a slay video which shows how a cop shot a mother and her son mercilessly in front of the cop’s daughter and the victim’s family. Corruption in the national government is also evident like the alleged anomalies in the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (Philhealth). These issues in the government must serve as our eye opener to use our right to vote in a much responsible way.         We should be more educated and aware on how to vote wisely in elections in order to save our country from abusive leaders. We should know the importance of one vote. Let’s be aware and careful on how the people we elected turn to be the exact opposite of what they have promised during the campaign. We should use our right to vote wisely because as we vote, we are giving our trust to the future leaders of the country. We should advocate responsible voting by expressing our opinions and encouraging others on not to engage in illegal acts like vote buying because vote buying is similar to buying their rights as citizens. Let us persuade them not to be deceived by the good sides that candidates put up during campaign period. We should capitalize on the current state of our government and country and let it be the basis for the significant improvements we all hope for. It’s better to be governed by a leader who is responsible and trustworthy than a candidate who only knows how to sugar-coat words and make false promises.Let us agree that voting may look like a small thing, but it is the voice we all have. It is a right that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Voting will help people express their voices and it will be heard through shading in ballots. Voting is part of your democracy, your freedom as a citizen which we should not fail to exercise.If you think that one vote in a sea of millions cannot make a change, think about how raindrops can make floods. It may be a small thing, but it can change course of this game called live. Let your vote count be the game changer.​</a>

He is Eduardo Camela, a fifteen- year-old student of Daet Parochial School in Camarines Norte. Despite his physical defect caused by polio, he has invented four useful things. His latest invention, the Camela Coco-Cell won for him a gold medal from the president and P1,500 in cash at the National Science Fair held by the Department of Science and Technology. He was affected by polio at the age of 3. He is also a very talented painter. He truly exemplifies the proud and talented Filipino. QUESTIONS: 1. Who are the physically handicapped people who showed success in the story? 2. What made them physically handicapped? 3. What was the contribution of ApolinarioMabini in our history? 4. How did Eduardo Camela show his talents? 5. What recognition did Eduardo receive? 6. What made them successful? Explain your answer.​</a>

I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth?

But how could that simple shading in your ballot be so important? According to Republic Act No. 8189 known as the Voter’s Registration Act pf 1996, Section 9, all citizens of the Philippines not otherwise disqualified by law who are at least 18 years of age, who shall have resided in the Philippines for at least one year and in place wherein they propose to vote for at least six months immediately preceding the election, may register as a voter. In the next two years, these youth will be the registered voters who will be the key to change what the people are currently experiencing into something better. Recently, we heard news about how people in the government abuse their power of authority like what happened in a slay video which shows how a cop shot a mother and her son mercilessly in front of the cop’s daughter and the victim’s family. Corruption in the national government is also evident like the alleged anomalies in the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (Philhealth). These issues in the government must serve as our eye opener to use our right to vote in a much responsible way.         We should be more educated and aware on how to vote wisely in elections in order to save our country from abusive leaders. We should know the importance of one vote. Let’s be aware and careful on how the people we elected turn to be the exact opposite of what they have promised during the campaign. We should use our right to vote wisely because as we vote, we are giving our trust to the future leaders of the country. We should advocate responsible voting by expressing our opinions and encouraging others on not to engage in illegal acts like vote buying because vote buying is similar to buying their rights as citizens. Let us persuade them not to be deceived by the good sides that candidates put up during campaign period. We should capitalize on the current state of our government and country and let it be the basis for the significant improvements we all hope for. It’s better to be governed by a leader who is responsible and trustworthy than a candidate who only knows how to sugar-coat words and make false promises.Let us agree that voting may look like a small thing, but it is the voice we all have. It is a right that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Voting will help people express their voices and it will be heard through shading in ballots. Voting is part of your democracy, your freedom as a citizen which we should not fail to exercise.If you think that one vote in a sea of millions cannot make a change, think about how raindrops can make floods. It may be a small thing, but it can change course of this game called live. Let your vote count be the game changer.​</a>

Philippines among other nation suffers the effect of COVID19 Pandemic those in the low- and middle-income earners were greatly affected, how do Filipino cope with this pandemic to show our nationalism? Explain and cite an example.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The ideology of totalitarianism is characterized by a single party rule, state control of the economy, and the use of force and propaganda to maintain power. Kim Jon-un's order to kill the first people who got infected with COVID-19 in North Korea exemplifies this ideology because it shows a willingness to use extreme and violent measures to maintain control over the population, even at the cost of human lives.</p><p></p><p>Women leaders have been successful in handling the pandemic because they tend to prioritize the well-being of their citizens over political considerations. They are more collaborative and empathetic, and they are often better at communicating with the public. These qualities are often associated with feminism, which emphasizes the importance of social justice and equality. Women leaders also tend to be more open to different perspectives and less hierarchical in their decision-making, which can lead to more effective policies and greater trust in government.</p><p></p><p>Filipinos have coped with the pandemic by showing resilience and solidarity. Many have volunteered to help those in need, such as by distributing food or providing medical care. The community spirit that has emerged during the pandemic reflects a strong sense of nationalism, where people are willing to help each other and work together to overcome challenges. For example, the Bayanihan E-Konsulta program allows people to consult with doctors online for free, helping to provide medical assistance to those who cannot afford it. This program shows how Filipinos are using technology and innovation to respond to the challenges of the pandemic while demonstrating their patriotism and commitment to the common good.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Nationalism, the deep love and devotion for one's country, is an essential aspect of building a strong and united nation. It fuels a sense of belonging, ignites patriotic fervor, and drives individuals to contribute positively to their society. In this narrative essay, I aim to explore the significance of nationalism and share personal experiences that have shaped my love for my country. Moreover, I hope to inspire fellow students to embrace nationalism and actively demonstrate their support for our nation</p><p></p><p>My journey towards embracing nationalism began with a deep exploration of my country's history, culture, and heritage. I delved into the stories of our heroes, their sacrifices, and their unwavering dedication to the betterment of our nation. Through books, documentaries, and conversations with older generations, I developed a profound understanding of the struggles our ancestors endured to secure our freedom and independence. In a nation as diverse as ours, celebrating and embracing cultural diversity is a powerful expression of nationalism. I actively participated in cultural festivals, wearing traditional attire, learning traditional dances, and indulging in regional cuisines. These experiences not only fostered a sense of appreciation for our diverse heritage but also promoted unity among different communities, transcending any differences and forging a shared identity.</p><p></p><p>Let us stand together, young and passionate, as we encourage one another to love this nation, to strive for its progress, and to uphold the values that define us. In doing so, we pave the way for a brighter future, a future where our love for our country knows no bounds.</p><br />

Filipinos and Nationalism During the COVID-19 Pandemic As COVID-19 strikes the Philippine nation, people rise together to counter it. At the forefront of the fight against the virus are our healthcare workers and various frontliners. Daily, they face the hazard of infection with their mantra: “We go to work for you. Please stay at home for us.” Healthcare workers who directly work with COVID-positive patients are outnumbered; and due to their first-hand exposure, some staff require quarantine themselves - reducing their numbers. Another big challenge for frontliners is the lack of medical supplies including Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs). Community quarantine and social distancing has not hindered our kababayans in looking for ways to help with the battle. Different groups, individuals, classmates, colleagues - groups big and small - have come together, despite limited resources and movement. Showing everyone that we are all #InThisTogether.

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

                            21. Expand the content of an outline using notes from different sources.A. Directions: In a one whole sheet of paper, create your own sentence outline out of the provided text. To assess your output, check the given rubrics.Students should not be required to say the Pledge of Allegiance each morning. First of all, "The Pledge of Allegiance" says, "one nation under God"; however, not every student believes in God.: Every time we come to that part, I feel uncomfortable, and I never say the words because I am an atheist, and I don't believe in God. I'm also sure that there are students who believe in God, and they shouldn't have to pretend like they do.Another reason why we shouldn't be forced to say "The Pledge of Allegiance" is because it's unpatriotic. Our country was founded on the ideals of liberty and freedom. How free are we as citizens if we are forced to say a pledge every morning? Finally, I shouldn't have to say the pledge because don't think our country always acts in a way that makes me proud. Sometimes I'm embarrassed by the things that our government does, such as bombing civilian areas in foreign countries.

But how could that simple shading in your ballot be so important? According to Republic Act No. 8189 known as the Voter’s Registration Act pf 1996, Section 9, all citizens of the Philippines not otherwise disqualified by law who are at least 18 years of age, who shall have resided in the Philippines for at least one year and in place wherein they propose to vote for at least six months immediately preceding the election, may register as a voter. In the next two years, these youth will be the registered voters who will be the key to change what the people are currently experiencing into something better. Recently, we heard news about how people in the government abuse their power of authority like what happened in a slay video which shows how a cop shot a mother and her son mercilessly in front of the cop’s daughter and the victim’s family. Corruption in the national government is also evident like the alleged anomalies in the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (Philhealth). These issues in the government must serve as our eye opener to use our right to vote in a much responsible way.         We should be more educated and aware on how to vote wisely in elections in order to save our country from abusive leaders. We should know the importance of one vote. Let’s be aware and careful on how the people we elected turn to be the exact opposite of what they have promised during the campaign. We should use our right to vote wisely because as we vote, we are giving our trust to the future leaders of the country. We should advocate responsible voting by expressing our opinions and encouraging others on not to engage in illegal acts like vote buying because vote buying is similar to buying their rights as citizens. Let us persuade them not to be deceived by the good sides that candidates put up during campaign period. We should capitalize on the current state of our government and country and let it be the basis for the significant improvements we all hope for. It’s better to be governed by a leader who is responsible and trustworthy than a candidate who only knows how to sugar-coat words and make false promises.Let us agree that voting may look like a small thing, but it is the voice we all have. It is a right that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Voting will help people express their voices and it will be heard through shading in ballots. Voting is part of your democracy, your freedom as a citizen which we should not fail to exercise.If you think that one vote in a sea of millions cannot make a change, think about how raindrops can make floods.

                            27. TASK 1: Read the story about Eduardo Camela then answer the questions that follow. Many people succeed in life even if they are physically handicapped. Our country took pride of ApolinarioMabini, a polio victim and yet he became the "Brain" of Katipunan. In these modern times we have a good example from the Bicol Region. He is Eduardo Camela, a fifteen- year-old student of Daet Parochial School in Camarines Norte. Despite his physical defect caused by polio, he has invented four useful things. His latest invention, the Camela Coco-Cell won for him a gold medal from the president and P1,500 in cash at the National Science Fair held by the Department of Science and Technology. He was affected by polio at the age of 3. He is also a very talented painter. He truly exemplifies the proud and talented Filipino. QUESTIONS: 1. Who are the physically handicapped people who showed success in the story? 2. What made them physically handicapped? 3. What was the contribution of ApolinarioMabini in our history? 4. How did Eduardo Camela show his talents? 5. What recognition did Eduardo receive? 6. What made them successful? Explain your answer.​</h2><br />

                            28. I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4. What did the writer mean by putting words into action based on the poems and essays written by our national heroes in the past? 5-6. How can you prove your love for your country in times of war?
