When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

                                            Activity 4 Write an opinion essay on this topic "climate change " Use opinion expressions to emphasize your point. In writing your essay, you may use the following structure. Paragraph 1 - Write an introduction to your essay. State your main idea or the point you are trying to prove and give two reasons for your stand. Example: In my opinion, Covid-19 forced us to take a break from our normal activities and continue living in the comfort of our own homes. Because of this pandemic, many kinds of hero stepped forward to save lives and protect the vulnerable. On the other hand, a lot of workers lost their jobs while some decided to commit crimes to answer the call of a rumbling stomach. Paragraph 2 and 3 Write the body of your essay. Explain in detail the reasons you have stated in your first paragraph. Develop a paragraph for each reason you have cited. Example: Front liners took their oath seriously to save lives no matter what is at stake. They left behind their worrying families to combat an invisible enemy. Good Samaritans readily offered their resources to feed both the front liners and the hungry. Good Samaritans offered a portion of their wealth to help put a stop to this viral outbreak. The more people were encouraged to apply social distancing, the more they got closer to their loved ones. On the contrary, we have witnessed how some took advantage of the situation to satisfy their personal interests. We have seen how oppression happened just because the victims were helpless. We had a glimpse of the wolves hiding behind sheep's clothing. ragraph 4-Write your conclusion. Sum up your position by restating your in idea and finishing with a "call to action."​</a>

I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

Seventeenth-century images emphasized the title character’s pompous folly as well as the often rough-and-tumble action of many episodes.

The first representation of the scene appears in a Frankfurt edition of 1648, in which the windmill sail stabs Don Quixote.

In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag and off I went to collect my friends by way of bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn.

Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be.
What narrative device was used in the paragraph?
The correct answer is: Flashback
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

                            5. For items 6-10, read the passage below to answer the following items. It is odd, but in our family, love always began with a fall of some form or another. This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

                            11. Activity 4 Write an opinion essay on this topic "climate change " Use opinion expressions to emphasize your point. In writing your essay, you may use the following structure. Paragraph 1 - Write an introduction to your essay. State your main idea or the point you are trying to prove and give two reasons for your stand. Example: In my opinion, Covid-19 forced us to take a break from our normal activities and continue living in the comfort of our own homes. Because of this pandemic, many kinds of hero stepped forward to save lives and protect the vulnerable. On the other hand, a lot of workers lost their jobs while some decided to commit crimes to answer the call of a rumbling stomach. Paragraph 2 and 3 Write the body of your essay. Explain in detail the reasons you have stated in your first paragraph. Develop a paragraph for each reason you have cited. Example: Front liners took their oath seriously to save lives no matter what is at stake. They left behind their worrying families to combat an invisible enemy. Good Samaritans readily offered their resources to feed both the front liners and the hungry. Good Samaritans offered a portion of their wealth to help put a stop to this viral outbreak. The more people were encouraged to apply social distancing, the more they got closer to their loved ones. On the contrary, we have witnessed how some took advantage of the situation to satisfy their personal interests. We have seen how oppression happened just because the victims were helpless. We had a glimpse of the wolves hiding behind sheep's clothing. ragraph 4-Write your conclusion. Sum up your position by restating your in idea and finishing with a "call to action."​</h2><br />

When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!"

I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

It had been months since I had spoken to anyone outside of my family, but this breeze was different. I didn’t even know his name, but I felt a sense of comfort in his presence. Every day after school, he would be waiting for me, never too far away. He helped me find my way out of loneliness, and I learned to appreciate the little things—the sound of leaves rustling in the breeze, the soft glow of the sunset, the feeling of sand between my toes.</p><p></p><p>He brought me joy that I had never known before, and taught me to never take life too seriously. He taught me to laugh, dance and make the most of life. He showed me the beauty of nature and how wonderful the world can be when you are in love.</p><p></p><p>We never spoke, and yet our bond grew stronger with each passing day. We were inseparable, and soon I found myself deeply in love with him. He was my first love, and will forever remain in my heart.</p><br />

In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic.

Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be.
What narrative device was used in the paragraph?
The correct answer is: Flashback
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.
