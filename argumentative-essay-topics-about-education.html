                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Being educated doesn't only mean attaining the degree you always wanted to get. A well-educated person also shows great potential, a good attitude, and is a person who cares for his community. Education plays a vital role in our lives. It helps us to achieve our dreams, to learn new things, and to enhance our skills and knowledge. That is why we should take our studies seriously. Our performance in school reflects who we are. Sure, grades don't define who you are, grades are just a number, and most importantly, grades shouldn't question your worth as a person. However, your grades will affect your future. Good grades will make you get a scholarship. It will lessen the burden on your parents. That's why education is important, more so your grades. Don't always believe in what you read on social networks, get the education you deserve because grades alone won't make you on top but they will surely make an impact on your life. In other words, education is crucial, as it is now and also to the future.</p><br />

Mental health refers to a person's psychological, emotional, and social well-being; it influences what they feel and how they think, and behave. The state of cognitive and behavioural well-being is referred to as mental health. The term 'mental health' is also used to refer to the absence of mental disease. </p><p>Mental health means keeping our minds healthy. Mankind generally is more focused on keeping their physical body healthy. People tend to ignore the state of their minds. Human superiority over other animals lies in his superior mind. Man has been able to control life due to his highly developed brain. So, it becomes very important for a man to keep both his body and mind fit and healthy.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>According to the Department of Education (DepEd) in the Philippines, there are currently over 2 million learners with disabilities enrolled in public and private schools across the country. These learners are entitled to special education services to help them succeed in their academic pursuits. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of special education services has been severely impacted, leading to a decline in the quality of education received by learners with disabilities.</p><p></p><p>One of the challenges facing special education in the Philippines during the pandemic is the lack of access to technology and the internet. With the implementation of distance learning, learners with disabilities who do not have access to the necessary technology and internet connection are at a disadvantage. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of learners with disabilities who are able to participate in online classes.</p><p></p><p>Another issue is the lack of training and resources for teachers who are tasked with providing special education services. Many teachers are not equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to provide effective online special education services. This has resulted in the quality of education received by learners with disabilities being compromised.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the pandemic has exacerbated the existing inequalities in the education system. Learners with disabilities from low-income families are particularly vulnerable, as they may not have access to the same resources and support as their peers from more affluent backgrounds. This further widens the gap in the quality of education between different groups of learners.</p><p></p><p>In light of these challenges, it is imperative that the government takes action to address the issues facing special education in the Philippines during the pandemic. This includes providing learners with disabilities with the necessary technology and internet connection, as well as providing teachers with the training and resources they need to effectively deliver special education services online. Additionally, more support should be given to learners from low-income families to ensure that they are not left behind.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the pandemic has brought to light the challenges facing special education in the Philippines. It is crucial that the government takes action to address these challenges and ensure that learners with disabilities are not left behind. By providing the necessary support and resources, we can ensure that all learners have access to quality education, regardless of their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Study hard,hope it help</p><br />

Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Since 1990s STEM is a term used to refer education policies to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. But is much more, because it has implications for workforce development, teaching frameworks, industries, no formal education, etc. Is a term which also involves the equity of a country and some challenges like the gender gap.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Art education is crucial for the children's development. Many school boards feel that art education is not a necessity and not very important in the lives of today's students. Art classes are constantly compared to the main core classes, such as math and English. Many people feel that core classes are much more valuable to a child's education, which is why art may be cut first from schools if there is low funding. Art classes offer children critical lessons about life that they are not exposed to in any of the other classes. Art teachers drive the creativity and the imagination of students, while allowing students to express themselves.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected education globally, including special education. In the Philippines, where special education is still a developing field, the pandemic has highlighted the need for further improvements in the sector. Despite some positive developments, the state of special education in the Philippines during the pandemic is still inadequate.</p><p></p><p>One positive development in the Philippines is the increased awareness and attention given to special education during the pandemic. The government has launched various initiatives, including the provision of assistive technology and online training for teachers to support students with special needs. Additionally, the Department of Education (DepEd) has released guidelines for distance learning for students with disabilities.</p><p></p><p>However, these initiatives fall short in addressing the needs of all students with special needs in the country. For instance, the provision of assistive technology has been limited and not enough to support all students with disabilities. Additionally, online training for teachers is not enough to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to support students with different learning needs.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the pandemic has exposed the already existing challenges in special education in the Philippines. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, the government has failed to ensure that all children with disabilities have access to education. Many students with disabilities face barriers to enrollment, such as lack of transportation, inaccessible classrooms, and insufficient support services. The pandemic has only made these challenges more evident, with many students with disabilities unable to access distance learning materials and services.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while some progress has been made in the field of special education in the Philippines during the pandemic, the state of special education is still inadequate. The government must do more to address the barriers to education faced by students with disabilities, including the provision of more assistive technology and support services, and the improvement of teacher training. Only then can students with special needs receive the education they deserve, even during these challenging times.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>#Carry on learning George Washington was the first and most popular U.S. President. He was the only one elected by a unanimous 
</p><p>vote. It is often said of him that he was “first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.” 
</p><p>Washington led comparatively untrained and ill-equipped American soldiers to victory over the well-trained British in 
</p><p>the Revolutionary War. As soon as the Constitution was ratified, he was chosen to be President.
</p><p>Many of the generals who had fought under Washington did not believe that the 13 colonies could cooperate to 
</p><p>form a single country without the strong leadership of a king. They approached him, saying that they would support 
</p><p>him as King George I of the United States. Washington was dismayed at the idea and asked the generals to promise 
</p><p>never to mention it again. He served two terms as President and refused a third term, retiring to his farm in Virginia. 
</p><p>When England‟s King George heard that Washington had voluntarily given up the power of the presidency, he said, 
</p><p>“If that is true, he is the greatest man in history.”
</p><p>According to the text, why was Washington considered the most popular president?
</p><p>A. King George I said, “He is the greatest man in history?”
</p><p>B. He was elected president by a unanimous vote.
</p><p>C. He wanted to become a powerful man and king.
