                            1. Write an essay about the importance of valuing time.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Valuing Time is Showing Respect<p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>Time is gold. This is cliche but it is very true. Time, when it has elapsed could no longer be retrieved. There is no time machine that can bring us back to the past. The theory of relativity points to that. That time only moves forward. So it is critical that we value whatever time we have and the people we give it to.  </p><p>
</p><p>Giving our time to someone is perhaps the best gift we can every give anyone.l Hence, if you we are on the receiving end of this gesture, we should be valuing the time given to you. This goes for both school and personal matters. Teachers give us the time when they teach us the lessons. Before going to class they made sure they are prepared, hence we show appreciation by studying well. The same goes for our parents and guardians who have put in time to work for our education.  </p><p>
</p><p>In our personal relationships as well, this is applicable. Our friends, despite all the assignments and activities they have to do on a daily basis still give us time so we can hangout. This has to be valued and appreciated. When with them we should give them full attention.
</p><p>
</p><p>So be it at school, in the home or with our friends, valuing time is a kind gesture. This reflects our character as people who are cognizant of the importance of people's time.</p><p></p><p><strong>For more information: </strong></p><p>Respect: https://brainly.ph/question/1891095</p><br />

                            2. sports in time of crisis: is it really important? Essay ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sports have traditionally served as a global unifies. Race, religion, politics, socioeconomic status and gender are all thrown out the window when supporters band together to celebrate (or commiserate) the result of a competition.</p><p>As Nelson Mandela once said: “Sport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does.”</p><p>With the world in the midst of the corona virus pandemic and people feeling more isolated now more than ever with borders closed and stay-at-home mandates in place, sports—its athletes, personalities, executives, coaches, leagues, teams and fans—can again prove that the cohesive power of more is greater than any single individual.</p><p>“Athletes are role models in society. Kids listen to what athletes say more than they listen to their parents; that’s a reality,” two-time NBA champion Paul Ga sol said. “Let’s utilize that in a time of need like this one in order to send the right message, in order to do the right thing, in order to unite and bring the best out of people in a time of uncertainty and adversity. That’s a chance we have right now. “Instead of looking out for our own or pointing fingers or criticizing or being more separate than we were, it’s a time we can really come together. It’s an opportunity. I hope we don’t waste it.”</p><p>Officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, there are more than 4.7 million confirmed cases of OVID-19 across the globe and more than 380,000 deaths. The world has been in an indefinite standstill.</p><p>MORE FOR YOU</p><p>EWE Extreme Rules 2021 Results: Winners, News And Notes As Roman Reigns Beats The Demon</p><p>The World’s Highest-Paid Soccer Players 2021: Manchester United’s Christian Ronald Reclaims Top Spot From PS's Lionel Mess</p><p>The Good, Bad And Ugly From The Green Bay Packers’ Win Over The San Francisco Erse</p><p>Sports in North America began spiraling into a series of suspensions following the NBA’s swift announcement on March 11 after Utah Jazz center Rudy Robert tested positive. The ML, NHL and MKS are also playing a waiting game this season, while the NFL is attempting to begin its 2020-21 campaign as scheduled on September 10. The 2020 Olympics were postponed until next summer. European soccer leagues were suspended. Nearly two months later as the curve is beginning to flatten in certain countries and U.S. states, various sports have been resurrected under restrictive conditions.</p><p>The PFC held its first live event during the pandemic on May 9 despite a positive test from one of its fighters (whose bout was cancelled). NASCAR returned on May 17 after a nearly two-month hiatus as a result of OVID-19. Germany’s Bundestag was the first major soccer league to restart, hosting games this past weekend without fans while implementing various health and safety measures. Spain’s Kigali is hoping to return by mid-June, while English Premier League PIN -3.7% clubs voted to begin small group training sessions as early as today. “This is a new circumstance, a new situation and it’s not easy to imagine what will happen in the future,” said CF Barcelona vice-president Jodi Carder, who tested positive for OVID-19 in early April. “At the end of the day, it’s a global problem. We are not the only ones affected by it, everyone is affected.</p><p>“.. We have to learn from each other. There are a lot of things to discover because we’re all facing a new reality and it won’t be easy.”</p><p>NBA players including Giannini Contemporaneous, Kevin Love, Zion Williamson, and Blake Griffin, for example, made donations to cover the salaries of hourly workers at arenas across the country. Approximately 100 NBA players and the NBA Players Association Foundation have donated a combined $5.5 million to nonprofits to assist in pandemic relief.</p><p>“I think athletes can play a critical role during this time and during the pandemic,” said Ga sol, who is working with UNICEF, the Red Cross and the Ga sol Foundation to encourage people, especially kids, to remain active and engaged during this time. “Athletes have a tremendous platform to attract people and lead movements. I would encourage any athlete and every athlete to try and do that in a positive manner.”</p><p>“There’s always been this tip-toe kind of dance around politics and crisis when it comes to sports,” Jenkins said. “Some people want to keep sports simply about sports and that’s that, but there’s also a consciousness behind it that sports have a larger responsibility to society that feeds it. … That mentality needs to switch and that starts with league leaders and our country’s leaders to be able to come together not only a national plan but a way to really galvanize people and give hope.”</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> contemporary art allows students to broaden their understanding of themselves, their community, and the world. It helps them become critical thinkers as they consider the influences that led to the creation of each work of art, such as sociopolitical climate, the artist's training, and cultural influence.</p><p>Working in a wide range of mediums, contemporary artists often reflect and comment on modern-day society. ... Contemporary artists working within the postmodern movement reject the concept of mainstream art and embrace the notion of "artistic pluralism," the acceptance of a variety of artistic intentions and styles</p><p></p><p></p><p>Contemporary Art is its aesthetic value. This means that the art possesses some capacity to elicit a sense of pleasure in the viewer. Although, what is considered pleasing to the eye may vary depending on the viewer, given the wide variety of mediums and methods for this style of art there is likely to be some form that will appeal to each person.</p><p></p><p>Given its aesthetic value, contemporary artwork can also be used to decorate many different venues. Even outdoor sculpture parks can contain art and make it easily accessible for anyone to view, while it livens up the city landscape. Not everyone can afford an art print or sculpture, but with reproductions in print, nearly anyone can obtain some piece of artwork to personalize their home</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Importance of Collaboration in Today's Workplace</p><p>31 Oct 2016</p><p></p><p>return to the previous page</p><p></p><p>Last Updated: September 2020</p><p></p><p>Collaboration in the workplace is nothing new.</p><p></p><p>However, it is becoming increasingly important in the modern world as we become more connected around the globe. Cloud computing and faster internet connections has given rise to tools enabling employees to collaborate with colleagues effectively, producing a more educated, skilled and engaged workforce.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this collaboration is increasingly happening online, rather than in person.</p><p></p><p>The current worldwide pandemic has forced organisations to introduce flexible working from home arrangements for employees, and in turn, requiring collaboration to happen across geographically spread locations. </p><p></p><p>In this article, we delve into why collaboration in the workplace is important, key benefits and what you need to know.</p><p></p><p>Why collaborate? The benefits of collaboration</p><p>When working on a project, an individual often needs the input of other employees. By collaborating with others - different departments or even different offices, skills can be pooled to make the project more successful than it might otherwise be.</p><p></p><p>Employee collaboration not only equals a happier workforce, it represents an educated one.</p><p></p><p>A collaborative workplace naturally cultivates a sense of community within an organisation, with employees feeling almost like they are a part of a family. This compels them to go beyond the expectations of their role, absorbing as much organisational knowledge as possible and driving the business forward with informed and sound decisions.</p><p></p><p></p>#mark as braniest<br />

Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available</p><p>The implementation of quarantine implies the use or creation of appropriate facilities in which a person or persons are physically separated from the community while being cared for. Possible settings for quarantine include hotels, dormitories, other facilities catering to groups, or the contact's home.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>When the Covid-19 pandemic swept across the world in 2020, schools closed and education was moved to students’ homes. Consequently, many countries faced the challenge of an unanticipated and accelerated move to online learning. This represents a crucial time to consider technology, pedagogy and education. Digital technology played a significant role in enabling teachers to teach students at a distance using tools that enabled both synchronous and asynchronous communication with whole class, groups and individual children or young people; access to learning materials; and interactive and collaborative activities. This special issue examines how jurisdictions worldwide responded, the emerging opportunities and considerations; and what we can learn moving forward for the contemporary role of technology in education in times of crisis.<br />

As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people across every state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1] However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right to health fulfilled.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Importance of Physical Activity and Exercise during the COVID-19 Pandemic</p><p>3 Key Points</p><p>Physical activity and exercise can be effective treatment strategies for symptoms of both depression and anxiety.</p><p>Each day is a new opportunity to engage in physical activity and exercise that can bring short and long-term benefits for mood, sleep, and physical health.</p><p>Consistency and sustained motivation may be enhanced by peer support, family support, or electronic platforms offering exercise programs.</p><p>The benefits of physical activity and exercise have been demonstrated across the lifespan. We are meant to move and many of our body’s systems work better when we are consistently physically active.</p><p></p><p>For managing symptoms of depression, some research suggests that elevated levels of aerobic activity (exercise that significantly raises our heart rates) may be associated with greater reductions in depressive symptoms. Consider engaging in physical activity once or twice daily that includes brief periods (30-90 seconds) of greater intensity. For some, this might be accomplished through exercise in their homes including jumping jacks, mountain climbers, and sequencing strength training exercises (i.e. standing squats, push-ups, sit-ups). For others, the use of home exercise equipment such as treadmills, elliptical machines, and stationary bikes may be helpful.</p><p></p><p>Strength-training has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety for individuals with and without an anxiety disorder. Weightlifting using exercise equipment or household items (textbooks, canned goods, milk jugs filled with water, paint cans) may help us to reduce the negative effects of stress and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>For children and adolescents, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and exercise during the day are associated with elevations in self-esteem, improved concentration, reductions in depressive symptoms, and improvements in sleep.</p><p></p><p>For older adults and among individuals managing chronic medical conditions, regular walks are recommended. The benefits of strength training and weightlifting (low weight with high numbers of repetitions) may be even greater in older adults to maintain quality of life and functioning.</p><p></p><p>Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (such as speed-walking or jogging) has been shown to help reduce the use of alcohol and other substances. Additionally, participation in regular physical activity is shown to boost the immune system. Reduction in substance use is also associated with improvement in the body’s ability to fight off infection.</p><p></p><p>Many companies are offering free use of their on-line platforms that may help to identify a variety of in-home activities (indoor cycling, treadmill running, dance cardio, yoga, strength training, and more) to help make exercise more enjoyable during this critical period. We strongly support the idea of ongoing vigilance regarding physical-distancing and limitations on in-person contacts as guided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(link is external).</p><p></p><p>We recommend finding physical activities that you enjoy and to share your experience with others. At the same time, there is also evidence to suggest that exercise can be helpful to mood even if the act of doing the exercise is not as enjoyable.</p><p></p><p>It is important for family members to take a supportive role in the promotion of physical activity and exercise. Allowing individuals to maintain their autonomy and choice in their activities will be important for ongoing engagement.</p><p></p><p>We are all managing additional stress related to the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential to threaten the health of ourselves, our families, and our communities. Please consider using physical activity and exercise as a strategy to maintain health during this stressful period.</p><p></p><p>Although many things feel beyond our control right now, we do have the ability to be creative and to build physical activity and exercise into each of our days. We may even look back on this difficult time as the turning point when we learned new ways to build our emotional resilience and our physical health.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To say Education is important is an understatement. Education is a weapon to improve one’s life. It is probably the most important tool to change one’s life. Education for a child begins at home. It is a lifelong process that ends with death. Education certainly determines the quality of an individual’s life. Education improves one’s knowledge, skills and develops the personality and attitude. </p><p>Most noteworthy, Education affects the chances of employment for people. A highly educated individual is probably very likely to get a good job. In this essay on importance of education, we will tell you about the value of education in life and society.</p><p><strong>Education teaches the ability to read and write. Reading and writing is the first step in Education. Most information is done by writing. Hence, the lack of writing skill means missing out on a lot of information. Consequently, Education makes people literate.Above all, Education is extremely important for employment. It certainly is a great opportunity to make a decent living. This is due to the skills of a high paying job that Education provides. Uneducated people are probably at a huge disadvantage when it comes to jobs. It seems like many poor people improve their lives with the help of Education.</strong></p><p><strong>Better Communication is yet another role in Education. Education improves and refines the speech of a person. Furthermore, individuals also improve other means of communication with Education.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Better Communication is yet another role in Education. Education improves and refines the speech of a person. Furthermore, individuals also improve other means of communication with Education.Education makes an individual a better user of technology.
