                                            Directions: Explain in your own words the meaning of the following statements, which are observations of Kenko in “From Essays in Idleness". Write in 5-10 sentences paragraph form.
1. A certain man who was learning to shoot a bow aimed at the target with two arrows in his hand. His teacher said, “A beginner should not hold two arrows. It will make him rely on the second arrow and be careless with the first. Each time you shoot, you should think not of hitting or missing the target, but of making this one the decisive arrow.” I wonder if anyone with only two arrows would be careless with one of them in the presence of his teacher. But though the pupil is himself unaware of any carelessness, the teacher will notice it. This caution applies to all things (92).
2. A certain hermit once said, “There is one thing that even I, who have no worldly entanglements, would be sorry to give up, the beauty of the sky.” I can understand why he should have felt that way (20).
3. Why do you think the writer believes that the wind has a special power to move men’s hearts and soothe the grieving man? Elaborate your answers.
4. Do you agree that one can judge a person’s breeding by the way he tells a story or by his laughter? Explain your answer.
5. Why do you think the author says that emptiness accommodates everything? Do you agree with him? Have you ever had a similar experience?</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>SAKURA is a well-known, traditional Japanese folk song. It is also a popular children’s song. This old Japanese song was originally known as Saita Sakura. Sakura, which translates to “Cherry Blossom,” is about the Japanese cherry tree. The cherry tree represents beauty, peace and joy in the Japanese culture. But more importantly, the blooming of the cherry tree signifies the arrival of spring and therefore is associated with renewal and rebirth. The song refers to “hanami,” or blossom viewing. “Hanami” is an old tradition in Japan and a favorite pastime of the Japanese people during the spring. There are many versions of the lyrics in the song, but the lyrics all tell the same story. They describe the beauty of the flowering cherry blossoms.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sakura is the name of a traditional Japanese folk song depicting spring, the season of sakura. Contrary to popular belief, the song did not originate from ancient times (as in, not from the Heian period or prior). It was first composed during the Edo period for children learning to play the koto. Originally, the lyrics "Blooming cherry blossoms" were attached to the melody.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The song has been popular since the Meiji period, and the lyrics in their present form were attached then. It is often sung in international settings as a song representative of Japan. Throughout the ages there have been many rearrangements of the song, but Michio Miyagi's rendition is often regarded to be the best of them all. The cherry blossom is Japan's national flower and has for years appeared in the country's poetry, paintings, and music, as well as on its craft, clothing, and other commercial items.</p><p>From January through June each year, there are numerous cherry blossom festivals held throughout Japan. Not surprisingly, there is even this popular traditional song, Sakura, Sakura (Cherry Blossom, Cherry Blossom), commonly sung to celebrate the national flower. Its melody and text date back nearly to Medieval times, and the song has been popular in Japan since at least the eighteenth century. The melody is simple and well-known to Westerners from various commercial incarnations, even if they recognize it only as some generic far Eastern tune. But it is hardly generic-sounding.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG ☺️</p><br />

1. A certain man who was learning to shoot a bow aimed at the target with two arrows in his hand. His teacher said, “A beginner should not hold two arrows. It will make him rely on the second arrow and be careless with the first. Each time you shoot, you should think not of hitting or missing the target, but of making this one the decisive arrow.” I wonder if anyone with only two arrows would be careless with one of them in the presence of his teacher. But though the pupil is himself unaware of any carelessness, the teacher will notice it. This caution applies to all things (92).
2. A certain hermit once said, “There is one thing that even I, who have no worldly entanglements, would be sorry to give up, the beauty of the sky.” I can understand why he should have felt that way (20).
3. Why do you think the writer believes that the wind has a special power to move men’s hearts and soothe the grieving man? Elaborate your answers.
4. Do you agree that one can judge a person’s breeding by the way he tells a story or by his laughter? Explain your answer.
5. Why do you think the author says that emptiness accommodates everything? Do you agree with him? Have you ever had a similar experience?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. In this passage, Kenko reflects on the importance of focus and dedication in all things. He recounts a story of a bow student who holds two arrows in his hand, which makes him careless with the first shot. The teacher advises that a beginner should concentrate on each shot and make it decisive rather than relying on the second arrow. Kenko uses this story to emphasize that we should not take anything for granted and be mindful of every action we take. He suggests that our actions have consequences, and we should pay close attention to them.</p><p></p><p>2. In this passage, Kenko quotes a hermit who expressed his admiration for the beauty of the sky. Kenko reflects on how even someone who has no worldly entanglements can appreciate the natural beauty around them. He implies that beauty transcends the boundaries of social status and that anyone can appreciate it. Kenko believes that appreciating beauty is essential for leading a fulfilling life.</p><p></p><p>3. Kenko believes that the wind has a special power to move men's hearts and soothe a grieving man because he believes that the wind carries the voices of those who have passed away. He thinks that the wind can bring comfort to a grieving person by reminding them that their loved ones are still with them in spirit. Kenko suggests that nature has the power to heal emotional wounds and bring comfort to those who are suffering.</p><p></p><p>4. Kenko suggests that one can judge a person's breeding by the way he tells a story or by his laughter. He implies that someone who tells a story well or has a refined laugh is likely to come from a good background. However, this may not always be true, as some people may have learned storytelling or laughter from others rather than being born into a noble family. Therefore, it is not always accurate to judge someone's breeding by these factors.</p><p></p><p>5. Kenko believes that emptiness accommodates everything because he thinks that an empty mind is open to all possibilities. He implies that an empty mind is free from biases and prejudices, and it can accept and embrace all things. Kenko suggests that we should cultivate an empty mind to appreciate the beauty of life fully.  </p><p>PA BRAINLEST AND FOLLOW</p><p></p><br />
