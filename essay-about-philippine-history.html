                                            Activity 1: Anticipation Guide To start with answer the anticipation guide below to check how much you know about the topic. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answer. Direction: Read and understand carefulh the text below and answer the graphic organizer that follows. It is a given fact that Philippines undergo several typhoons every year but it seems that we are not learning from it. Looking back, when you compare the casualties of catastrophic typhoons that hit the Philippines the trends seem to show that we are not really prepared to face these disasters. For instance, on 23 September 2009, Ondoy affected almost 993,227 families, making it to become one of the worst natural disasters in the Philippines in terms of number of people affected. Out of this attected people, 464 were killed and 520 were injured and a total of 15,798 families were temporarily displaced and took refuge in evacuation centers (Olan, 2014). On the same note, on the 15th day of 2011, Sendong hit the northern part of Mindanao and killed almost 1,439 people. The estimated cost of damages by Typhoon Sendong amounted to P999, 946,415 or close to 1 billion and left 65,067 families homeless (Rappler, 2011). Lastly, Typhoon Haiyan, dubbed as the strongest typhoon to land in the recorded history, affected almost 16 million people, leaving in its wake 6,300 deaths, 4.1 million displaced people and 1.1 million houses damaged (USAID, 2014). When you make sense of these numbers, one can readily grasp that we are not resilient in the face of disasters, we are ill-prepared.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Basketball was first introduced to the Philippine public school system by the Americans as a women's sport in 1910 and was played in Interscholastic meets in 1911 until 1913.In 1898, American colonizers introduced the sport as part of revisions they made to the official Philippine school system. Although the Americans also attempted to teach baseball, basketball was the sport that took off, and just 15 years later, the Philippines won gold in the 1913 Far Eastern GamesIts,.accessibility is a real key to why so many people play it – and it is fast and entertaining too. Basketball suits the life of Filipino teenagers well, and is easy to learn but hard to master.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A nation’s history is the reflection of its culture, traditions and beliefs. Philippine History is no different. It showcases our native Malayan roots, our proud heritage of noble chiefs and fierce warriors, foreign powers and influences that have shaped our country into what it is today, and our countrymen’s efforts in attaining national independence. Truly, our history mirrors the Filipino spirit of faith, bravery and perseverance. On December 8  1941, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. To most Filipinos during that time, there was no doubt that they viewed the Japanese occupation as the darkest period of their lives (Setsuho &amp; Jose,  1999). In the span of 3 years, the invaders brought trauma and marked cruelty in the daily lives of the people. The shock of the outbreak of war, air raids on cities and resultant deaths of civilians are just of few events that menaced the country. </p><p></p><br />

                            4. Activity 1: Anticipation Guide To start with answer the anticipation guide below to check how much you know about the topic. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answer. Direction: Read and understand carefulh the text below and answer the graphic organizer that follows. It is a given fact that Philippines undergo several typhoons every year but it seems that we are not learning from it. Looking back, when you compare the casualties of catastrophic typhoons that hit the Philippines the trends seem to show that we are not really prepared to face these disasters. For instance, on 23 September 2009, Ondoy affected almost 993,227 families, making it to become one of the worst natural disasters in the Philippines in terms of number of people affected. Out of this attected people, 464 were killed and 520 were injured and a total of 15,798 families were temporarily displaced and took refuge in evacuation centers (Olan, 2014). On the same note, on the 15th day of 2011, Sendong hit the northern part of Mindanao and killed almost 1,439 people. The estimated cost of damages by Typhoon Sendong amounted to P999, 946,415 or close to 1 billion and left 65,067 families homeless (Rappler, 2011). Lastly, Typhoon Haiyan, dubbed as the strongest typhoon to land in the recorded history, affected almost 16 million people, leaving in its wake 6,300 deaths, 4.1 million displaced people and 1.1 million houses damaged (USAID, 2014). When you make sense of these numbers, one can readily grasp that we are not resilient in the face of disasters, we are ill-prepared.

The Philippine Revolution of 1896 represents the courage and determination of Filipinos to fight for their freedom and sovereignty. It also highlights the sacrifices and struggles that the country had to endure to achieve its independence.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Philippine Revolution of 1896 serves as a reminder of the country's rich heritage and the importance of preserving it for future generations. By learning about this event, Filipinos can develop a deeper appreciation for their culture, history, and identity.</p><p></p><p>In terms of incorporating different types of news, discussing the Philippine Revolution of 1896 can include current events news as well.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>According to the video, the Cavite Mutiny was led by Andres Bonifacio and other members of the secret society called the Katipunan. The reason behind the mutiny was their desire to seek independence from Spanish colonial rule and to establish a Philippine republic.</p><p>Essay:</p><p></p><p>The 1872 Cavite event can be seen as both a local mutiny and a national revolution. On the one hand, it was a local mutiny in the sense that it was a rebellion against Spanish colonial rule that was limited to the Cavite region. On the other hand, it can also be seen as a national revolution in the sense that it was part of a wider movement for independence that was taking place throughout the Philippines at the time.</p><p></p><p>The Cavite Mutiny is an important event in the history of the Philippines because it marked the beginning of the Philippine Revolution, which eventually led to the country's independence from Spanish colonial rule. It is also significant because it brought to light the issues of colonial oppression, exploitation, and injustice that were prevalent in the Philippines at the time, and helped to galvanize the movement for independence.</p><p></p><p>Based on the sources introduced, my understanding of the past has been enhanced by learning about the different perspectives and interpretations of the Cavite Mutiny. The sources have provided valuable insights into the motivations and goals of the revolutionaries, as well as the context in which the mutiny took place. They have also helped to shed light on the complex and multifaceted nature of the Philippine Revolution, and the many different factors that contributed to it.</p><p></p><p>For the table:</p><p></p><p>CONTENT: The main idea of the Cavite Mutiny is that it was a rebellion against Spanish colonial rule that was led by Andres Bonifacio and other members of the Katipunan.</p><p></p><p>CONTEXT: The Cavite Mutiny took place in the Cavite region of the Philippines in 1872, at a time when the country was still under Spanish colonial rule.</p><p></p><p>COMMUNICATION: The source is reliable because it is based on historical records and accounts of the event.</p><p></p><p>CREATOR: The source was created by historians who have studied the Cavite Mutiny and the Philippine Revolution.</p><p></p><p>CONNECTION: Prior to reading this source, my knowledge of the Cavite Mutiny was limited to a general understanding of its significance in the history of the Philippines.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A problem-solution pattern divides information into two main sections, one that describes a problem and one that describes a solution. This pattern is typically used in persuasive writing, where the writer's general purpose is to convince the reader to support a certain course of action. The pattern is designed to compel the reader to make some kind of change in opinion or behavior by establishing that a problem exists, then providing a solution. In the problem section, the writer identifies different aspects of the problem being discussed and offers evidence of these problems. In the solution section, the writer identifies a potential solution and supports the effectiveness of this solution over others.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>For example, suppose a writer's stated purpose is to persuade his/her readers to ride bicycles as their primary form of transportation. First the writer will attempt to establish that common forms of motorized transportation create compelling problems that require a solution. Then he/she will show how the proposed solution - riding bikes - provides a beneficial alternative to driving.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The diversity and richness of Philippine literature evolved side by side with the country’s history. This can best be appreciated in the context of the country’s pre-colonial cultural traditions and the socio-political histories of its colonial and contemporary traditions.        </p><p></p><p>       The average Filipino’s unfamiliarity with his indigenous literature was largely due to what has been impressed upon him: that his country was “discovered” and, hence, Philippine “history” started only in 1521.</p><p></p><p>       So successful were the efforts of colonialists to blot out the memory of the country’s largely oral past that present-day Filipino writers, artists and journalists are trying to correct this inequity by recognizing the country’s wealth of ethnic traditions and disseminating them in schools and in the mass media.</p><p></p><p>       The rousings of nationalistic pride in the 1960s and 1970s also helped bring about this change of attitude among a new breed of Filipinos concerned about the “Filipino identity.”</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
