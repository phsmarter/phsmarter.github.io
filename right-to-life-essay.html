                                            II. PERFORMANCE TASK. ESSAY The lesson tells us that solving right triangles means finding the measures of its missing parts. For us to completely describe the right triangles, one must find the measure of each of its sides and angles. The measures may not be that very exact, but we use defined formulas to find its estimated values. We can relate the concept of 'finding the missing parts of right triangles to one of the best quotations of Mr. Carl Jung, "Life calls, not for perfection, but completeness." What do you think are the things or qualities that may make a person's life complete? Write your answer (5-10 sentences) at the back of this paper.​</a>

                        Yan po ayaw kasi ma send<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>       Math is vital in our world today. Everyone uses mathematics in our day to day lives, and most of the time, we do not even realize it. Without math, our world would be missing a key component in its makeup.  Our world today would be lost without numbers. Without numbers people could not read clocks, measure anything, call anybody, and much more. Everybody has been put into a position where they were presented with different forms of data that must have been organized in order to make decisions pertaining to the situation.</p><p></p><p></p><p>        We use math everyday rather we know it or not. Math is so important in our lives. It is one of those subjects, whether we like it or not, that people will need for the rest of their lives. Without math, the world would be pure chaos. “Math is so important because it is such a huge part of our daily lives. Many people do not realize how much math they tend to encounter on a daily basis,” Miss Gilliland, math teacher at LPHS, said. One either likes math or dislikes it. One reason as to why students may hate math is because many of the concepts are abstract and can be hard to master. Variables, equations, and the dreaded story problems can all be difficult to figure out and understand, but everyone needs them to solve real life situations right now or for our future careers.</p><p></p><p>  </p><p>        Creating spending budgets, paying for groceries, buying things on sale, and cooking meals all have to deal with math in some way or another. One has to be able to measure out ingredients, count money, and determine limits when it comes to certain tasks like the examples above. People never realize how much math is around them until they take a step back and look.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>:)</strong></p><br />

(PhilHealth) is not only colossal thievery, robbing Filipino workers and taxpayers of their contributions to the fund. It also violates the right of Filipinos to universal health care, bleeding billions of pesos away from state resources intended for this purpose.

                            6. II. PERFORMANCE TASK. ESSAY The lesson tells us that solving right triangles means finding the measures of its missing parts. For us to completely describe the right triangles, one must find the measure of each of its sides and angles. The measures may not be that very exact, but we use defined formulas to find its estimated values. We can relate the concept of 'finding the missing parts of right triangles to one of the best quotations of Mr. Carl Jung, "Life calls, not for perfection, but completeness."

                        <p></p><p></p><p><strong>Good afternoon. I am writing to inform you that I have answered your question. Please find the response attached to this</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> In order to find the surface area of a solid, one must have the necessary dimensions. For example, if given the dimensions of a rectangular prism, one can find the surface area by using the formula <strong>2lw + 2lh + 2wh</strong>, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.</p><p></p><p>Another real-life situation that involves finding the surface area of a solid is determining the amount of paint needed to cover a square pyramid. To calculate the surface area of a square pyramid, one must have the length of the base and the slant height. The formula for finding the surface area of a square pyramid is <strong>2bs + b^2</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong>where b is the length of the base and s is the slant height.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, finding the surface area of a cylinder requires the radius and height of the cylinder. The formula for finding the surface area of a cylinder is <strong>2πr^2 + 2πrh,</strong> where r is the radius and h is the height. In real life, this could be used to determine the amount of wrapping paper needed to wrap a cylindrical gift.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, finding the surface area of a solid requires specific dimensions and the use of the appropriate formula. Whether dealing with a rectangular prism, square pyramid, cylinder, cone, or sphere, the process remains the same. By using the given dimensions, one can calculate the surface area and apply it to real-life situations.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>College is my first step to achieve my dream. Currently I am a student in high school. I do my best to keep my grades up, because I know that they will help me into college. I dream of going to UCSD to get a bachelors degree in biology, then coming back to Stockton to attend UOP and getting a Doctorates degree in Pharmacy. By the time I get this degree, I will be around 28, so I hope that it will all be worth it.             After I have a doctorate, I plan to get a job working for a company under their research division. I hope I can lend a hand in finding new, more effective ways of administering drugs to patents. Or I could possibly design self-administration drugs for those at home type of people. Or perhaps I could improve packaging designs for the medication. The possibilities are endless!             Outside of my job, I plan to buy a large home. I dream of settling down in an urban area, someplace that's not too big. A Stockton type of town, but not Stockton. Possibly Monterey or Carmel. Hopefully by the time I get a house, I'll have a wife and can start a family. I dream of having a son to carry on the family name.             As you can see, I have big plans for my future. I plan to make something of myself, and not to give up. I have a major fear of failure, and I won't let it get to me. My parents expect a lot out of me, and I think I have done a good job so far. My dreams are what keep me going; they are an object for me to strive for. I will obtain that object one day.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>SANA MAKATULONG</p><p>PA BRAINLIEST PO</p><p>PWEDE POBA KAHIT BIOLOGY??</p><br />
