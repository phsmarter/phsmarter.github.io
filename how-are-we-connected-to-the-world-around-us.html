                                            The Russia - Ukraine War
Read the article below and answer the following questions by expressing your own opinion.
1. What lesson/s can we derive from this war?
2. Write down the thesis statement of this article
 The war in Ukraine is unlike any war that’s been. Although it seems local, this war is changing the world. In the end, after all the pain, the parties will establish new relationships, and new relationships will be established around the world. This war is the beginning of a formation of a new world order, where all parties unite against the one common enemy of all of humanity: egoism. It will take time, but everyone involved will realize, and the whole world with them, that they are not fighting against each other, but against an enemy within them. If we let the idea sink in, even a bit, it will make it happen even sooner.
The war that began in late February will not end soon. It will take many more months until everyone realizes that war itself, the very concept of it, is evil. In that sense, the war in eastern Europe is correcting all of humanity, transforming our perception and our understanding of good and evil.
The casualties, the injured, and the lost property are a terrible price to pay. Nevertheless, global processes always come at a cost. We should not blame others for the cost, and we should not think that there is nothing each of us can do to change the world. It is in the hands of every person to change the world for the better, and to make the atrocities of war, and all atrocities that humans are inflicting on each other, disappear. All we need is to realize that the only enemy lies within us—our self-centered attitude. It incites us against each other, demonizes and vilifies anyone who disagrees with us, tells us that we are the only ones entitled in this world, and thereby sets us off against each other. We are all like that, infected with a pandemic of narcissism.
Nevertheless, there is a lot we can do to change the world. First, we must accept that there is a good reason we are so different from each other. Each of us makes a unique contribution to the world that no one else can. If we were all the same, the contributions we receive from others, and on which our lives depend, would be absent, and we would not survive, in the most physical sense of the word.
We will realize that our ego is the enemy only when we realize that singularity is the wrong key word for happiness. Today, the key word for happiness is complementarity—mutual satisfaction of each other’s material, social, emotional, and spiritual needs.
We are living in a world where we are all dependent on each other. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the appliances and gadgets that we use are all made by people we do not know, in places we do not know, and reach us in ways we do not know. But were it not for this chain of myriad unknown individuals, we would not survive, since we cannot provide for our needs by ourselves.
The same goes for social ties. All our connections, communications, and interactions with other people are made possible with the help of countless people who serve us without our awareness. But were it not for them, we would not be able to work or socialize.
Despite this obvious fact, we behave toward others with as little consideration as possible, and when we are nice or considerate, it is because we have an ulterior, selfish motive. We do not have the prerogative to keep up this behavior. We are destroying the world and destroying ourselves.
Back in the 1930s, Baal HaSulam, a great thinker and a great kabbalist, wrote an epic essay titled “Peace in the World.” In it, he writes, “Man is inherently born to lead a social life. Each and every individual in society is like a wheel that is linked to several other wheels placed in a machine.” How odd it is that ninety years ago, before World War II, people already realized that we are all dependent on each other and must behave toward each other with consideration. Just think what we could have avoided had we been more attentive and open-minded.
Now, too, we are headed for a catastrophe unless we pay attention and begin to act like one entity, one global society that works like a single, united family. The war will change the world, but I hope we can change ourselves before the war changes us.

Bowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilience are again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one is exempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently, Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy, but also on a lighter note, it came as a great global equalizer. This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and several universal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary. Our life, our wealth and all possessions we have, including our own skills and knowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even the most powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything is unpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation, we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go and our social connections and interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations and all things we hold dearly, with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftly becomes volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA world where all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change. And the very question is, 'Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on the government, family and friends for help? As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More than ever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faith to a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps us going and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and huge changes in this "new normal". We all are caught ofl-guard, but with our faith, we continue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive at all times. We learn how to look at the brighter side of life and choose to be optimistic amid the negativity around. Hence, our faith spells the big difference in facing all forms of life's challenges. Therefore, let us hold onto our faith strongly and dearly for as long as we believe we will never tremble nor fear the unseen. Remember, God is greatest and strongest above all forms of viruses such as this COVID-19.​</a>

                                            Pandemic: A Message of HopeWe slept in one world, and we woke up in other. Suddenly we realized thatParis is no linger romantic, Disney has no more magic, and in New York, everyonesleeps. Hugs and kisses became weapons, and not visiting parents and grandparentsbecame an act of love,Suddenly we realized that money is not that powerful, and power is not thatvaluable. Why is everything so uncertain in this world? I do not know. No one willever know, but I do know one thing that we do not need to focus on the uncertainties.Enjoy our life when we have one.The situation has taught us that everything our lives used to revolve aroundis so temporary. Work, ayms, malls, and movies have all gone for a toss as we arefinally learning to live without them. It has taught us that it's our own home andfamily that keeps us safe. We finally learned the fact that it's not how we spent ourtime, but who we spent it with. But I wonder, are we still walking by the things wecherish the most? We used to be consumed in our everyday lives that we were neverreally grateful for what we had, but now that we have received the harshest ofreminders, we don't need to keep running anymore. We can finally look withinourselves and connect with our soul. It's like the universe is giving us the opportunityto heal.Now, I do not know when this will end. No one does, but I do know one thingthat it will end one day, and that day we will all look back at what we've gone through,learned, and survived. We saw humanity at its best, and how it brought us alltogether like never before. I know it can be extremely hard for anyone to be positiveor optimistic right now, but we still have a choice. We can either spread fear or bethe light in the darkness that everyone wants to see.If you still cannot find something to hold onto, take a mirror, stand a littlelonger, and stare a little harder. You will find something deep inside of you that stillhas hope, faith, and human spirit in these times of disruption, tragedy, and chaos.Questions;1.Which parts of that motivational speech (sentences or paragraphs) you have given more emphasis when you delivered it?2. How did you give emphasis on those parts?  why?3. Were you able to effectively deliver the speech verbally (tone,volume,and speed of voices, filters, pauses, and pronounciation)?4. Were you able to effectively deliver the speech non-verbally (body movements, facial expressions, eye contacts, gestures, posture, and mastery)?5.

The Boy Who Cried Wolf Once upon a time, there lived a shepherd boy who was bored watching his flock of sheep on the hill. To amuse himself, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The sheep are being chased by the wolf!" The villagers came running to help the boy and save the sheep. They found nothing and the boy just laughed looking at their angry faces. "Don't cry wolf when there's no wolf boy!", they said angrily and left. The boy just laughed at them. After a while, he got bored and cried wolf!' again, fooling the villagers a second time. The angry villagers warned the boy a second time and left. The boy continued watching the flock. After a while, he saw a real wolf and cried loudly, "Wolf! Please help! The wolf is chasing the sheep. Help!" But this time, no one turned up to help. By evening, when the boy did not return home, the villagers wondered what happened to him and went up the hill. The boy sat on the hill weeping. "Why didn't you come when I called out that there was a wolf?" he asked angrily. "The flock is scattered now", he said. An old villager approached him and said, "People won't believe liars even when they tell the truth. We will look for your sheep tomorrow morning. Let's go home now".Need na Tom non-sence report​</a>

                                            translate in tagalog worst case scenario: zombie apocalypse. how will you survive? you might be surprised to find out how much geography skills can help you fend off doom. By geography. I mean analyzing the world around you. One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</a>

Ogeinam Bowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilience are again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one is exempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently. Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy; but also on a lighter note, it came as a great global equalizer. This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and several universal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary. Our life, our wealth and all possessions we have, including our own skills and knowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even the most powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything is unpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation, we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go and our social connections and interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations and all things we hold dearly, with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftly becomes volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA world where all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change. And the very question is, "Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on the government, family and friends for help? As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More than ever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faith to a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps us going and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and huge changes in this "new normal". We all are caught off-guard, but with our faith, we continue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive at all times. We learn how to look at the brighter side of life and choose to be optimistic amid the negativity around. Hence, our faith spells the big difference in facing all forms of life's challenges. Therefore, let us hold onto our faith strongly and dearly for as long as we believe we will never tremble nor fear the unseen. Remember, God is greatest and strongest above all forms of viruses such as this COVID-19.​</a>

We communicate because we wantto be heard and be understood. We also communicate because we want to express ourfeelings, and exchange ideas and opinions. Communication also helps people in bridgingthe gaps and in resolving issues and misunderstandingsThere are so many ways of communication Even before the pre-historic period,people have their way of communicating with each other. Some people communicateverbally through a face to face conversation, others also use the aidof technology through the use of a telephone or a video call via skype, zoom, andother applications. On the other hand, some people choose a different way tocommunicate that is through writingThe most common types of communication are verbal and writtencommunication.

                                            Pandemic: A Message of Hope We slept in one world, and we woke up in other. Suddenly we realized that Paris is no linger romantic, Disney has no more magic, and in New York, everyone sleeps. Hugs and kisses became weapons, and not visiting parents and grandparents became an act of love, Suddenly we realized that money is not that powerful, and power is not that valuable. Why is everything so uncertain in this world? I do not know. No one will ever know, but I do know one thing that we do not need to focus on the uncertainties. Enjoy our life when we have one. The situation has taught us that everything our lives used to revolve around is so temporary. Work, ayms, malls, and movies have all gone for a toss as we are finally learning to live without them. It has taught us that it's our own home and family that keeps us safe. We finally learned the fact that it's not how we spent our time, but who we spent it with. But I wonder, are we still walking by the things we cherish the most? We used to be consumed in our everyday lives that we were never really grateful for what we had, but now that we have received the harshest of reminders, we don't need to keep running anymore. We can finally look within ourselves and connect with our soul. It's like the universe is giving us the opportunity to heal. Now, I do not know when this will end. No one does, but I do know one thing that it will end one day, and that day we will all look back at what we've gone through, learned, and survived. We saw humanity at its best, and how it brought us all together like never before. I know it can be extremely hard for anyone to be positive or optimistic right now, but we still have a choice. We can either spread fear or be the light in the darkness that everyone wants to see. If you still cannot find something to hold onto, take a mirror, stand a little longer, and stare a little harder. You will find something deep inside of you that still has hope, faith, and human spirit in these times of disruption, tragedy, and chaos.

                            2. The Russia - Ukraine War
Read the article below and answer the following questions by expressing your own opinion.
1. What lesson/s can we derive from this war?
2. Write down the thesis statement of this article
 The war in Ukraine is unlike any war that’s been. Although it seems local, this war is changing the world. In the end, after all the pain, the parties will establish new relationships, and new relationships will be established around the world. This war is the beginning of a formation of a new world order, where all parties unite against the one common enemy of all of humanity: egoism. It will take time, but everyone involved will realize, and the whole world with them, that they are not fighting against each other, but against an enemy within them. If we let the idea sink in, even a bit, it will make it happen even sooner.
The war that began in late February will not end soon. It will take many more months until everyone realizes that war itself, the very concept of it, is evil. In that sense, the war in eastern Europe is correcting all of humanity, transforming our perception and our understanding of good and evil.
The casualties, the injured, and the lost property are a terrible price to pay. Nevertheless, global processes always come at a cost. We should not blame others for the cost, and we should not think that there is nothing each of us can do to change the world. It is in the hands of every person to change the world for the better, and to make the atrocities of war, and all atrocities that humans are inflicting on each other, disappear. All we need is to realize that the only enemy lies within us—our self-centered attitude. It incites us against each other, demonizes and vilifies anyone who disagrees with us, tells us that we are the only ones entitled in this world, and thereby sets us off against each other. We are all like that, infected with a pandemic of narcissism.
Nevertheless, there is a lot we can do to change the world. First, we must accept that there is a good reason we are so different from each other. Each of us makes a unique contribution to the world that no one else can. If we were all the same, the contributions we receive from others, and on which our lives depend, would be absent, and we would not survive, in the most physical sense of the word.
We will realize that our ego is the enemy only when we realize that singularity is the wrong key word for happiness. Today, the key word for happiness is complementarity—mutual satisfaction of each other’s material, social, emotional, and spiritual needs.
We are living in a world where we are all dependent on each other. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the appliances and gadgets that we use are all made by people we do not know, in places we do not know, and reach us in ways we do not know. But were it not for this chain of myriad unknown individuals, we would not survive, since we cannot provide for our needs by ourselves.
The same goes for social ties. All our connections, communications, and interactions with other people are made possible with the help of countless people who serve us without our awareness. But were it not for them, we would not be able to work or socialize.
Despite this obvious fact, we behave toward others with as little consideration as possible, and when we are nice or considerate, it is because we have an ulterior, selfish motive. We do not have the prerogative to keep up this behavior. We are destroying the world and destroying ourselves.
Back in the 1930s, Baal HaSulam, a great thinker and a great kabbalist, wrote an epic essay titled “Peace in the World.” In it, he writes, “Man is inherently born to lead a social life. Each and every individual in society is like a wheel that is linked to several other wheels placed in a machine.” How odd it is that ninety years ago, before World War II, people already realized that we are all dependent on each other and must behave toward each other with consideration. Just think what we could have avoided had we been more attentive and open-minded.
Now, too, we are headed for a catastrophe unless we pay attention and begin to act like one entity, one global society that works like a single, united family. The war will change the world, but I hope we can change ourselves before the war changes us.

Bowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilience are again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one is exempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently, Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy, but also on a lighter note, it came as a great global equalizer. This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and several universal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary. Our life, our wealth and all possessions we have, including our own skills and knowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even the most powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything is unpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation, we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go and our social connections and interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations and all things we hold dearly, with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftly becomes volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA world where all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change. And the very question is, 'Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on the government, family and friends for help? As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More than ever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faith to a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps us going and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and huge changes in this "new normal". We all are caught ofl-guard, but with our faith, we continue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive at all times. We learn how to look at the brighter side of life and choose to be optimistic amid the negativity around. Hence, our faith spells the big difference in facing all forms of life's challenges. Therefore, let us hold onto our faith strongly and dearly for as long as we believe we will never tremble nor fear the unseen. Remember, God is greatest and strongest above all forms of viruses such as this COVID-19.​</h2><br />

                            5. Pandemic: A Message of HopeWe slept in one world, and we woke up in other. Suddenly we realized thatParis is no linger romantic, Disney has no more magic, and in New York, everyonesleeps. Hugs and kisses became weapons, and not visiting parents and grandparentsbecame an act of love,Suddenly we realized that money is not that powerful, and power is not thatvaluable. Why is everything so uncertain in this world? I do not know. No one willever know, but I do know one thing that we do not need to focus on the uncertainties.Enjoy our life when we have one.The situation has taught us that everything our lives used to revolve aroundis so temporary. Work, ayms, malls, and movies have all gone for a toss as we arefinally learning to live without them. It has taught us that it's our own home andfamily that keeps us safe. We finally learned the fact that it's not how we spent ourtime, but who we spent it with. But I wonder, are we still walking by the things wecherish the most? We used to be consumed in our everyday lives that we were neverreally grateful for what we had, but now that we have received the harshest ofreminders, we don't need to keep running anymore. We can finally look withinourselves and connect with our soul. It's like the universe is giving us the opportunityto heal.Now, I do not know when this will end. No one does, but I do know one thingthat it will end one day, and that day we will all look back at what we've gone through,learned, and survived. We saw humanity at its best, and how it brought us alltogether like never before. I know it can be extremely hard for anyone to be positiveor optimistic right now, but we still have a choice. We can either spread fear or bethe light in the darkness that everyone wants to see.If you still cannot find something to hold onto, take a mirror, stand a littlelonger, and stare a little harder. You will find something deep inside of you that stillhas hope, faith, and human spirit in these times of disruption, tragedy, and chaos.Questions;1.Which parts of that motivational speech (sentences or paragraphs) you have given more emphasis when you delivered it?2.

The Boy Who Cried Wolf Once upon a time, there lived a shepherd boy who was bored watching his flock of sheep on the hill. To amuse himself, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The sheep are being chased by the wolf!" The villagers came running to help the boy and save the sheep. They found nothing and the boy just laughed looking at their angry faces. "Don't cry wolf when there's no wolf boy!", they said angrily and left. The boy just laughed at them. After a while, he got bored and cried wolf!' again, fooling the villagers a second time. The angry villagers warned the boy a second time and left. The boy continued watching the flock. After a while, he saw a real wolf and cried loudly, "Wolf! Please help! The wolf is chasing the sheep. Help!" But this time, no one turned up to help. By evening, when the boy did not return home, the villagers wondered what happened to him and went up the hill. The boy sat on the hill weeping. "Why didn't you come when I called out that there was a wolf?" he asked angrily. "The flock is scattered now", he said. An old villager approached him and said, "People won't believe liars even when they tell the truth. We will look for your sheep tomorrow morning. Let's go home now".Need na Tom non-sence report​</h2><br />

One geographic concept that could really help you out in a zombie apolypse is movement. so, first what moves ? people move , animals move , and while sometimes slowly, zombie move as well but that,s not all. good move too. goods can be resources, such as food supplies and weapons. people or zombies tend to move these so, if you see a big pile of zombie supplies where therewasn't one before you're probably on the trail. ideas also move. ideas can include entertaiment , zombies and information news and information about zombie attacks and architecture, or how to build a safe shelter. and, second, why do people or zombies move? when people, animals, or zombies move, its called migration two concepts that affect migration are push and pull factors. push factors will make you want to leave some where. pull factors make you want to go to a place. a lack of resources, unstable economy. or high crime rate might be push factors making people want to move. nice wheather a good economy, or lots of resources would be pull factors for lots of people enticing them to move while zombies are definitely a push factor for humans a city full of people would be a pull factor for hungry zombies who want to eat humans. there are somethings that make movement easier for people or zombies waterways and high ways can tough terrain. and just as land forms can create boundaries that affect movement, so can political boundaries , like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors like a border gate for example. so how can you analyze these movement factors to help your change of survival? There are three basic steps. one identify the pionts or locations to analyze. what are your options? two find what connects them. Are there high ways. or openland? and three find the patterns of movement thatconnection. Do people or goods move across? by comparing relationships between different places, you can see what connections they have. for example. pick two cities. For example, pick two cities look at the highway connecting them. if people use that highway to commute to work, those cities have a strong relationship. but this city over here doesn't have a direct connection to the other cities. there's even a river in the way. it doesn't have as strong of a relationship. if a zombie out break started here, which cith would you rather start out in? where would you feel to? so , how do yoy decide where togo in a zombie apolypse? Do you just in a ramdom directed ? or do you use you geagraphic skills to lead your camp of survivor to safety ? if you want stay a live. it helps to understand how and why we move.​</h2><br />

Ogeinam Bowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilience are again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one is exempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently. Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy; but also on a lighter note, it came as a great global equalizer. This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and several universal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary. Our life, our wealth and all possessions we have, including our own skills and knowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even the most powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything is unpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation, we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go and our social connections and interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations and all things we hold dearly, with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftly becomes volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA world where all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change. And the very question is, "Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on the government, family and friends for help? As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More than ever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faith to a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps us going and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and huge changes in this "new normal". We all are caught off-guard, but with our faith, we continue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive at all times. We learn how to look at the brighter side of life and choose to be optimistic amid the negativity around. Hence, our faith spells the big difference in facing all forms of life's challenges. Therefore, let us hold onto our faith strongly and dearly for as long as we believe we will never tremble nor fear the unseen. Remember, God is greatest and strongest above all forms of viruses such as this COVID-19.​</h2><br />

Even irrational beings have their way of communicating with each otherSince there are so many people in the world to communicate with, we need tocommunicate efficientlyCommunication is one way of sharing knowledge and information with otherpeople. It brings people closer together. It also helps people to build and develop arelationship with other people and get connected around the world,What is the importance of communication? We communicate because we wantto be heard and be understood. We also communicate because we want to express ourfeelings, and exchange ideas and opinions. Communication also helps people in bridgingthe gaps and in resolving issues and misunderstandingsThere are so many ways of communication Even before the pre-historic period,people have their way of communicating with each other. Some people communicateverbally through a face to face conversation, others also use the aidof technology through the use of a telephone or a video call via skype, zoom, andother applications. On the other hand, some people choose a different way tocommunicate that is through writingThe most common types of communication are verbal and writtencommunication. These types of communication were made easy nowadays with the riseof the internet. You can do and get everything that you want. You can do onlinemarketing and business transactions. You can also look for online jobs, and even doonline hunting for lifetime partners through social media sitesNow that we are facing one of the world's most viral phenomena, the Covid 19pandemic, communication in whatever platform has an impact on bringing people closertogether, on delivering quality education, and most importantly, in continuing our livesAnswer the following questions1.

                            13. Pandemic: A Message of Hope We slept in one world, and we woke up in other. Suddenly we realized that Paris is no linger romantic, Disney has no more magic, and in New York, everyone sleeps. Hugs and kisses became weapons, and not visiting parents and grandparents became an act of love, Suddenly we realized that money is not that powerful, and power is not that valuable. Why is everything so uncertain in this world? I do not know. No one will ever know, but I do know one thing that we do not need to focus on the uncertainties. Enjoy our life when we have one. The situation has taught us that everything our lives used to revolve around is so temporary. Work, ayms, malls, and movies have all gone for a toss as we are finally learning to live without them. It has taught us that it's our own home and family that keeps us safe. We finally learned the fact that it's not how we spent our time, but who we spent it with. But I wonder, are we still walking by the things we cherish the most? We used to be consumed in our everyday lives that we were never really grateful for what we had, but now that we have received the harshest of reminders, we don't need to keep running anymore. We can finally look within ourselves and connect with our soul. It's like the universe is giving us the opportunity to heal. Now, I do not know when this will end. No one does, but I do know one thing that it will end one day, and that day we will all look back at what we've gone through, learned, and survived. We saw humanity at its best, and how it brought us all together like never before. I know it can be extremely hard for anyone to be positive or optimistic right now, but we still have a choice. We can either spread fear or be the light in the darkness that everyone wants to see. If you still cannot find something to hold onto, take a mirror, stand a little longer, and stare a little harder. You will find something deep inside of you that still has hope, faith, and human spirit in these times of disruption, tragedy, and chaos.
