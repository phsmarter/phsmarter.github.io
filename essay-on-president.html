                        <p>Essay : What President that i wish to have</p><p></p><p>With the presidential election only one short month away, it’s important to know what makes a good leader. When choosing our president, not only should we look at their politics, but we should also look at their character. The certain qualities a person possesses can potentially determine what kind of leader they will be. I believe that a good leader possesses the qualities of dependability, integrity and perseverance. Without these qualities, I don’t see how any person can lead and direct a group, or in this case, a whole nation.</p><p></p><p>One of the single most important aspects of a good leader is dependability. To be a leader means you have a lot of responsibilities, so people have to depend on you to take care these responsibilities. Sometimes, being a leader comes with hard decisions, but it’s your responsibility to make those decisions. If people can depend on you to get them through not only the good times, but the hard ones too, then you have the making of a great leader.</p><p></p><p>Another important quality of being a great leader is integrity. The possession of firm principals ensures that you will make the most responsible decisions and do what you truly think is best. Having integrity means a person is honest, trustworthy, reliable, loyal and honorable. To be a leader you must possess these certain characteristics so that you are able to lead fairly and justly. Without integrity and a good set of core values, how can we be able to trust our leaders.</p><p></p><p>The last, but not least, essential quality of a good leader is perseverance. With determination and perseverance, we can know that our leader will keep focused and get us through difficult times. To be determined is one of the most important aspects of a leader so perseverance to do your best and lead the people in the right direction is crucial. Without motivation, a leader can fold under the pressures of the job and let down the people. Perseverance ensures that the job done and the people will be led properly.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:<br /><br />There are many different qualities people believe a president should have. These qualities make up whether a president was considered a good leader...or a mediocre one. In my opinion, a good president should be open to listening to their citizens and have the appropriate qualifications. If a president listens to their citizens, that means that they are intimate with the knowledge of the country's economic status, how its citizens feel, and what appropriate actions should be taken. Along with that, since a president is in charge of many things (the military, the economy, etc), I believe that a good president should actually know what they are doing, and whether it will be good for the overall well-being of their country and citizens.</strong></p><br />

                            19. persuasive essay about anti bullying if your are a president of the philippines?</h2><br />
                        <br />We are living in a world where some people think that violence is the only reason to solve every problem.  If people keep this violence around us, it’s not going to get better. Violence has been in this world for centuries now and for the same causes, to gain power of authority. Kids in schools feel superior to others by calling other kids horrible names and making fun of them. Men hit women so they can “earn” their respect back. The point is that violence won’t make you a better person, it will make you a monster and nobody likes a monster.<br /><br />There are many different kinds of violence. One of them is called bullying. The victims of this violence are mostly kids and teenagers around the ages of 10-18. Bullying is when someone says mean things to someone in person or in a social network. Most of the time it happens in the social network because kids thing that by making fun of someone in a social network area, they won’t get in trouble by an adult. This is one of the worst violence in the world because is between kids and teenagers. Most of the teenagers today have very low self-esteem because of the media. They haven’t still found what they want to do with their lives, so, by saying mean things to them, it won’t help them be successful since they think that what they are saying is true.<br /><br />There are over 3.2 million of students that are victims of bullying each year. Because of these, approximately 160,000 teens skip school every day to avoid the bullies. Some of these students drop out of school. Some schools don’t even help the victims that are been bullied. Over two-thirds of students believe that schools respond poorly to bullying, with high percentage of students believing that adult help is infrequent and ineffective. I didn’t know that harassment and bullying has been linked to 75 percent of school-shooting incidents.<br /><br />There have been many cases of suicide because of bullying. One of the recent ones was the suicide of Amanda Todd. She committed suicide on October 10, 2012 at her home in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada.  She was 16 years old when she died. On September 7, 2012, she posted a 9-minute video on YouTube titled My Story: Struggling, bullying, suicide and self-harm, which showed her using flash cards telling her experiences being bullied.  The reason she was bullied was because when she was in 7th grade, she used video chat to meet new people over the internet. People she met would always give her complements about her looks. A stranger convinced her to bare her breasts on camera. He later blackmailed her with threats to expose the topless photo to her friends unless she gave a “show”. The photo of her circulated the internet. She moved to different places to start fresh, but the individual would always disguise himself as a student coming new to school. She tried to kill herself by drinking bleach and an overdose of drugs, but it didn’t work. Students from her school would make fun of her because she failed in her suicide and in her grades. After the entire nightmare, on October 10, 2012 at about 6:00 PM, she was found hanged at her home.<br /><br />Like I said before, most of the teenagers have a very low self-esteem and by telling them mean things, they will only become worst. Everybody makes mistakes. Kids today are always in the internet and they meet strangers everyday. As a parent, you need to pay attention to everything that the kid is doing. If you don’t want to have problems like this, don’t talk to strangers over the internet. Once it’s on the internet it stays there forever.  If you see someone that is being bullied over the internet or at school, contact an adult or confront the person yourself. If we all stand up together against bullying, the world will be a better place. You might think that the one that you are making fun of is a monster because of the stuff he or she has done, but in reality, you are the monster for making them feel worst.<br /><br />Be the change of a good person dont wait for the time that everyone leaves you<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Title: The Presidency in the Philippines: A Nexus of Power and Public Sentiment</p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The presidency in the Philippines holds a pivotal position in the country's governance and represents the embodiment of executive authority. This essay delves into the role of the presidency, explores the people's relationship to it, and examines why presidential decisions can elicit strong reactions from the populace.</p><p></p><p>The Role of the Presidency:</p><p>The presidency in the Philippines is a position of immense power and responsibility. As the head of state and government, the president serves as the chief executive, responsible for executing and enforcing laws, directing the nation's policies, and representing the country both domestically and internationally. The president holds significant authority over various branches of government, including the executive, legislative, and judicial, ensuring the smooth functioning of the nation.</p><p></p><p>The People's Relationship to the Presidency:</p><p>The relationship between the people and the presidency in the Philippines is deeply intertwined, reflecting a mixture of respect, hope, and expectations. The president is viewed as the symbol of national unity, the embodiment of the people's aspirations and the hope for progress and stability. Elections play a vital role in shaping this relationship, with citizens actively participating in choosing their leader.</p><p></p><p>Presidential Decisions and Strong Reactions:</p><p>Presidential decisions in the Philippines often carry significant consequences, leading to strong reactions from the public. Several factors contribute to these reactions:</p><p></p><p>1. Impact on Daily Lives: Presidential decisions have a direct bearing on the lives of ordinary citizens. Policies related to economic development, infrastructure, healthcare, education, and social welfare can profoundly affect the well-being of individuals and communities. When decisions are perceived as beneficial, they can elicit support and admiration. Conversely, decisions that negatively impact the populace can provoke discontent, frustration, and anger.</p><p></p><p>2. Promised Reforms and Expectations: During electoral campaigns, presidential candidates often present comprehensive platforms and promise significant reforms to address pressing issues. When citizens elect a president based on these promises, they have high expectations for positive change. Consequently, when presidential decisions fail to meet these expectations or are seen as inadequate, it can lead to disappointment and disillusionment, triggering strong reactions.</p><p></p><p>3. Sociopolitical Divisions and Partisanship: The Philippines, like many nations, experiences political divisions and partisanship. Presidential decisions can exacerbate these divisions, as differing political ideologies and interests clash. Supporters and opponents of the president may vehemently react to decisions, leading to protests, rallies, and social unrest. Social media and other communication platforms amplify these reactions, making them more visible and influential.</p><p></p><p>4. Media and Public Discourse: The media plays a vital role in shaping public opinion and reactions to presidential decisions. News outlets, both traditional and digital, provide platforms for discussions, analysis, and critiques of presidential actions. Media narratives can influence public sentiment, either reinforcing or challenging presidential decisions, ultimately amplifying the public's response.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The presidency in the Philippines occupies a central role in the country's governance and holds significant power. The people's relationship with the presidency is complex, encompassing hopes, expectations, and the realities of everyday life. Presidential decisions have the potential to evoke strong reactions due to their impact on citizens' lives, unmet expectations, political divisions, and the role of media and public discourse. Understanding the dynamics between the presidency and the people provides insight into the complexities of governance in the Philippines and the interplay between leadership and public sentiment.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
