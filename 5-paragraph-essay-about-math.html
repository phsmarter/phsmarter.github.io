                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>            Adoption is one of the greatest ways for loving responsible couples to give unwanted youth a happy home. As the number of children in the care of foster homes and orphanges grow, adoption is a vital way for children from broken homes as well as potential parents with a stable environment to become connected. As these families are formed, not only is it important to learn new heritage, but also it is equally important for adoptive children to be informed of their biological heritage as well. Adoptive parents have an obligation to diclose all pertinent information to their adoptive children, to include the identity of their birth parents.</p><p>             As children grow and develop, the desire and curiosity for them to know their biological parents will also grow. Questions concerning the origin of their eye color, hair color and their looks in general almost always arise. Curiosity of where children develop certain natural talents and interest never seem to be fully answered without a good knowledge of biological lineage. This information is very important to every human being, including adoptive youth. No one should be denied the right to know everything that can be learned about themselves.</p><p>             As these adoptive children grow into mature and respectable adults, certain issues concerning health will usually begin to surface. Genetics play a big role in determining our physical and mental well-being. many preventable illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes and anxiey may all be avoided if certain risk factors are addressed early in the adoptive child's life. Without a detailed and adequate knowledge of family health history, many individuals are subject to making critical health decisions such as dieting and stress management which can eventually result in disease and illness.</p><p>             It is imperative for everyone, especially adoptive children, to know his/her family history.</p><p></p><p>                               Adoption</p><p>      One of the best methods for caring, responsible couples to provide unwanted children with a happy home is through adoption. Adoption is a crucial means of connecting children from broken homes and prospective parents with stable environments as the number of kids in foster care and orphanages rises. </p><p>       It is crucial for adoptive children to be aware of their biological heritage as these families are created, in addition to learning about new ancestry. Adoptive parents have a responsibility to disclose to their adopted children all relevant information, including who their biological parents are.</p><p>       Children's urge and curiosity to learn more about their biological parents will grow as they mature and develop. </p><p>       There are nearly always inquiries about the source of their eye color, hair color, and overall appearance. Without a thorough understanding of biological lineage, the question of how and why infants develop particular innate abilities and interests never seems to have an adequate solution. </p><p>         Every person, including adopted children, should be aware of this information. Nobody's right to learn everything there is to know about themselves should be denied. These adopted children will typically start to experience health problems as they progress and become respectable adults. </p><p>          </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>study well:))</p><p></p><br />

Everything has some purpose. Humans are the best creation, and each person is exclusive. Thus, writing about myself, I’m here to express myself that what I see, what I experience and what I plan for my life. I try myself to be modest, passionate, devoted, hardworking and honest.</p><p></p><p>My name is (insert your first name and surname here). I grew up as an only child. I am thirteen years old. My parents died while I was quite little, so I live with my grandparents.</p><p></p><p>Accustomed to living with older adults, I always act more mature than my age. I am in (mention your class and the name of your school). I have had a lot of people invest in me academically, so I have excelled in most of my classes. My hobbies include music, reading and traveling. Although I don’t get to travel much, I relish every moment I get to. I am generally pleased with my life.</p><p></p><p>I have always been treated like a baby, by my parents, siblings, teachers and basically everyone who is not in my age group. Sometimes even my friends talk to me like I am a child, which is why I basically love school and reading books. Books don’t talk back at you and they make me feel important in this gigantic universe.</p><p></p><p>This is not to say that I don’t love all the care and attention. I do, it’s just that sometimes it can get stifling. However, I am quite content with my life.</p><br />

                        Abortion, as we all know, has been used many times on innocent undevelop babies. One main reason why women would do such is first, because they aren't prepared to be a mother, second, because their partner left them and they got nothing else to supply the baby's basic needs and last one, is because they assume that the baby is a "mistake". But what they are missing is that even how many problems, trials and even "mistakes" they would make, that baby, even if you turn the world upside down, is life. It is another life. A blessing, and the joy to which you would experience upon seeing it.<br /><br />Yet why do some women or even young ladies abort such a beautiful thing? Lust is a word that can be interconnected with this matter. Some say the baby is "just a mistake" but actually the baby is not the mistake, rather, they are the ones. If they hadnt gone overboard and do things that they are still not ready yet, then why go with the flow with it? <br /><br />Carrying and delivering a baby is hard. All women know that. Experiencing pain, sorrows and everything. But after you have a life within you, why not keep it? Even if it's hard at first, at the end, all those pain and all those sufferings are worth it. Joy and laughter would definitely replaced those negative and bad emotions. You just need to endure it, ask advices too and most especially, when carrying it, fill that baby all the love you could give it. Don't just deliver and carry it for the sake of getting rid of the burden, cherish it because sooner or later, you will really regret.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Patriotism, also known as national pride, is a feeling of patriotism, loyalty, and commitment to one's homeland, as well as a bond with other people who share these feelings. In other words, patriotism entails prioritizing the country's interests over one's own. This idea helps in building the nation as stronger as it is. If most of the people in our country work for the collective interest and for betterwork, peace and harmony will be maintained. There is no conflict and struggle of independence as well. </p><p></p><p><strong>:</strong><strong>)</strong><strong>)</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Families are an integral part of one’s life. It does not matter if you have a small or big family, as long as you have one. A family serves as the first school to the child where one learns about various things. The basic knowledge about one’s culture and identity comes from their family only. In other words, you are a reflection of your family. All the good habits and manners one has incorporated are from their family only. I feel very lucky to be born in a family which has made me a better person. In my opinion, families are an essential part of one’s being. In this essay on my family, I will tell you why family is important.</p><p></p><p>Families are a blessing not everyone is fortunate enough to have. However, those who do, sometimes do not value this blessing. Some people spend time away from the family in order to become independent.</p><p></p><p>However, they do not realize its importance. Families are essential as they help in our growth. They develop us into becoming a complete person with an individual identity. Moreover, they give us a sense of security and a safe environment to flourish in.</p><p></p><p>We learn to socialize through our families only and develop our intellect. Studies show that people who live with their families tend to be happier than ones living alone. They act as your rock in times of trouble.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Abortion is a topic that has incites many people from all around the world. While most believe it is wrong to have abortion, some think that it is a need and an essential right to women and they should have access to it. For me, I completely agree with the people who think we should have abortion even though I believe that every woman should have the right to choose what happens to her body, including whether or not to terminate a pregnancy.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Denying women the right to abortion violates their basic human rights. Women should have the right to choose what they do with their bodies and should not be forced to carry a baby if they don't want to. There are numerous reasons why women needs to terminate a baby, including financial problems, health concerns, or simply being unfit to raise a child. It isn't right to force them to carry a baby from their condition, especially because it could harm their mental or physical health or even their ability to take care of themselves and their childrens.So i say that we keep abortion clinics open as if we don't it may violate their freedom and reproductive rights.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Without rules and regulations all civilization would plunge into chaos, as there would be nothing protecting us from one another’s most basic self serving instincts, and sometimes self-destructive habits. Often time’s simple rules and regulations protect us from ourselves, such as not touching a hot furnace or driving through an intersection when the light is red. If we look just at laws of the road one can quickly see how many devastating accidents would occur (and how many lives would be ruined) if no one followed the rules of the road. Without the utmost care to follow these rules, things that could easily be prevented may happen, resulting in very negative things.</p><p></p><p>In societies there has to be a guideline--something that regulates…show more content…</p><p>The difference between a law and a rule is that the law describes what the rule is in a negative way, meaning it does state the terms of the broken rule as on "sex with a minor" and describes a proscribed penalty the breaker of the rule has to expect.</p><p>Rules do establish a society: For example, Hammurabi, who to my knowledge formed the first society known, established the rule that "the strong shall carry the weak". It was a rule of significance, because this rule showed the responsibility of those who were strong. Without the rules we would be living in some sort of anarchy, a society where every one could just do what they wanted to without having to worry about consequences. Rules do establish a sense of accountability--to each other, to the neighbors, to the government--without rules we would only be a bunch of savages.</p><p></p><p>The law is important for a society for it serves as a norm of conduct for citizens. It was also made to provide for proper guidelines and order upon the behaviour for all citizens and to sustain the equity on the three branches of the government. It keeps the society running.</p><p></p><p>rules are important because they tend to protect the weaker class in the society as they might be disadvantaged if rules are broken. When rules are used in the right way they provide a stable environment and human co-existent in a country, which leads to peace and development.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Love is a universal human experience that has been explored through various mediums such as literature, art, music, and film. While love is often romanticized in popular culture, it is a complex emotion that can take on many forms and meanings. In this essay, I will explore the different dimensions of love and its impact on human relationships.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, love is often associated with romantic relationships between individuals. Romantic love is characterized by strong feelings of attachment, intimacy, and passion. It is the type of love that is typically portrayed in movies and romantic novels, and it is often seen as the ultimate goal in life. Romantic love can bring a sense of fulfillment and happiness, but it can also be accompanied by feelings of insecurity, jealousy, and heartbreak.</p><p></p><p>However, love is not limited to romantic relationships. Love can also be experienced through family bonds, friendships, and even a love for oneself. The love between family members is often unconditional and enduring, while friendships can provide a sense of companionship, trust, and support. Loving oneself is also crucial to one's mental and emotional well-being, as it promotes self-acceptance and self-care.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, love can have a significant impact on one's physical and mental health. Studies have shown that individuals in loving relationships experience lower levels of stress, improved immune function, and a longer lifespan. The positive effects of love on one's health extend beyond romantic relationships and can be observed in strong social connections, such as those formed through family and friendships.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, love is a multifaceted emotion that plays an integral role in human relationships and well-being. While romantic love is often romanticized in popular culture, it is essential to recognize the many forms of love that exist, including familial, platonic, and self-love. The positive impact of love on one's health and happiness cannot be overlooked, making it an essential aspect of human life.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliests Naman kapalit Ng sagot haha salamat </p><br />

Transportation Choices.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Transportation choices are a crucial part of everyday life. They impact the environment, traffic congestion, and our personal budgets. Some popular transportation choices include personal vehicles, public transit, cycling, and walking. Each choice has its benefits and drawbacks.</p><p></p><p>Personal vehicles, such as cars and motorcycles, offer convenience and flexibility. They allow individuals to travel where and when they want, without being bound by a specific schedule. However, personal vehicles also contribute to pollution and traffic congestion, making them less environmentally friendly than other options.</p><p></p><p>Public transit, such as buses and trains, offers a more sustainable and affordable option. It reduces traffic congestion and air pollution by allowing multiple people to travel together. However, it may have limited schedules and routes, and can be less convenient than personal vehicles.</p><p></p><p>Cycling and walking are also excellent choices for short distances. They offer numerous health benefits, including exercise and fresh air. They also have no environmental impact, making them the most sustainable options. However, they may not be feasible for longer distances or during adverse weather conditions. Overall, choosing the right transportation option depends on various factors, including convenience, cost, and environmental impact.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Paragraph 1: </p><p>Transportation choices are an important part of our lives. We have a variety of options available to us, from walking and biking to public transportation and cars. Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it’s important to consider which one is best for your needs. Walking and biking are great for short distances, as they don’t require any fuel or money. However, they can be time consuming if you need to travel far. </p><p></p><p>Paragraph 2: </p><p>Public transportation is often the most cost-effective way to get around in cities or towns with good public transit systems. Buses, trains, subways, and other forms of mass transit can help you get where you need to go quickly and cheaply. However, these services may not be available in all areas or at all times of day. Additionally, some people may feel uncomfortable using public transportation due to safety concerns or lack of accessibility options such as elevators or ramps for wheelchairs users. </p><p></p><p>Paragraph 3: </p><p>Cars are the most common form of transportation in many parts of the world today due to their convenience and flexibility when it comes to getting around quickly over long distances. Cars also provide more privacy than other forms of transport since you don’t have to share them with strangers like on buses or trains. However, cars require fuel which can be expensive depending on how much you drive; they also produce emissions that contribute significantly towards air pollution levels in cities worldwide</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of rates of change and accumulation. It has two main branches: differential calculus, which deals with the study of how quantities change, and integral calculus, which deals with the study of how quantities accumulate. Calculus is used in a wide range of fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and computer science.</p><p>One of the most important concepts in calculus is the derivative, which is a measure of how a function is changing at a particular point. The derivative can be used to find the maximum or minimum values of a function, as well as to study the behavior of a function near a specific point. This concept is essential in fields like physics and engineering, where it is used to analyze the motion of objects and the strength of structures.</p><p>Integral calculus, on the other hand, deals with the accumulation of quantities, and it is used to calculate the area under a curve or the total change in a variable over a given interval. This concept is particularly useful in fields such as economics, where it is used to calculate the total cost or revenue of a certain process. It is also used to calculate the total distance traveled by an object or the total work done by a force. Understanding the concepts of both differential and integral calculus is essential for a wide range of applications and fields.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Climate change refers to the long-term alteration of global temperatures, precipitation patterns, and sea levels due to human activities. The scientific consensus is that climate change is primarily caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. These emissions come from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, among others. The impacts of climate change are already being felt around the world, including more frequent extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and changes in ecosystems and agriculture.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, climate change is a scientifically proven phenomenon, and the overwhelming evidence supports the claim that human activities are the primary cause. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has published numerous reports summarizing the scientific consensus on climate change, including the physical science basis, impacts, and mitigation measures. Furthermore, independent research from various fields, including meteorology, oceanography, and geology, has confirmed the reality of climate change.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the impacts of climate change are severe and wide-ranging, and they pose significant risks to human societies and ecosystems. Climate change is leading to more frequent heatwaves, droughts, floods, and storms, which threaten public health, infrastructure, and food security. Sea-level rise is causing coastal erosion and flooding, which will affect millions of people living in low-lying areas. Moreover, climate change is already causing irreversible changes in ecosystems, such as coral reef bleaching and the melting of Arctic sea ice.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, addressing climate change requires urgent and collective action from individuals, governments, and businesses. The Paris Agreement, signed by 196 countries in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with a goal of 1.5°C. Achieving this target requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions rapidly, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and implementing adaptation measures to cope with the impacts of climate change. While progress has been made, more needs to be done to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Cybercrime</strong></p><p>Cybercrime, often known as computer crime, is the use of a computer to advance illicit activities including fraud, the trafficking of child po-rnography and other intellectual property, identity theft, and privacy viol4tions. The relevance of cybercrime, particul4rly over the Internet, has increased as the computer has taken center stage in business, entertainment, and government. The majority of the first victims and bad guys of cybercrime were Americans due to the country's early and mass use of computers and the Internet. But by the 21st century, there was scarcely a hamIet left on the pl4net that had not been affected in some way by cybercrime.</p><p>Despite few new sorts of crime, modern technology open up new criminal chances. What separ4tes cybercrime from more conventional criminal behavior? The use of digital computers is undoubtedly one difference, but it is not sufficient to draw distinctions between other types of criminal conduct. Criminals may conduct fraud, traffic in child po-rn and stolen goods, steal identities, and viol4te people's privacy without the need of a computer. All of those activities were present prior to the ubiquity of the "cyber" prefix. Cybercrime, particul4rly when it involves the Internet, is both a continuation of previously unl4wful behavior and the introduction of certain new illegal behaviors.</p><p>The majority of cybercrime consists of an attack on data pertaining to people, businesses, or governments. Although the physical body is not the target of the attacks, it is the collection of data characteristics that distinguish individuals and organizations on the Internet, known as the personal or corporate virtual body. To put it another way, our virtual identities are crucial components of daily life in the digital era. We are a collection of numbers and IDs in numerous computer databases that are contr0lled by both governments and businesses. The prevalence of networked computers in our lives and the brittleness of concepts like personal identity are both brought home by cybercrime.</p><p>Cyberspace is essentially a more developed version of the location where a telephone call takes pl4ce, which is in-between the two parties. The Internet provides thieves with several hiding spots both within and outside the network itself because it is a network that spans the whole pl4net. </p><p>However, despite their best attempts to hide their traces, cybercriminals leave indications as to their identity and whereabouts, much as people walking on the ground leave markings that a good tracker can follow. International cybercrime conventions need to be adopted, nevertheless, in order to pursue such signals across international borders.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about cybercrime: brainly.ph/question/22950998</p><p>#SPJ2</p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
