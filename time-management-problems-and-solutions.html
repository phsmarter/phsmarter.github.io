                                            Several students receive poor grades on writing assignments, not because they lack the ability to communicate, but because they can not seem to manage their time when it comes to a large project. They do not know where to begin, and therefore put things off until the last minute. To solve this problem, students need to develop a tineline for completing the project. If they divide the assignment into manageable "chunks" or parts and then set a schedule for completing each part, they will be able to finish the entire project before the deadline​1.Problem*Solution*Solution*SolutionNonsense=ReportRight Answer=Brainliset and heart</a>

                                            You are recently promoted as the chief traffic management officer of a major city in the country. Based on recent data, you learned that one of the leading causes of road accidents is over speeding. In your desire to minimize road accidents, you went out to observe how traffic management rules are implemented on the streets. Your attention was caught by a fast - moving car that seemed to be breaking the speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour(km/hr.), and so you followed it along the highway. After a short time, the driver of the car noticed you and started to slow down. Eventually, he stopped on the side of the road. Supposed the speed of the car had been noted during this time and is modeled by the quadratic equation y = 3x² + 17x - 20, where y represents the speed of the car in km/hr. and x represents the number of minutes after you started following the car. How long did it take for the car to be under surveillance before it could finally stop on the side of the road? Did the driver of the car really break the speed limit of 100 km/hr.? Explain.

                                            Business problem solution
There's nothing undoubtedly just like the excitement of maintaining your own business. But it also affects many challenges you demand to know and be prepared to manage.
Here are some simple little business problems or suggestions for a way to affect them.
Lacking Capital Flow
Through far the foremost important hurdle faced by start-ups and other tiny enterprises is money. Too multiple times, entrepreneurs don't start out with fairly capital. Start-up expenses often exceed the budget. When starting out, get multiple proposals for large-ticket items and always found out a probability reserve for possible value overruns.
Failure to Plan
If you would like to succeed in , you're getting to need to treat your small business in much the equal way that larger, strong companies negotiate theirs. Have a difficult plan together with your vision, goals, or some marketing research. Produce a business plan with a selected budget, cash flow, and break-even reviews. These do not have to belong, reported documents. In fact, you'll build most of what you would like among a couple of flowcharts, mind maps, outline charts, and other business strategy plans.
Not Taking Expert Opinion
you will settle a touch more for a defender and a CPA to form your business organized than if you are doing it yourself. But this is not replanting the flower bed within the yard. Mistakes are often extremely costly. Good professionals will quite buy themselves over time and you will sleep strongly knowing that you simply have things found out correctly.
Time Management
Each plan is merely helpful if you hold thereto. That needs managing time well. Soon, managing time well doesn't suggest packing such a lot into your schedule that you simply can't probably catch on done. Select and choose what's necessary, consider the much stuff, and obtain it done. Small things will fall flat the cracks. Let them. If they're very relevant, they'll come up.</a>

                            8. You are recently promoted as the chief traffic management officer of a major city in the country. Based on recent data, you learned that one of the leading causes of road accidents is over speeding. In your desire to minimize road accidents, you went out to observe how traffic management rules are implemented on the streets. Your attention was caught by a fast - moving car that seemed to be breaking the speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour(km/hr.), and so you followed it along the highway. After a short time, the driver of the car noticed you and started to slow down. Eventually, he stopped on the side of the road. Supposed the speed of the car had been noted during this time and is modeled by the quadratic equation y = 3x² + 17x - 20, where y represents the speed of the car in km/hr. and x represents the number of minutes after you started following the car. How long did it take for the car to be under surveillance before it could finally stop on the side of the road? Did the driver of the car really break the speed limit of 100 km/hr.? Explain. The result of your observation will be presented to the students in your section and will be graded by your teacher. You will prepare an observation report highlighting whether it is necessary to come up with a more stringent implementation of traffic rules based on the outcome of your analysis of the problem that you encountered on the road. Your output will be evaluated based on the following standards: Thoroughness of analysis of the problem, Correctness of the solution of the problem, Completeness of the report, over all presentation.​</h2><br />

                            14. Business problem solution
There's nothing undoubtedly just like the excitement of maintaining your own business. But it also affects many challenges you demand to know and be prepared to manage.
Here are some simple little business problems or suggestions for a way to affect them.
Lacking Capital Flow
Through far the foremost important hurdle faced by start-ups and other tiny enterprises is money. Too multiple times, entrepreneurs don't start out with fairly capital. Start-up expenses often exceed the budget. When starting out, get multiple proposals for large-ticket items and always found out a probability reserve for possible value overruns.
Failure to Plan
If you would like to succeed in , you're getting to need to treat your small business in much the equal way that larger, strong companies negotiate theirs. Have a difficult plan together with your vision, goals, or some marketing research. Produce a business plan with a selected budget, cash flow, and break-even reviews. These do not have to belong, reported documents. In fact, you'll build most of what you would like among a couple of flowcharts, mind maps, outline charts, and other business strategy plans.
Not Taking Expert Opinion
you will settle a touch more for a defender and a CPA to form your business organized than if you are doing it yourself. But this is not replanting the flower bed within the yard. Mistakes are often extremely costly. Good professionals will quite buy themselves over time and you will sleep strongly knowing that you simply have things found out correctly.
Time Management
Each plan is merely helpful if you hold thereto. That needs managing time well. Soon, managing time well doesn't suggest packing such a lot into your schedule that you simply can't probably catch on done. Select and choose what's necessary, consider the much stuff, and obtain it done. Small things will fall flat the cracks. Let them. If they're very relevant, they'll come up.</h2><br />

Client Dependence2. Money Management3. Fatigue4. Founder Dependence5. Balancing Quality and Growth<p></p>The Bottom LineStarting a business is a significant achievement for many entrepreneurs, but maintaining one is the larger challenge. There are many common challenges every business faces, whether they are large or small. These include hiring the right people, building a brand, developing a customer base, and so on. However, some are strictly small business problems, ones most large companies grew out of long ago<p></p>1. Client DependenceIf a single client makes up more than half of your income, you are more independent contractor than a business owner. Diversifying your client base is vital to growing a business, but it can be difficult, especially when the client in question pays well and is on time. Having a client willing to pay on time for a product or service is a godsend for many small businesses.<p></p><p></p>Unfortunately, this can result in a longer-term handicap because, even if you have employees and so on, you may still be acting as a subcontractor for a more significant business. This arrangement allows the client to avoid the risks of adding payroll in an area where the work may dry up at any time, and all of that risk is transferred from the larger company to you and your employees. This arrangement can work if your main client has a consistent need for your product or service.<p></p>2. Money ManagementHaving enough cash to cover the bills is a must for any business, but it is also necessary for every individual. Whether your business or your life, one will likely emerge as a capital drain that puts pressure on the other. To avoid this problem, small business owners must either be heavily capitalized or pick up extra income to shore up cash reserves when needed. This is why many small businesses start with the founders working a job and building a business simultaneously. While this split focus can make it challenging to grow a business, running out of cash makes growing a business impossible.<p></p>Money management becomes even more important when cash is flowing into the business. Although handling business accounting and taxes may be within the capabilities of most business owners, professional help is usually a good idea. The complexity of a company’s books increases with each client and employee, so getting an assist on the bookkeeping can prevent it from becoming a reason not to expand.<p></p>3. FatigueThe hours, the work, and the constant pressure to perform wear on even the most passionate individuals. Many business owners—even successful ones—get stuck working much longer hours than their employees. Moreover, they fear their business will stall in their absence, so they avoid taking any time away from work to recharge.<p></p>Fatigue can lead to rash decisions about the business, including the desire to abandon it altogether. Finding a pace that keeps the business humming without grinding down the owner is a challenge that comes early (and often) in the evolution of a small business.<p></p>4. Founder DependenceIf you get hit by a car, is your business still producing income the next day? A business that can't operate without its founder is a business with a deadline. Many businesses suffer from founder dependence, and it is often caused by the founder <p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>paki brainles Po Ako plssssssssss<br />

Example of Problem i SolutionSeveral students receive poor grades on writingassignments, not because they lack the ability tocommunicate, but because they can not seem tomanage their time when it comes to a large project.They do not know where to begin, and therefore putthings off until the last minute. To solve this problem,students need to develop a timeline for completing theproject. If they divide the assignment into manageable"chunks" or parts and then set a schedule forcompleting each part, they will be able to finish theentire project before the deadline. Without the pressureof not knowing where to begin, the students will be ableto focus on the assignment and communicate theirideas effectively.1. What is the problem?2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>4.1 Historical Perspective</p><p>Good project management in construction must vigorously pursue the efficient utilization of labor, material and equipment. Improvement of labor productivity should be a major and continual concern of those who are responsible for cost control of constructed facilities. Material handling, which includes procurement, inventory, shop fabrication and field servicing, requires special attention for cost reduction. The use of new equipment and innovative methods has made possible wholesale changes in construction technologies in recent decades. Organizations which do not recognize the impact of various innovations and have not adapted to changing environments have justifiably been forced out of the mainstream of construction activities.</p><p></p><p>Observing the trends in construction technology presents a very mixed and ambiguous picture. On the one hand, many of the techniques and materials used for construction are essentially unchanged since the introduction of mechanization in the early part of the twentieth century. For example, a history of the Panama Canal construction from 1904 to 1914 argues that:</p><p></p><p>[T]he work could not have done any faster or more efficiently in our day, despite all technological and mechanical advances in the time since, the reason being that no present system could possibly carry the spoil away any faster or more efficiently than the system employed. No motor trucks were used in the digging of the canal; everything ran on rails. And because of the mud and rain, no other method would have worked half so well. [1]</p><p></p><p>In contrast to this view of one large project, one may also point to the continual change and improvements occurring in traditional materials and techniques. Bricklaying provides a good example of such changes:</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>hope it helps</strong><br />

A negative attitude on your part can trickle down through the employees and seep into your guests. This, in turn, colors their dining experience in a bad way. That’s a recipe for disaster.</p><p></p><p>Work on keeping a positive attitude at all times come what may.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Yes,Studies have shown that different fertilizer types, as well as fertilization modes and rates directly affect rice yield and quality [11–13]. </p><p>2. Why apply N FERTILIZER to rice</p><p>Nitrogen is the most limiting element in almost all soils. Thus, proper application of N fertilizers is vital to improve crop growth and grain yields, especially in intensive agricultural systems.</p><p>3.SPRING</p><p>Fertilizer is most effective when used on plants at their peak growing cycle. This is when the plant is leafing out for deciduous species, flowering, or putting on new growth after leaving the dormant winter stage. The time of year for fertilizing most plants would then be spring.</p><p></p><p>5.Water is a precious and scarce resource input in rice production, so it is very important that irrigation water is used wisely and efficiently. The current way growing irrigated rice in most Asian rice farms requires large amounts of water.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yan lang ung alam ko pero tama ung mga yan hindi ko na alam ung sa iba hope it helps thank you</p><br />

The main difficulty of several students receive poor grades on writing assignments, not because they lack the ability to communicate, but because they cannot seem to manage their time when it comes to a large project. They do not know where to begin and therefore put things off until the last minute. To solve this problem, students need to develop a timeline for completing the project. If they divide the assignment into manageable chunks or parts and then set a schedule for completing each part, they will be able to finish the entire project before the deadline.​</h2><br />
