Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</a>

                                            ACTIVITY 3: Few Minutes to Read It! Academic documents always require a degree of formality to show how they are written. A formal tone is what determines the genre of your academic document. Being formal does not mean to be wordy and stuff your document with long sentences and words. What it means is to be clear, concise, and objective. Let's get to know the degree of formality in the following sentences below. These texts differ in formality. One of the reasons for this difference is the different audiences they are targeting. Read the texts below carefully and then rank them from most formal (1), to most informal (3).__ A. Why write essays? In the modern world our thinking is largely transmitted by speech and through radio and television. At the university, however, you are required to do much of your thinking through writing. In the Humanities and Social Sciences you are inevitably required to produce a considerable number of essays. __B. It's a real shame that something as simple as a dict was not taken account of by nurses, thus causing unnecessary pain to the patient. It probably caused even more pain to the patient's family and friends having to see their loved one die like that. How would we feel if we saw our own relative go through that experience? __C. A major challenge in the national water plan is to determine the trade-offs between the costs of action (such as infrastructure improvements) designed to overcome water problems (such as too much water seepage and evaporation) with the public benefits (such as larger water flows downstream) of such actions.(pahelp po, thanku in advance po)​</a>

Formulate your synthesis and apply your knowledge on organizing sources. Be guided by the rubric. With the rise of smartphone technology, many parents are letting their children use their smartphones. While it may seem to be harmless, the benefits of letting children use smartphones can be argued. Smartphones can have an impact on a child's development. Children should not have smartphones due to the impact they have on a child's development. Before smartphones, what did children do for fun? Kids used to spend their free time playing outdoors with their friends. This is where children learned to interact with others. They made friends, and used their imagination to have fun. Children didn't require devices to stay entertained, they had to have fun with others. With the availability of smartphones, children are becoming familiar with them at a very early age. This leads parents to feel like they can cause their children to have social problems by using the devices too much or to be harassed for not using smart devices. This leaves some parents in between a rock and a hard place. (Craig) Smartphones prohibit children from socially interacting. Children who use their parent's smartphones for playing games miss out on opportunities to interact with others. Children can become addicted to the games, this can cause problems later in life when they need social skills. According to an article by Nina Pilapil, games that are designed for kids can keep them from social interaction Parents should limit their children's time spent on a smartphone and encourage them to play with friends instead. While exposure to smartphones is not necessarily a bad thing in small doses, it should be limited and monitored. (Pilapil) Children are becoming more obese. This is caused in part by a lack of physical activity. Smartphones are too great. Children will have less social interaction and more health and development problems when they use smartphones in excess. Children should not have smartphones due to the impact smartphones on a child's development. At first, I'm thinking that using phones​</a>

They accept you just the way you are. Some of them think that having petsis enough to make them happy. They are able to talk and share their problems orworries tot heir pets. Pets will listen and not be judgmental. That alone is a trueact of love that human beings fail to do. Orhan Pamuk once said that "dogs dospeak but only to those who know how to listen."​</a>

A formal tone is what determines the genre of your academic document. Being formal does not mean to be wordy and stuff your docunant with long sentences and words. What it means is to be clear, concise. and objective Let's get to know the degree of formality in the following sentences below. These texts differ in formality. One of the reasons for this difference is the different audiences they are targeting. Read the texts below carefully and then rank them from most formal (1), to most informal (3) A. Why write essays? In the modem world our drinking is largely transmitted by speech and through radio and television. At the university, however, you are required to do much of your thinking through writing. In the Humanities and Social Sciences you are inevitably required to produce a considerable number of essays. B. It's a real shame that something as simple as a diet was not taken account of by nurses, thus cousing unnecessary pain io the patient. It probably caused even more pam to the patient's family and friends having to see their loved one die like that. How would we feel if we saw our own relative go through that experience? C.

Good jobs are difficult to find because of economic depression.______c) It will be hard for us to imagine how somebody who can't read and write communicates with other people. A case in point is that one of my neighbors who is an old man and cannot read and write may only talk with others face to face. As for making friends by email and search information in newspaper, it is absolutely impossible. ______d) Furthermore, the ability to read and write could bring us lots of advantages. Suppose that people who have tired out with a hard week's sweat and effort may get lots of benefits and relief from reading a short novel and broaden his horizon by appreciating a nice poem. Many friends around me would believe reading and writing some effective ways to relax themselves.______e) Nearly all the jobs require people who can read and write very well.

Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</a>

Formulate your synthesis and apply your knowledge on organizing sources. Be guided by the rubric. With the rise of smartphone technology, many parents are letting their children use their smartphones. While it may seem to be harmless, the benefits of letting children use smartphones can be argued. Smartphones can have an impact on a child's development. Children should not have smartphones due to the impact they have on a child's development. Before smartphones, what did children do for fun? Kids used to spend their free time playing outdoors with their friends. This is where children learned to interact with others. They made friends, and used their imagination to have fun. Children didn't require devices to stay entertained, they had to have fun with others. With the availability of smartphones, children are becoming familiar with them at a very early age. This leads parents to feel like they can cause their children to have social problems by using the devices too much or to be harassed for not using smart devices. This leaves some parents in between a rock and a hard place. (Craig) Smartphones prohibit children from socially interacting. Children who use their parent's smartphones for playing games miss out on opportunities to interact with others. Children can become addicted to the games, this can cause problems later in life when they need social skills. According to an article by Nina Pilapil, games that are designed for kids can keep them from social interaction Parents should limit their children's time spent on a smartphone and encourage them to play with friends instead. While exposure to smartphones is not necessarily a bad thing in small doses, it should be limited and monitored. (Pilapil) Children are becoming more obese. This is caused in part by a lack of physical activity. Smartphones are too great. Children will have less social interaction and more health and development problems when they use smartphones in excess. Children should not have smartphones due to the impact smartphones on a child's development. At first, I'm thinking that using phones​</h2><br />

Pets are animals that human beings care for. There aredifferent types of animals that people keep as pets. However, the commonof animals that we rear are cats and dogs.There are many reasons why people keep pets. One, pets act as a goodcompanion for men. For instance, when you feel lonely, you know that there issomeone or something right there beside you. Pets especially dogs are loyalanimals because they will not forsake or leave your side unless you tell them to.Dogs will look into your eyes with such loving eyes, as a result all your troublesseem to fade away when you look into them. Even when you scold them, they willstill come back to you. As the saying goes "dogs are men's best friend."Besides that, keeping pets can relieve stress. Nowadays, seeing that we arevery busy with our personal affairs like work, school and assignments, pets arehere to relieve stress. Studies have shown that having pets reduce the risk ofgetting depression. Pets like dogs need exercise. We can even take them for walksaround the park. The pet owners will be healthier by exercising with their pets too.When the pet owners take their dogs for walks, they will also be meeting other petowners. Therefore, this will benefit both the pets and the owners. It is a win-winsituation for the pets and owners.In conclusion, it is very obvious that there are many reasons why people keeppets. Animals will love you unconditionally unlike some human beings. They willnot judge or discriminate you based on your looks whether you are fat, ugly, shortor tall. They accept you just the way you are. Some of them think that having petsis enough to make them happy. They are able to talk and share their problems orworries tot heir pets. Pets will listen and not be judgmental. That alone is a trueact of love that human beings fail to do. Orhan Pamuk once said that "dogs dospeak but only to those who know how to listen."​</h2><br />

Howevery having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins.share many interests: they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in anyother relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits.The advantages of being a twin are especiall evident in the early childhood years. In the earlyyears, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Siblingrivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birthFurthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense ofsupport and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs oflife and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support whichbuilds their relationship and creates trust between themIn contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacyand sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and fromparents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both becamewuccessful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012.para 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. Thetwins get married and become involved with their own new families.

Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</h2><br />
