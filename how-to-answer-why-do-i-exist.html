Abstract​)ENGLISH FOR ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL PURPOSESWhat I know:1.B 4.A2.D 5.B3.C 6.AWhat’s New:obesity, poverty, climate change, drugs, bullyingWhat’s More:1.The issue is about how technology has changed people’s lives, behavior and moral outlook.The writer’s stand: He is not against technological developments in fact it improves man’s way of living, but he also reminds us that same technology will advance evil and harm. Therefore, use technology wisely for the common good.2. At the comfort of technological products man has found his comfort zone to dwell and slowly forgetting the value of real human interactions that eventually changes man’s mind, culture and outlook in life.3.

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

Write this in your answer sheet. The Importance of Research for ICT Teachers February 8, 2011 How important is research for teachers in general, and ICT teachers in particular? One might be tempted to say that people learn in the same way now as they did thousands of years ago, so research, apart from keeping abreast of the latest developments in technology, is pretty redundant. I think there are problems with that attitude. First, we don't know what we don't know. Research can shed light on issues we didn't even know existed, and can raise questions we hadn't realized even needed asking. Second, I'm not convinced that people do learn in the same way as they did thousands of years ago. Technology has meant that we can make mistakes that would have been fatal in the past, through the use of simulations and modelling. Social media has meant that we can canvass, or be exposed to, views from a much wider range of people than would have been possible hitherto. This happens almost by accident. For example, I recently wrote an article about how school districts in the USA are spending their money on computer hardware. This led to comments by John McLear, Michael Pickett and someone called Hamish. All their views are interesting, especially as two of them (John and Michael) seem to feel the same way as I do about tablets vs netbooks (article on that subject is already in the works). Moreover, Michael has provided a couple of links to articles on his website which I am looking forward to reading, and provided a further reference on Twitter this morning. Perhaps in a sense the actual mechanisms by which stuff enters our brains, stays there and then becomes useful in a practical way really hasn't changed for millennia - which may or may not be true, but in a sense that is irrelevant. I'd also say that, if you discovered that your doctor hasn't read a medical journal article since he or she qualified, you might consider changing your doctor! Hopefully, research is not a life or death issue in education, but I do believe that what makes a professional a professional is keeping up-to-date with the issues and thinking that are pertinent to that subject. That's why it's quite right that the powers-that-be believe teachers should continue to do research, although I agree with Christina Preston (see below) that such research doesn't have to be at Masters level. What is research? On the one hand you have the highly academic stuff that universities and other institutions engage in. On the other hand, you have Freda Bloggs keeping a note of what happens in her classroom when she introduces a new application into her teaching. And somewhere in the middle are people like myself, who carry out research via online surveys or on Twitter. The methodology may not be scientific in the true sense of the term, but I like to think that at the very least it can act as a catalyst for discussion and flag up issues for further exploration.

What could possibly happen if their efforts to achieve democracy would generate physical violence in the process?" I say to you today, my friends, though, even though we face the difficulties of to- day and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the Ameri- can dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." 3.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The question cannot be answered, and not because of a limitation on our knowledge, but because of a flaw in the question itself.</p><p></p><p>Asking for the “why” means asking for the causes that explain what we wish to explain, such as the existence of entities. However, those causes would also have to exist, meaning that one hasn’t explained “why things exist” because one won’t have explained the existence of what is doing the causing. You can’t just tack on another explanation for that cause, because then you’d have to explain the cause of that cause, into infinity.</p><p></p><p>The question literally can’t be answered because no answer could possibly make any logical sense. However, don’t despair, this likely means that not everything requires a causal explanation. Something has always existed, even if what we see today involves change over many billions of years.</p><p></p><p>It doesn’t have to be a deity, either. It can simply be that natural existence as such doesn’t require an explanation. Nothing has to cause something to exist. Causal explanations pertain to change, not existence as such.</p><p></p><p>2.Your question basically boils down to “ if God is good, why is there evil?” This is debated throughout history, but I will give you the current theological take.</p><p></p><p>God does indeed have the power to destroy all evil. But before I tell how He could, let me explain something else first. When God created Humans, He created them in love. And because He loves us, that means he created us with free will. He could have simply forced us to love him, but he instead gave us the choice, because love without choice is not love.</p><p></p><p>When God created the world, there wasn't any evil in it. The one who introduced evil was man when they freely chose it. When man did that, it not only created evil in him, but in the world (natural disasters, animal violence, etc).</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if God wanted to destroy evil, He could do so very simply by getting rid of humans. But He does not; not because of inability or malevolence, but because He loves humans, even if He hates the choices they make. He wishes to see them come to goodness again, so He gave us the option of redeption by sending His Son as a sacrifice to take the punishment of our wrong doings. Again, he's not forcing us to choose Him. He gives us the option.</p><p></p><p>Tldr - God doesn't tolerate evil. But because evil comes from us, and because he loves us, he's choosing to spare us and give us the choice to come back to him before He returns.</p><p></p><p>3. Satan himself created himself to be evil. God’s creations are all good. But God gave His creations free will to do what they want to do. So Satan decided to rebel against God and thus be evil.</p><p></p><p>4. We are here in this world temporarily. For some temporary duties assigned to us. We need to finish them in the given time we have and ensure simultaneously to make the most of this life. Enjoy. Time is enough though most precious. Value it. Use it. Make it productive each day. Of all the assets we work hard to earn, one thing we get for no cost is Time, and it is the most priceless possessions we may have. Live with a smile. Always. Stay calm stay positive stay optimistic.</p><p></p><p>5. The root of our suffering is Desire, desire is why we are born, and seek all things.</p><p></p><p>When we accomplish these desires, fear of losing them rises.</p><p></p><p>When we could not accomplish these desires, fear of our inability to satiate ourselves rises.</p><p></p><p>Just when desires are fairly accomplished and fears are fairly mitigated, attachments rise gigantically.</p><p></p><p>Now, multiply these fears and desires of all those you are attached to. Continue multiplying this with their own inability to handle these, their reluctance to listen to you, and their self-inflicting pains that you have to bear with. This is getting exponential now.</p><p></p><p>An individual fear and desire can somehow be managed and mitigated. But when you are attached with other people, be prepared!</p><p></p><p>Fear and desire are the root of a manageable suffering.</p><p></p><p> This attachment is the root of exponential suffering.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>[tex]pasensiya \: na \: natagalan \: hindi \: ko[/tex]</p><p>[tex]ma \: send[/tex]</p><p></p><br />

Therefore, use technology wisely for the common good.2. At the comfort of technological products man has found his comfort zone to dwell and slowly forgetting the value of real human interactions that eventually changes man’s mind, culture and outlook in life.3.

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

The Importance of Research for ICT Teachers February 8, 2011 How important is research for teachers in general, and ICT teachers in particular? One might be tempted to say that people learn in the same way now as they did thousands of years ago, so research, apart from keeping abreast of the latest developments in technology, is pretty redundant. I think there are problems with that attitude. First, we don't know what we don't know. Research can shed light on issues we didn't even know existed, and can raise questions we hadn't realized even needed asking. Second, I'm not convinced that people do learn in the same way as they did thousands of years ago. Technology has meant that we can make mistakes that would have been fatal in the past, through the use of simulations and modelling. Social media has meant that we can canvass, or be exposed to, views from a much wider range of people than would have been possible hitherto. This happens almost by accident. For example, I recently wrote an article about how school districts in the USA are spending their money on computer hardware. This led to comments by John McLear, Michael Pickett and someone called Hamish. All their views are interesting, especially as two of them (John and Michael) seem to feel the same way as I do about tablets vs netbooks (article on that subject is already in the works). Moreover, Michael has provided a couple of links to articles on his website which I am looking forward to reading, and provided a further reference on Twitter this morning. Perhaps in a sense the actual mechanisms by which stuff enters our brains, stays there and then becomes useful in a practical way really hasn't changed for millennia - which may or may not be true, but in a sense that is irrelevant. I'd also say that, if you discovered that your doctor hasn't read a medical journal article since he or she qualified, you might consider changing your doctor! Hopefully, research is not a life or death issue in education, but I do believe that what makes a professional a professional is keeping up-to-date with the issues and thinking that are pertinent to that subject. That's why it's quite right that the powers-that-be believe teachers should continue to do research, although I agree with Christina Preston (see below) that such research doesn't have to be at Masters level. What is research? On the one hand you have the highly academic stuff that universities and other institutions engage in. On the other hand, you have Freda Bloggs keeping a note of what happens in her classroom when she introduces a new application into her teaching. And somewhere in the middle are people like myself, who carry out research via online surveys or on Twitter. The methodology may not be scientific in the true sense of the term, but I like to think that at the very least it can act as a catalyst for discussion and flag up issues for further exploration.

It challenges the notion that learning today is the same as it was in the past and highlights the need for research to address unknown issues and raise important questions.</p><p></p><p>Problem/s:</p><p>The article identifies two problems with dismissing the significance of research. Firstly, it emphasizes that research can bring to light unknown issues and raise questions that were previously unrecognized. Secondly, it argues that learning methods have changed due to technology, enabling simulations, modeling, and exposure to diverse views through social media.</p><p></p><p>Method Used:</p><p>The author presents their perspective and personal experiences related to research in the field of education and ICT. They mention writing an article and receiving comments from various individuals, engaging in online surveys, and using Twitter as a means of research.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The author concludes by asserting that research is crucial for professionals, including teachers. They compare it to the medical field, suggesting that professionals should stay up-to-date with relevant issues and thinking in their subject area. While acknowledging that research need not always be at the Master's level, they emphasize the importance of teachers continuing to engage in research to remain informed and enhance their professional practice.</p><p></p><p>Source: https://www.ictineducation.org/home-page/2011/2/8/the-importance-of-research-for-ict-teachers.html</p><br />

                            14. II. Directions: Read the poem: "To Helen " by Edgar Allan Poe and answer thequestions that follow.To HelenBY EDGAR ALLAN POEHelen, thy beauty is to meLike those Nicéan barks of yore,That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,The weary, way-worn wanderer boreTo his own native shore.On desperate seas long wont to roam,Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,Thy Naiad airs have brought me homeTo the glory that was Greece,And the grandeur that was Rome.Lo! in yon brilliant window-nicheHow statue-like I see thee stand,The agate lamp within thy hand!Ah, Psyche, from the regions whichAre Holy-Land!1.Identify and write the line in the poem where the author makescomparison with flowers?2.Who do you think is the wanderer in the last two lines of the first stanza?3.What does the author trying to imply in these lines:Lo! in yon brilliant window-nicheLow statue-like I see thee stand,4.What is the tone of the poem as expressed by the author?5.Was the life of the author shown in the poem? In what way?6."To Helen" is a lyric poem extolling the beauty of a woman.Is this type ofexpressions still exist in our modern times? Why do you say so?please need kopo ng answer​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.	Identify and write the line in the poem where the author makes
</p><p>comparison with flowers?
</p><p>
</p><p>Answer:  Helen, thy beauty is to me  </p><p>Like those Nice'an barks of yore,
</p><p>-This line is like flowers whenever you see it, its makes beauty and nice to your eyes.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2.Who do you think is the wanderer in the last two lines of the first stanza?
</p><p>Answer: It’s Helen.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3.What does the author trying to imply in these lines:
</p><p>Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche
</p><p>Low statue-like I see thee stand,
</p><p>
</p><p>•	Answer: The speaker is floored by Helen's beauty as he sees her standing in the "window niche" (like a nook). Saying "Lo" is like saying OMG when you all of a sudden see something astonishing. Helen is standing "statue-like," which means both that she resembles a work of art and that she is not moving at all.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>4.What is the tone of the poem as expressed by the author?
</p><p>Answer: The tone of the poem is written in admiration in a heavenly and dreamy language towards the stellar features of the legendary Helen of Troy set in the picturesque ancient Greek where various aspects of creativity and theory developed. It also shows the underlying love Poe has for his first lady, Jane Stanard.
</p><p>
</p><p>5.Was the life of the author shown in the poem? In what way?
</p><p>Answer: Yes, it has shown there through his stanzas you could tell how he described Helen and how their lives together as well as his life being with Helen.

                            29. Learning Task 7: Read and analyze the excerpted lines taken from Martin Luther King's speech, I Have A Dream. The whole text may be accessed at https://www.american rhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm. Copy and answer the following in your notebook. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.use your conditionals in your answer." Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. "1. If social injustice had not existed, what would probably the experiences of his people? 2. What could possibly happen if their efforts to achieve democracy would generate physical violence in the process?" I say to you today, my friends, though, even though we face the difficulties of to- day and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the Ameri- can dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." 3. If you were given the chance to talk to King after his speech, what would you tell or ask him? 4. If you were King, would you dream the same thing for your country? Why or why not?" When we allow freedom ring - when we let it ring from every city and every ham- let, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, we will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual,Free at last! Free at last! Great God Almighty, We are free at last! " 5. For King, how does it feel to be free from discrimination and injustices? 6. What do you think will happen when Filipinos unite and respect differences?​</h2><br />
                        The African-American community would be able to exercise their rights and live lives that are not under discrimination and threat. They would be able to contribute greater to society because they are not being inhibited by hate and stigma from the community. The<strong> African - American culture </strong>would have an earlier role in shaping the American countryThen Dr. Kng’s speeches would have been considered a failure, because Dr. King <strong>envisioned</strong> a future where there are no prejudices, not only towards his own race but to all races. If this would result in violence then everything that he would have fought for would be for naught because enacting violence in the name of freedom would only further the cycle of hate that he wished to stop.I would like to ask him how he was able to do it to forego violence in exchange for a better way, a peaceful way of demonstration. I would ask him for advice and how he was able to be brave and stand up for what is right. I would ask for stories to inspire me and motivate me to become a better person in a world that is broken and hated. Given the chance and the background, yes I would dream the same dream. Knowing what the African - American community has been through and currently going thru, I think I would also dream of a better country for my people and all the other people residing in our country. I would dream of a society no longer gripped and overcome with hate and prejudice but a country of inclusion and equity. It would have been freeing both in mind, body, and spirit, knowing that something that his ancestors fought for and suffered for has finally come to fruition it would have been an unreal and freeing moment for him The is nothing more powerful than a united society with respect and care for each other. I think we would be able to achieve great things if we come to a point to set aside our differences and focus on creating a better country for the future generation and ourselves <p>To learn more about who Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/249478?referrer=searchResults</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p><br />
