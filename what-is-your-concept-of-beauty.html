Write your answers in your notebook or on a separate sheet of paper. Do not write anything on the module. KON Processing Questions: 1. How will you describe the building based on its structure and design? 2. Which parts of the building do you think have similar designs? 3. Which parts of the building have contrasting designs? The picture above clearly tells us how a structure or form affects the overall design of a building. Designs can be repeated and similar in many ways. Contrasts in the design are also included to add beauty to a structure. The same concept applies to music. In a music composition, some sections or parts can be heard repeatedly. There are parts that sound similar and contrasting parts are added to give harmony to the music. It is important to know the different forms or designs in music. Understanding the structure of a musical composition adds a great deal of understanding and deep appreciation for music.​</a>

Write your answers in your notebook or on a separate sheet of paper. Do not write anything on the module. KON Processing Questions: 1. How will you describe the building based on its structure and design? 2. Which parts of the building do you think have similar designs? 3. Which parts of the building have contrasting designs? The picture above clearly tells us how a structure or form affects the overall design of a building. Designs can be repeated and similar in many ways. Contrasts in the design are also included to add beauty to a structure. The same concept applies to music. In a music composition, some sections or parts can be heard repeatedly. There are parts that sound similar and contrasting parts are added to give harmony to the music. It is important to know the different forms or designs in music. Understanding the structure of a musical composition adds a great deal of understanding and deep appreciation for music.​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. The Malacañang Palace is a grand and majestic building with a neoclassical architectural style. Its façade is symmetrical with columns and pilasters supporting the structure. The roof has a triangular pediment with ornamentation, and the entrance has a grand staircase leading to the main door. The building's overall design exudes power and authority, which is fitting for its role as the official residence and workplace of the President of the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>2. The columns and pilasters on the façade of the Malacañang Palace have similar designs. They are evenly spaced and have the same height and width, giving a sense of balance and symmetry to the structure.</p><p></p><p>3. One example of contrasting designs in the Malacañang Palace is the use of different materials for the façade. The lower part of the building is made of stone while the upper part is painted in white. The use of these two contrasting materials creates a visual break that emphasizes the building's height and grandeur. Another example is the ornate decoration on the roof's triangular pediment compared to the simpler design on the rest of the structure, which adds an element of interest and texture to the overall design.</p><p></p>Answered By: Ryximyugi.✅#Brainliest✅<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
