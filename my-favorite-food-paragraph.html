Activity 1.3
Kaly Loves Tuna
Kaly is a cat. She loves to eat tuna. One day, she found dried leaves 
near her feeding bowl. She thought that the dry leaves were delicious 
tuna. So, she ate the leaves. Kaly did not like the leaves. They were not 
as tasty as her favorite food. “Tuna is better,” she said. “I will just sleep 
and wait my tuna to be served.”</a>

Underline the two sentences that violate the elements of unity and coherence. 1. Life in a New Place I am from Abulug, Cagayan, but now living in Tuguegarao City to study. There are many adjustments that I must make. First of all, I must get used to do all the household chores since I am living in a small apartment all by myself. Especially, I need to learn how to prepare my own food even if fast food chains are just around the corner. My favorite though is Jollibee; its fried chicken with gravy is the best. The busyness of the place requires another kind of adjustment. In my hometown, there aren't any malls yet, the number of people is small, and activities are limited. Abulug is a coastal municipality in the province of Cagayan. Lastly, my school then is small; but now I need to adapt to a big institution with big buildings and new facilities. I am adjusting to Tuguegarao City in some ways, but it is not a problem for me because I love this place as much as I love my hometown. 2. My Staycation​</a>

Both of them are my favorite food because they are so delicious. My favorite spaghetti is my mother’s homemade spaghetti and she also taught me how to cook a spaghetti and for me her spaghetti was truly the best.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>    Spaghetti is my favorite because it is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water. Sometimes it is enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum wheat semolina.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>      Ice cream is my favorite food too. It is a frozen dairy dessert obtained by freezing the ice cream mix with continuous agitation. It contains milk products, sweetening materials, stabilizers, colors, flavors, and egg products. It is a rich, sweet, creamy frozen food made from variously flavored cream and milk products churned or stirred to a smooth consistency during the freezing process and often containing gelatin, eggs, fruits, nuts and more. My favorite ice cream flavor is (your favorite ice cream flavor) because I think it is the best among the flavors.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>      Ice cream is my favorite dessert. My favorite ice cream is my father’s homemade ice cream it is so delicious. He taught me how to make an ice cream and told me the ingredients which is water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. I really enjoyed eating my father’s homemade ice cream.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>                                         My Favorite food</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>            My favorite food is an apple pie. It has double-crusted, with pastry both above and below the filling; the upper crust may be solid or lattice. It was sweet but never cloying, with a bare hint of cinnamon. My favorite apple pie was my grandma’s homemade apple pie. </strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>            For me my grandma’s apple pie was truly the best. She told me the ingredients of an apple pie which are an apple, a butter, a flour, cinnamon, egg, lemon, pie crust, juice, brown sugar and ground cinnamon. She also told me to  Toss the apples with the rest of the filling (including spices, flour, butter, and both light and brown sugars), and let it sit overnight. She taught me that the 9-inch pie must be in the oven to heat for 15-20 minutes. A 5-inch pie will take about 12-15 minutes and turnovers will take about 10-12 minutes</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>          Her apple pie is truly the best and for me no one can beat her apple pie. For my opinion an apple pie is better than tart pie. The tarts only have a bottom crust, and the crust is much thicker than a pie crust. She explained to me that the pie is a dish made by lining a shallow container with pastry and filling the container with a sweet or savoury mixture.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>      </strong></p><p><strong>         She told me to remember the secret to a great apple pie filling is to precook the apples.This will ensure perfect consistency and balanced sweetness. You'll also avoid that gap between the crust and the filling. She also told me that an apple pie is done when the juices are bubbling through the vents of the top crust or lattice. I love her apple pie and it is my number one favorite food.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

There are many adjustments that I must make. First of all, I must get used to do all the household chores since I am living in a small apartment all by myself. Especially, I need to learn how to prepare my own food even if fast food chains are just around the corner. My favorite though is Jollibee; its fried chicken with gravy is the best. The busyness of the place requires another kind of adjustment. In my hometown, there aren't any malls yet, the number of people is small, and activities are limited. Abulug is a coastal municipality in the province of Cagayan. Lastly, my school then is small; but now I need to adapt to a big institution with big buildings and new facilities. I am adjusting to Tuguegarao City in some ways, but it is not a problem for me because I love this place as much as I love my hometown. 2. My Staycation​</h2><br />

If you have concerns or issues with your friend, it's important to talk about them openly and without judgment. Be willing to listen to their perspective and work together to find a solution that works for both of you. By being honest and open with each other, you can strengthen your friendship and build a foundation of trust and respect that will last a lifetime.</p><p></p><p></p><p>pa brainly naman</p><p>nagawa ko na to dati</p><br />
