I'm Kate. I want to write about my mobile phone. I got it from my parents for my birthday two years ago. I like it very much and I think it's sometimes good to have it in my bag. I always keep it in my bag or in my pocket so my parents and my friends can always call me. It's got a calculator in it so I sometimes use it at school. I can use my mobile phone to connect to the Internet and look through the news or read emails. Isn't it fantastic? Last year I was on a cycling holiday with my friend. We went cycling but the weather wasn't good. It was cold and windy. It started to rain and it got dark. Suddenly my friend fell off her bike and she broke her leg. At first I didn't know what to do but I thought about my phone. It was in my backpack so I called for help. After fifteen minutes a doctor arrived. Sometimes people are not used on exploring their mobile phones which is a big problem because mobile phones plays a very important role in our daily life especially we are now in a digital world. Mobile phones can help us do our work easier and it helps us connected all throughout the world. I'm not crazy about my mobile phone but I feel safe when I have it with me. 1. Kate can't exist without her mobile phone.2. She got her mobile phone in January. 3. She usually listens to music on her mobile phone.4. There's a calculator in her mobile phone. 5. Her parents bought her the mobile phone two years ago.​</a>

What were his or her qualities that you liked? Why? AnswerWhen I was young my first model was my mother, because she was cheerful, turned out to be a friend, sociable with everyone around her, and she was very diligent. He is not tired of taking care of us siblings, while he is still doing his other duties at the same time. I have nothing else to say to my mother but to admire him for all that he can do for us.​</a>

I'm Kate. I want to write about my mobile phone. I got it from my parents for my birthday two years ago. I like it very much and I think it's sometimes good to have it in my bag. I always keep it in my bag or in my pocket so my parents and my friends can always call me. It's got a calculator in it so I sometimes use it at school. I can use my mobile phone to connect to the Internet and look through the news or read emails. Isn't it fantastic? Last year I was on a cycling holiday with my friend. We went cycling but the weather wasn't good. It was cold and windy. It started to rain and it got dark. Suddenly my friend fell off her bike and she broke her leg. At first I didn't know what to do but I thought about my phone. It was in my backpack so I called for help. After fifteen minutes a doctor arrived. Sometimes people are not used on exploring their mobile phones which is a big problem because mobile phones plays a very important role in our daily life especially we are now in a digital world. Mobile phones can help us do our work easier and it helps us connected all throughout the world. I'm not crazy about my mobile phone but I feel safe when I have it with me. 1. Kate can't exist without her mobile phone. 2. She got her mobile phone in January. 3. She usually listens to music on her mobile phone. 4. There's a calculator in her mobile phone. 5. Her parents bought her the mobile phone two years ago..</a>

                                            MY MOBILE PHONE Hello, I'm Kate. I want to write about my mobile phone. I got it from my parents for my birthday two years ago. I like it very much and I think it's sometimes good to have it in my bag. I always keep it in my bag or in my pocket so my parents and my friends can always call me. It's got a calculator in it so I sometimes use it at school. I can use my mobile phone to connect to the Internet and look through the news or read emails. Isn't it fantastic? Last year I was on a cycling holiday with my friend. We went cycling but the weather wasn't good. It was cold and windy. It started to rain and it got dark. Suddenly my friend fell off her bike and she broke her leg. At first I didn't know what to do but I thought about my phone. It was in my backpack so I called for help. After fifteen minutes a doctor arrived. Sometimes people are not used on exploring their mobile phones which is a big problem because mobile phones plays a very important role in our daily life especially we are now in a digital world. Mobile phones can help us do our work easier and it helps us connected all throughout the world. I'm not crazy about my mobile phone but I feel safe when I have it with me. 1. Kate can't exist without her mobile phone. 2. She got her mobile phone in January. 3. She usually listens to music on her mobile phone. 4. There's a calculator in her mobile phone. 5. Her parents bought her the mobile phone two years no​</a>

I want to write about my mobile phone. I got it from my parents for my birthday two years ago. I like it very much and I think it's sometimes good to have it in my bag. I always keep it in my bag or in my pocket so my parents and my friends can always call me. It's got a calculator in it so I sometimes use it at school. I can use my mobile phone to connect to the Internet and look through the news or read emails. Isn't it fantastic? Last year I was on a cycling holiday with my friend. We went cycling but the weather wasn't good. It was cold and windy. It started to rain and it got dark. Suddenly my friend fell off her bike and she broke her leg. At first I didn't know what to do but I thought about my phone. It was in my backpack so I called for help. After fifteen minutes a doctor arrived. Sometimes people are not used on exploring their mobile phones which is a big problem because mobile phones plays a very important role in our daily life especially we are now in a digital world.
