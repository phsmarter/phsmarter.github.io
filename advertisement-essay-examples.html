                            29. ESSAY 1. What is the difference between traditional and contemporary marketing? 2. Provide an example of an advertisement that uses the hard sell approach and describe the content of its message, Do you think this is an effective marketing strategy? Why or why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p> </p><p>Traditional marketing and contemporary marketing are two different approaches to promoting products and services. Here are some of the main differences between the two:</p><p></p><p>1.Channels: Traditional marketing primarily uses traditional channels such as print, radio, and television ads, while contemporary marketing relies heavily on digital channels such as social media, email, and mobile marketing. </p><p></p><p>2.Audience: Traditional marketing often targets a broad audience, whereas contemporary marketing focuses on niche markets and personalized targeting.</p><p></p><p>3.Communication: Traditional marketing is often one-way communication, with the company broadcasting its message to the audience. In contrast, contemporary marketing is two-way communication, with customers engaging with the brand and providing feedback.</p><p></p><p>4.Metrics: Traditional marketing relies on metrics such as reach and frequency, while contemporary marketing uses metrics such as engagement, conversions, and return on investment (ROI).</p><p></p><p>5.Cost: Traditional marketing can be more expensive due to the cost of production and distribution of physical materials, such as billboards and print ads. In contrast, contemporary marketing can be more cost-effective due to the ability to target specific audiences and the lower cost of digital advertising.</p><p></p><p>Overall, contemporary marketing is more focused on personalization, engagement, and data-driven insights, while traditional marketing is often characterized by a broader focus and mass media channels. Both approaches can be effective, depending on the target audience, product or service, and marketing goals.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For the second question </p><p>Provide an example of an advertisement that uses the hard sell approach and describe the content of its message, Do you think this is an effective marketing strategy? Why or why not?</p><p></p><p></p><p>One example of an advertisement that uses the hard sell approach is a car commercial that highlights the vehicle's safety features and durability. The message of the ad typically revolves around the idea that the car is the safest and most reliable option on the market, and that customers who choose this car are making a smart and responsible choice for themselves and their families. The content of the message might include statistics about the car's safety ratings, testimonials from satisfied customers, and dramatic visuals of the car driving in extreme conditions or avoiding accidents. The tone of the ad is often urgent and persuasive, emphasizing the importance of making the right choice when it comes to safety and reliability.Whether or not this is an effective marketing strategy depends on a few factors. On the one hand, the hard sell approach can be effective in convincing customers to make a purchase by creating a sense of urgency and emphasizing the benefits of the product. By highlighting the safety and reliability of the car, the ad is appealing to customers who are looking for a long-term investment and are willing to pay a premium for quality.On the other hand, the hard sell approach can also be off-putting to some customers, who may feel that they are being manipulated or pressured into making a purchase. Additionally, the ad may not be effective in reaching customers who are not interested in safety and reliability as their primary concerns when choosing a car.Overall, while the hard sell approach can be effective in certain situations, it is not always the best strategy for every product or audience. Marketers should carefully consider their target audience and messaging goals before deciding whether to use a hard sell approach or another marketing strategy.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Miss q na sya super</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />
