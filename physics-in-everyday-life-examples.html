                                            TITLE-The Five Essential Elements of a Story
CHARACTERS: The characters are the individuals that the story is about.The author should introduce the characters in the story with enough information that the reader can visualize each person. This is achieved by providing detailed descriptions of a character’s physical attributes and personality traits. Every story should have a main character. The main character determines the way the plot will
develop and is usually who will solve the problem the story centers upon. However, the other characters are also very important because they supply additional details, explanations, or actions. All characters should stay true to the author’s descriptions throughout the story so that the reader can understand and believe the action that is taking place—and perhaps even predict which character may do what next.
SETTING: The setting is the location of the action. An author should describe the
environment or surroundings of the story in such detail that the reader feels that he
or she can picture the scene. Unusual settings (such as a fantasy world) can be
interesting, but everyday settings can help a reader to better visualize the story and
feel connected to the plot!
PLOT: The plot is the actual story around which the entire book is based. A plot should have a very clear beginning, middle, and end—with all the necessary descriptions and suspense, called exposition—so that the reader can make sense of the action and follow along from start to finish.
CONFLICT: Every story has a conflict to solve. The plot is centered on this conflict and the ways in which the characters attempt to resolve the problem. When the story’s action becomes most exciting, right before the resolution, it is called the climax.
RESOLUTION: The solution to the problem is the way the action is resolved. For
example, Katie often resolves a conflict by finding a compromise for two fighting
characters or helping fix any mistakes she made while switcherooed into someone else.It is important that the resolution fit the rest of the story in tone and creativity and
solve all parts of the conflict.
Guide Questions:
1. Who are the main and supporting characters in the story?
2. When and where did the story take place? Which part of the story reveals the conflict?
3. Why did the judge dismiss the case?
4. What lesson did you learn from the two fathers in the story?
5. Which part of the story shows event that could happen in real life? Why?
6. In the story, what realization in life did you have?</a>

                                            here are three types of truth. The first is seeking truth in the arts. The
creative artist tries to explore beneath the surface of things so as to obtain a more
in-depth understanding of human experience. The expressiveness of the artist.
However, it takes on different forms. Forms inherent to the arts. The artist seeks
truth not in rational argumentation, but rather through his perception, his
imagination, his institutions and even emotions.
The second type of truth is scientific truth. Just like the philosopher and the
artist the scientist is engaged in truth seeking activities. He makes discoveries
about the world; and he tries to make rational sense and coherent explanations of
his observations. He conducts physical experiments and often making use of
mathematical formulas either to verify or negate his starting assumptions.
Eventually he draws conclusions concurring to the results of his experiments. That
is how the scientist defines truth.
The third type of truth is, of course, philosophical truth. Here, reason and
reasoning pervades. To arrive at philosophical truths, inquiry is absolutely
required. Philosophers delve into and scrutinize cases involving human affairs and
conduct. They ask fundamental questions pertaining to such cases. They disagree
and argue amongst themselves on the merits of these cases. Such is the procedure
in trying to ascertain philosophical truths. Such is he establishing of the Socratic
method the first great critical method.

You cannot touch foce, but you can see its effect. Cars breaking, leaves swinging, and marbles rolling are some exampies of the effes is of force. Force is useful in our everyday life but we also need to be careful because it can also be harmfui. The size of an object can be changed when you apply force. There are also several ways to change the soul on ubject like cuning, sireicning, pounding, dropping, and slicing. After you apply force, sorne objects retain elr size bui vihers do not. The force applied on an object affects the movement of an object.Example: Push and Go - The toy car travelled father when triecrce upplied was stronger. It travelled nearer when lesser the force was applied to it. Hang and pull - The spring balance stretched down wien a paciock was hanged to it.

                            20. TITLE-The Five Essential Elements of a Story
CHARACTERS: The characters are the individuals that the story is about.The author should introduce the characters in the story with enough information that the reader can visualize each person. This is achieved by providing detailed descriptions of a character’s physical attributes and personality traits. Every story should have a main character. The main character determines the way the plot will
develop and is usually who will solve the problem the story centers upon. However, the other characters are also very important because they supply additional details, explanations, or actions. All characters should stay true to the author’s descriptions throughout the story so that the reader can understand and believe the action that is taking place—and perhaps even predict which character may do what next.
SETTING: The setting is the location of the action. An author should describe the
environment or surroundings of the story in such detail that the reader feels that he
or she can picture the scene. Unusual settings (such as a fantasy world) can be
interesting, but everyday settings can help a reader to better visualize the story and
feel connected to the plot!
PLOT: The plot is the actual story around which the entire book is based. A plot should have a very clear beginning, middle, and end—with all the necessary descriptions and suspense, called exposition—so that the reader can make sense of the action and follow along from start to finish.
CONFLICT: Every story has a conflict to solve. The plot is centered on this conflict and the ways in which the characters attempt to resolve the problem. When the story’s action becomes most exciting, right before the resolution, it is called the climax.
RESOLUTION: The solution to the problem is the way the action is resolved. For
example, Katie often resolves a conflict by finding a compromise for two fighting
characters or helping fix any mistakes she made while switcherooed into someone else.It is important that the resolution fit the rest of the story in tone and creativity and
solve all parts of the conflict.
Guide Questions:
1. Who are the main and supporting characters in the story?
2. When and where did the story take place? Which part of the story reveals the conflict?
3. Why did the judge dismiss the case?
4. What lesson did you learn from the two fathers in the story?
5. Which part of the story shows event that could happen in real life? Why?
6. In the story, what realization in life did you have?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A mystery is a story that has five basic but important elements. These five components are: the characters, the setting, the plot, the problem, and the solution. ... The author should introduce the characters in the story with enough information that the reader can visualize each person.</p><br />

                            22. here are three types of truth. The first is seeking truth in the arts. The
creative artist tries to explore beneath the surface of things so as to obtain a more
in-depth understanding of human experience. The expressiveness of the artist.
However, it takes on different forms. Forms inherent to the arts. The artist seeks
truth not in rational argumentation, but rather through his perception, his
imagination, his institutions and even emotions.
The second type of truth is scientific truth. Just like the philosopher and the
artist the scientist is engaged in truth seeking activities. He makes discoveries
about the world; and he tries to make rational sense and coherent explanations of
his observations. He conducts physical experiments and often making use of
mathematical formulas either to verify or negate his starting assumptions.
Eventually he draws conclusions concurring to the results of his experiments. That
is how the scientist defines truth.
The third type of truth is, of course, philosophical truth. Here, reason and
reasoning pervades. To arrive at philosophical truths, inquiry is absolutely
required. Philosophers delve into and scrutinize cases involving human affairs and
conduct. They ask fundamental questions pertaining to such cases. They disagree
and argue amongst themselves on the merits of these cases. Such is the procedure
in trying to ascertain philosophical truths. Such is he establishing of the Socratic
method the first great critical method.
