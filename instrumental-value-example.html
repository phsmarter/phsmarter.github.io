                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.)The second step, Set In Order, was originally called “seiton,” which translates to “orderliness.” A variety of names have been used in English: “Systematic Organization,” “Straightening Out,” and “Simplify,” for example. No matter what it's called, the goal of this step is to organize the work area.</p><p>2.)Conscientiously cleaning your devices is crucial, as any residue that remains on your device may impact the accuracy of your measurements. The material your device is made of plays a significant role in the cleaning method you should use.</p><p>3.)Increase accuracy: If measuring tools don’t receive proper care and maintenance, they’re more likely to take inaccurate readings. Some of these tools take exact measurements, so even small changes can impact the accuracy of measurements. Damaged instruments may also be off by relatively large amounts. If you don’t realize your measurements are off, these inaccuracies could get in the way of the success of a job. A wide variety of factors can impact the accuracy of a measuring tool, from improper storage temperature to excessive vibrations to physical damage due to dropping it. Because damage or improper maintenance can affect accuracy, it’s crucial that you’re careful to maintain them properly. Measuring tools also fall out of calibration naturally over time, so regular gage calibration is essential.</p><p>4.)A digital Kanban board is a Lean tool that helps teams visualize and improve their processes, so they can eliminate waste.</p><p>5.)The three standard systems of measurements are the International System of Units (SI) units, the British Imperial System, and the US Customary System. Of these, the International System of Units(SI) units are prominently used.</p><p>6.)Maintain dry storage temperatures between 50° and 70° F. Freezers must keep food frozen solid with an internal temperature of 0° F at most. Keep temperatures between 32° and 40° F in refrigeration units to prevent bacterial growth. Hot storage must keep food at a minimum of 140° F.</p><p>7.)Do not store precision instruments where they can jostle against one another in a drawer; instead, separate instruments from one another using dividers or place them in padded cases. Avoid stacking instruments on top of each other, unless they are well-protected in cases.</p><p>8.)Go vertical. Tools should never be stored on the ground. Invest in some shelving for smaller tools, or hang pegboard along your workbench or on a wall in your garage. You'll be able to hang things like wrenches, hammers, box cutters, garden equipment and many other tools so they'll be easy to access at any time.</p><p>9.)Simply stated the “Rule of Ten” or “one to ten” is that the discrimination (resolution) of the measuring instrument should divide the tolerance of the characteristic to be measured into ten parts. In other words, the gage or measuring instrument should be 10 times as accurate as the characteristic to be measured.</p><p>10.)The first step in the 5S process is Sort, or “seiri,” which translates to “tidiness.” The goal of the Sort step is to eliminate clutter and clear up space by removing things that don't belong in the area</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>if my answer is wrong im sorry this was all i can do but can you atleast brainliest me?</p><br />
