                                            Give your thought about this scenario: A teacher noticed a remarkable similarity among four programs turned in by different students. Apparently, three students in one classroom had copied a computer program from a student in another class, and then turned it in as their own work. The teacher and another faculty member had spent many hours investigating the situation and were able to conclusively prove the theft. The teacher told the students that he could not accept the programs, and gave the students an opportunity to make up the work within a limited time frame. Here is how the three students handled the situation : 1. Student A was embarrassed and apologized for violating the teacher's trust. He worked very hard during the time limit, sacrificing grades in other classes, but was able to turn in a better program than what was originally assigned for the copied program. 2. Student B said nothing, but did not have time to complete the program within the time limit due to pressures from other courses. He accepted the failing grade. He was having difficulty in the course anyway, so eventually dropped the class. 3. Student C did not apologize, but apparently found another program written by a student in a previous year for a different teacher, copied that program and turned it in as his own. The teachers were able to prove this second incident and called for a parent conference. Neither the parent nor the student apologize, but the parent blame the school, claiming that the teachers were at fault for having a system where students can take the "easy way out" by being able to copy work too easily.                                          Question :How should the teachers respond to the parental complaints of student C? if they fail the student, the student will likely be rejected from the Ivy League College and could lose scholarship opportunities. If they bow to the parent's pressure and allow a third try to make up the work, this student will have an affair advantage over student B? ​</a>

                            12. Give your thought about this scenario: A teacher noticed a remarkable similarity among four programs turned in by different students. Apparently, three students in one classroom had copied a computer program from a student in another class, and then turned it in as their own work. The teacher and another faculty member had spent many hours investigating the situation and were able to conclusively prove the theft. The teacher told the students that he could not accept the programs, and gave the students an opportunity to make up the work within a limited time frame. Here is how the three students handled the situation : 1. Student A was embarrassed and apologized for violating the teacher's trust. He worked very hard during the time limit, sacrificing grades in other classes, but was able to turn in a better program than what was originally assigned for the copied program. 2. Student B said nothing, but did not have time to complete the program within the time limit due to pressures from other courses. He accepted the failing grade. He was having difficulty in the course anyway, so eventually dropped the class. 3. Student C did not apologize, but apparently found another program written by a student in a previous year for a different teacher, copied that program and turned it in as his own. The teachers were able to prove this second incident and called for a parent conference. Neither the parent nor the student apologize, but the parent blame the school, claiming that the teachers were at fault for having a system where students can take the "easy way out" by being able to copy work too easily.                                          Question :How should the teachers respond to the parental complaints of student C? if they fail the student, the student will likely be rejected from the Ivy League College and could lose scholarship opportunities. If they bow to the parent's pressure and allow a third try to make up the work, this student will have an affair advantage over student B? ​</h2><br />
                        <p>The student was being too arrogant, he didn't apply any effort to make a</p><p>program of his own even though he was given a second chance. It is not the school's fault that the student was able to copy another student's work. The parent might also be at fault for spoiling the child/student. I believe that the school should not tolerate such disgraceful behaviour from a student and should give him an appropriate punishment.</p><p></p><p>p.s. all of these are just my thoughts and opinions about the scenario. I might be considered too harsh by some people but this is my honest opinion. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. . No Surprises</p><p>This is probably the most important thing to keep in mind throughout the year: Make sure you keep parents apprised of any issues. If you think a student has learning problems and should be tested, don't wait until the entire year has passed before suggesting it. You can often avoid problems at the end of the year if parents have already been made aware of your concerns</p><p></p><p>2.Meet Face-to-Face with Parents</p><p>Invite them in to meet with you rather than trying to resolve a problem over the phone or email. That way, you can show them samples of their child's work or records of attendance. You can also share evidence of the times you discussed the issue with them. In the end, it's usually easier for angry parents to say unpleasant things electronically than in person.</p><p></p><p>3.Listen and Ask Questions</p><p>Shake hands with the parents who come to meet with you and ask them to explain what they're unhappy about. Wait until they finish, and don't interrupt unless you're asking for clarification.</p><p></p><p>4. Try to Find Things You Agree On</p><p>Make sure parents understand that, as the child's teacher, you'd like to see him do better, too. Be clear that your role is not to punish the child at the end of the year for not studying, not handing in work, or being absent. Your role is to figure out how to make their child more successful in the future.</p><p></p><p>5. Don't Allow Yourself to Be Pressured</p><p>A few parents may ask a teacher to change a grade or move their child forward even if he or she hasn't fulfilled the requirements. You, of course, have to adhere to your professional ethics—and you don't want the reputation of someone who can be manipulated by parents. If they want to, parents always have the option to escalate the problem to the principal.</p><p></p><p>6. Know When the Conversation Is Over</p><p>In my experience, once most difficult parents have expressed their unhappiness or anger, you can all can move on to find a workable solution together. Unfortunately, this is not the case with all parents. It's fine for parents to be angry, but it isn't OK for them to be abusive. If that happens and it's clear you're not going to agree, it's time to bring the conversation to a close. They may decide to take their complaint to the principal, and that's fine. That's how the system works.</p><p>During your career, you'll have many meetings with parents. Most of them will be easy, gratifying, and pleasant—but a handful won't be. Knowing how to deal with difficult parents should be part of every teacher's skill set, so you can keep your cool while working to find a resolution that's in the student's best interests.</p><br />
