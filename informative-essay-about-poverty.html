It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, etc. A poor person is not able to get education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A  jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems.According to the Noble prize winner South African leader, Nelson Mandela – “Poverty is not natural, it is manmade”. The above statement is true as the causes of poverty are generally man-made. There are various causes of poverty but the most important is population. Rising population is putting the burden on the resources &amp; budget of countries. Governments are finding difficult to provide food, shelter &amp; employment to the rising population.<p></p>The other causes are- lack of education, war, natural disaster, lack of employment, lack of infrastructure, political instability, etc. For instance- lack of employment opportunities makes a person jobless &amp; he is not able to earn enough to fulfill the basic necessities of his family &amp; becomes poor. Lack of education compels a person for less paying jobs &amp; it makes him poorer. Lack of infrastructure means there are no industries, banks, etc. in a country resulting in lack of employment opportunities. Natural disasters like flood, earthquake also contribute to poverty.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> <strong>hope it helps:) </strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Poverty is a complex issue that is influenced by a variety of factors including culture and society. In many cases, cultural and societal norms perpetuate poverty by creating barriers to access and opportunities. This essay will examine the ways in which culture and society contribute to poverty and what can be done to address these issues.</p><p></p><p>Culture plays a significant role in shaping attitudes and behaviors towards poverty. In some cultures, poverty is seen as a personal failing and a result of laziness or lack of effort. This perspective can lead to stigmatization of those living in poverty and create a cycle of shame and isolation. On the other hand, some cultures view poverty as a structural issue and believe that everyone has a responsibility to support those in need. These cultural differences can impact policy decisions and shape the way in which poverty is addressed.</p><p></p><p>Society also plays a role in perpetuating poverty. In many cases, societal systems and structures create barriers to access and opportunities for those living in poverty. For example, inadequate education and job training programs can limit the ability of individuals to find stable employment and improve their economic status. Additionally, discriminatory practices in housing, healthcare, and the justice system can further marginalize those living in poverty.</p><p></p><p>In order to address poverty, it is important to examine the ways in which culture and society contribute to the issue. One approach is to shift cultural attitudes towards poverty by promoting empathy and understanding. This can be achieved through education campaigns and public messaging that challenges negative stereotypes and promotes a culture of compassion.</p><p></p><p>On a societal level, policies and programs must be put in place to remove barriers to access and opportunities for those living in poverty. This can include investing in education and job training programs, providing affordable housing and healthcare, and reforming discriminatory practices within the justice system.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, poverty is a complex issue that is shaped by cultural and societal factors. It is important to address these underlying causes in order to create lasting change and improve the lives of those living in poverty. By promoting a culture of empathy and implementing policies that remove barriers to access and opportunities, we can work towards a more equitable and just society for all.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"Poverty is the worst form of violence”. – Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p></p><p>We can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, etc. A poor person is not able to get education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A  jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems.</p><p></p><p>How Poverty is Measured?</p><p></p><p>For measuring poverty United nations have devised two measures of poverty – Absolute &amp; relative poverty.  Absolute poverty is used to measure poverty in developing countries like India. Relative poverty is used to measure poverty in developed countries like the USA. In absolute poverty, a line based on the minimum level of income has been created &amp; is called a poverty line.  If per day income of a family is below this level, then it is poor or below the poverty line. If per day income of a family is above this level, then it is non-poor or above the poverty line. In India, the new poverty line is  Rs 32 in rural areas and Rs 47 in urban areas.</p><p></p><p>Causes of Poverty</p><p></p><p>According to the Noble prize winner South African leader, Nelson Mandela – “Poverty is not natural, it is manmade”. The above statement is true as the causes of poverty are generally man-made. There are various causes of poverty but the most important is population. Rising population is putting the burden on the resources &amp; budget of countries. Governments are finding difficult to provide food, shelter &amp; employment to the rising population.</p><p></p><p>The other causes are- lack of education, war, natural disaster, lack of employment, lack of infrastructure, political instability, etc. For instance- lack of employment opportunities makes a person jobless &amp; he is not able to earn enough to fulfill the basic necessities of his family &amp; becomes poor. Lack of education compels a person for less paying jobs &amp; it makes him poorer. Lack of infrastructure means there are no industries, banks, etc. in a country resulting in lack of employment opportunities. Natural disasters like flood, earthquake also contribute to poverty.</p><p></p><p>In some countries, especially African countries like Somalia, a long period of civil war has made poverty widespread. This is because all the resources &amp; money is being spent in war instead of public welfare. Countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc. are prone to natural disasters like cyclone, etc. These disasters occur every year causing poverty to rise.</p><p></p><p>Ill Effects of Poverty</p><p></p><p>Poverty affects the life of a poor family. A poor person is not able to take proper food &amp; nutrition &amp;his capacity to work reduces. Reduced capacity to work further reduces his income, making him poorer. Children from poor family never get proper schooling &amp; proper nutrition. They have to work to support their family &amp; this destroys their childhood. Some of them may also involve in crimes like theft, murder, robbery, etc. A poor person remains uneducated &amp; is forced to live under unhygienic conditions in slums. There are no proper sanitation &amp; drinking water facility in slums &amp; he falls ill often &amp;  his health deteriorates. A poor person generally dies an early death. So, all social evils are related to poverty.</p><p></p><p>Government Schemes to Remove Poverty</p><p></p><p>The government of India also took several measures to eradicate poverty from India. Some of them are – creating employment opportunities, controlling population, etc. In India, about 60% of the population is still dependent on agriculture for its livelihood. Government has taken certain measures to promote agriculture in India. The government constructed certain dams &amp; canals in our country to provide easy availability of water for irrigation. Government has also taken steps for the cheap availability of seeds &amp; farming equipment to promote agriculture. Government is also promoting farming of cash crops like cotton, instead of food crops. In cities, the government is promoting industrialization to create more jobs. Government has also opened  ‘Ration shops’. Other measures include providing free &amp; compulsory education for children up to 14 years of age, scholarship to deserving students from a poor background, providing subsidized houses to poor people, etc.</p><p></p><p>Poverty is a social evil, we can also contribute to control it. For example- we can simply donate old clothes to poor people, we can also sponsor the education of a poor child or we can utilize our free time by teaching poor students. Remember before wasting food, somebody is still sleeping hungry.</p><p></p><br />

Corruption is a way for the powerful to take advantage of the vulnerable, which can lead to poverty.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Farmers, Fisherfolk, and Individuals Residing in Rural Areas had the highest poverty rates among the basic sectors in 2018, according to the PSA (Philippine Statistics Authority). In my opinion this is due to the lack of sustainable development and negligence by the government in these provincial areas. This is most evident when farmers who are in charge of producing vegetables, fruits, and other plant-based foods are underpaid and exploited by larger companies who resell their products. Individuals living in cities, seniors, migrant workers, and formal sector workers, on the other hand, had the lowest poverty rates among the basic sectors in 2018, at 9.3, 9.1, and 8.8%, respectively. Poverty is still present in more urbanized areas of the country , but it is significantly lower than that experienced by those living in rural areas. Because cities are often more developed, living in one provides more opportunities to earn financially.</p><p></p><br />

also discuss your point of view about the poverty and the possible solution to it
(with statistical information)</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Poverty is a persistent problem in the Philippines, with an estimated 16.7% of the population living below the poverty line as of 2020. This means that more than 17 million Filipinos are struggling to meet their basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare. Poverty is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach, and the government has implemented various programs and initiatives to address this problem.</p><p></p><p>One of the government's primary strategies to alleviate poverty is through its conditional cash transfer program, the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps). The program provides cash grants to poor households, with the condition that their children attend school and receive regular health check-ups. The program has been successful in reducing poverty in some areas of the country, but there are also criticisms that it is not sustainable in the long run and may foster dependency among the beneficiaries.</p><p></p><p>Another government initiative is the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), which aims to distribute land to landless farmers and promote agricultural development. However, the implementation of CARP has been slow and beset with issues such as land conversion and resistance from landowners.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, poverty in the Philippines is a deeply rooted issue that cannot be solved through one program or policy alone. It requires a comprehensive and sustained effort from the government and other stakeholders, including the private sector and civil society organizations. The government should focus on improving access to quality education, healthcare, and basic services such as water and sanitation. It should also promote inclusive economic growth that creates more job opportunities and reduces income inequality.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there should be more emphasis on addressing the root causes of poverty, such as landlessness, lack of access to credit, and social exclusion. This can be done through the implementation of policies that promote rural development, sustainable agriculture, and equitable distribution of resources.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, it is crucial to involve the poor themselves in the design and implementation of poverty reduction programs. They should be empowered to participate in decision-making processes and have access to information and resources that can help them improve their lives.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, poverty is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. While the government has implemented various programs and initiatives to address poverty, more needs to be done to sustainably alleviate poverty in the Philippines. It is crucial to address the root causes of poverty and involve the poor themselves in the process of poverty reduction.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Poverty can be expressed differently from many viewpoints (Spector, 2013). Poverty is characterized by their physical, mental, and spiritual state. Physically, individuals can be affected by the environment or other factors, such as, their lifestyle. Mentally, individuals affected by poverty are not educated or do not have the opportunity for advancement. Spiritually, they find themselves feeling of hopelessness. Poverty can co-exist within many subcultures that reside is particular areas, consider California. In California, there are dense populations that live below the poverty line that is also a part of other subcultures. When income, education, and lifestyles are compromised many health issues can arise. To comeback these harsh lifestyles, many groups have come together to improve and educate people who currently live in poverty. Health educators also manipulate their strategic efforts to have the most impact on the community. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>HOPE</strong><strong> YOU</strong><strong> UNDERSTAND</strong><strong> ❤️</strong></p><br />

You will need to tell how many people are below the poverty line in different parts of America. Consulting official governmental sites is especially helpful in this regard. Make sure you cite all references at the end of the paper.</p><p></p><p>But when people in poverty say that poverty is violence, they are also speaking of the force they feel subjected to when caught in situations of humiliation and injustice.
