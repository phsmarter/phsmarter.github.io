                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>A <strong>claim of policy essay</strong> about natural resources could <strong>argue for specific actions that need to be taken to conserve or manage these resources</strong>. On the other hand, a <strong>claim of value essay</strong> would make an <strong>argument about the inherent worth or importance of natural resources</strong>.</p><p></p>Claim of policy essay:<p>Natural resources are finite and valuable, and it is our responsibility to ensure that they are conserved and managed sustainably for future generations. To achieve this goal, we must take action to reduce waste, protect ecosystems, and promote sustainable development practices.</p><p></p><p>One way to reduce waste is to implement more efficient technologies that use natural resources more judiciously. For example, we can encourage the development of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power to reduce our reliance on non-renewable resources like coal and oil. We can also promote the use of recycled materials to reduce waste and conserve natural resources.</p><p></p><p>To protect ecosystems, we must ensure that human activities do not cause irreversible harm to biodiversity and natural habitats. This requires careful planning and management of land use, as well as the establishment of protected areas and wildlife corridors. Additionally, we must work to mitigate the impact of climate change on ecosystems, which threatens to cause widespread extinction of plant and animal species.</p><p></p><p>Finally, to promote sustainable development practices, we must prioritize the use of natural resources in ways that are equitable and do not harm future generations. This requires a shift in the way we think about economic growth and development, moving away from short-term gains and towards long-term sustainability.</p><p></p>Claim of value essay:<p>Natural resources are invaluable treasures that provide essential services to humanity and support all life on earth. They are the foundation of our existence, providing us with food, water, energy, and materials for shelter, clothing, and medicine. Natural resources also provide recreational and aesthetic value, enriching our lives and connecting us to nature.</p><p></p><p>However, despite their immense value, natural resources are often taken for granted and exploited without regard for their long-term sustainability. This leads to a loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, and depletion of finite resources.</p><p></p><p>It is essential that we recognize and appreciate the inherent value of natural resources, not just in terms of their economic worth but also in terms of their ecological and social importance. We must protect and conserve these resources for their own sake, as well as for the sake of future generations.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, we must shift away from an exploitative and extractive mindset towards a more holistic and sustainable approach to resource management.

They include air, water, sunlight, soil, minerals, plants, and animals. Natural resources are essential for human survival and development. They provide us with food, shelter, clothing, fuel, and other materials necessary for our daily lives.</p><p></p><p>Natural resources are finite in nature; they cannot be replaced once they have been used up or destroyed. This means that it is important to use them responsibly and sustainably so that future generations can benefit from them as well. We must also take steps to protect natural resources from pollution and other forms of degradation. This includes reducing our consumption of natural resources by using renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power instead of fossil fuels. Additionally, we should strive to reduce waste by recycling and reusing materials whenever possible.</p><p></p><p>The conservation of natural resources is essential for the health of our planet and its inhabitants. By taking steps to protect these valuable resources now, we can ensure that future generations will have access to them for years to come.</p><br />

However, there is substantial scientific evidence that supports the claim that the Earth is indeed getting warmer. According to NASA, the average global temperature has increased by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit since the 19th century. This may seem like a small increase, but it has significant implications for our planet.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, research shows that human activities are the primary cause of this warming trend. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which trap heat and contribute to the warming of the Earth.</p><p></p><p>It's important to note that the scientific consensus on this issue is clear. A study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters found that 97% of climate scientists agree that the Earth's temperature is increasing due to human activities.</p><p></p><p>The consequences of global warming are already being felt around the world, with rising sea levels, more frequent heatwaves, and other extreme weather events. Therefore, it is crucial that we take action to reduce our carbon footprint and mitigate the effects of global warming.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the claim that the Earth's temperature is increasing, and that human activities are primarily responsible for this trend, is a fact-based claim that is supported by substantial scientific evidence.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Introduction: </p><p></p><p>Social media has revolutionized the way people communicate with each other, enabling them to share ideas, connect with friends and family, and interact with their favorite brands and celebrities. However, this technological advancement has also brought with it a host of negative effects that have greatly impacted our society. One of the most significant negative effects of social media is its impact on face-to-face communication. In this essay, we will explore the negative effects of social media on face-to-face communication and suggest some ways to reduce these effects.</p><p></p><p>Problem:</p><p></p><p>Social media has made communication easier and more convenient than ever before, but it has also had a detrimental effect on face-to-face communication. The constant need to check our phones, tablets, and laptops for social media notifications has made us distracted and disengaged from the people around us. We have become so accustomed to communicating through screens that we struggle to communicate effectively in person.</p><p></p><p>Cause &amp; Effect:</p><p></p><p>One of the main causes of this problem is the addictive nature of social media. Social media platforms are designed to keep us engaged and coming back for more. This is achieved through a combination of addictive design features, such as infinite scrolling and push notifications, and the use of algorithms that personalize our feeds to keep us interested. This addictive nature of social media can be so overwhelming that it distracts us from face-to-face conversations.</p><p></p><p>Another cause of the problem is the social comparison that social media facilitates. People often present their best selves on social media, and this can lead to unrealistic expectations and feelings of inadequacy. This, in turn, can lead to social anxiety and a lack of confidence in face-to-face interactions.</p><p></p><p>The effect of social media on face-to-face communication is significant. It can lead to a lack of engagement and a sense of disconnection from the people around us. It can also contribute to a decrease in social skills and a lack of confidence in social situations.</p><p></p><p>Claim of Policy:</p><p></p><p>To reduce the negative effects of social media on face-to-face communication, we need to take action. One solution is to limit our social media use. We can set aside specific times of the day to check our social media accounts and turn off notifications during other times. This will help us stay present and engaged in our face-to-face interactions.</p><p></p><p>Another solution is to develop social skills. Social skills are essential for effective face-to-face communication, and they can be improved with practice. We can develop our social skills by attending social events, joining clubs or groups that share our interests, and volunteering in our communities.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, social media has had a significant impact on face-to-face communication, and its negative effects cannot be ignored. However, there are ways to reduce these effects. By limiting our social media use and developing our social skills, we can become more engaged and effective communicators in our face-to-face interactions. Ultimately, the key to reducing the negative effects of social media is to recognize its limitations and to prioritize the relationships that matter most to us.</p><br />

You can power a home for 5 months with the energy you save. Every year, the average household consumes the equivalent of six trees' worth of paper. The EPA believes that 75% of the trash stream in the United States is recyclable, yet we only recycle roughly 30% of it. ... Every year, we produce 21.5 million tons of food waste. Composting that food would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the same amount as removing 2 million cars from the road. They are frequently burnt, disposed of in landfills, or washed into the sea. While waste-to-energy plants have been linked to toxic emissions in the past, incineration is occasionally used to generate energy.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Vaccines work by mimicking an infectious agent – viruses, bacteria or other microorganisms that can cause a disease. This ‘teaches’ our immune system to rapidly and effectively respond against it.<p></p>Traditionally, vaccines have done this by introducing a weakened form of an infectious agent that allows our immune system to build a memory of it. This way, our immune system can quickly recognize and fight it before it makes us ill. That’s how some of the COVID-19 vaccines have been designed.<p></p>Other COVID-19 vaccines have been developed using new approaches, which are called messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines. Instead of introducing antigens (a substance that causes your immune system to produce antibodies), mRNA vaccines give our body the genetic code it needs to allow our immune system to produce the antigen itself. mRNA vaccine technology has been studied for several decades. They contain no live virus and do not interfere with human DNA.<br />

The COVID-19 pandemic is urgent, global in scale, and massive in impacts. Following Harold D. Lasswell’s goal for the policy sciences to offer insights into unfolding phenomena, this commentary draws on the lessons of the policy sciences literature to understand the dynamics related to COVID-19. We explore the ways in which scientific and technical expertise, emotions, and narratives influence policy decisions and shape relationships among citizens, organizations, and governments. We discuss varied processes of adaptation and change, including learning, surges in policy responses, alterations in networks (locally and globally), implementing policies across transboundary issues, and assessing policy success and failure. We conclude by identifying understudied aspects of the policy sciences that deserve attention in the pandemic’s aftermath.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>希望对你有帮助/ Hope it helps you</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When making decisions, it is important to understand the difference between claims, facts, and values. Claims are statements that are used to defend or support an opinion or argument. Facts are statements that can be verified or disproved through evidence. Values are subjective beliefs that are based on an individual or collective judgment of what is important or desirable.</p><p></p><p>Claims are used to express opinions and beliefs that cannot be objectively proven. They often rely on personal experience, and are used to support a certain argument or opinion. For example, one might make the claim that “all students should be required to take at least one foreign language class in order to graduate.” While this claim may be based on personal experience or beliefs, it cannot be objectively proven.</p><p></p><p>Facts are objective pieces of information that can be verified or disproved using evidence. For example, one might make the statement that “the population of the United States is approximately 328 million.” This statement can easily be verified or disproved using reliable sources.</p><p></p><p>Values are subjective beliefs that are based on individual or collective judgments of what is important or desirable. Values are often used to make decisions and inform opinions. For example, one might have the value that “education should be available and accessible to everyone.” This value can be used to make decisions and inform opinions about educational policies and programs. </p><p>Policy  makers often consider both facts and values when making decisions, as both can provide important insight into the potential consequences of a decision. When making decisions, it is important to consider both claims, facts, and values in order to ensure that the best decision is made.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A claim of fact makes an assertion about something that can be proved or disproved with factual evidence. However, keep in mind the basic quality of claims, that they have to be debatable, and offer an assertion about an issue. So a claim of fact for a logical argument cannot simply consist of a statistic or proven fact. It needs, instead, to focus on an assertion which uses facts to back it up, but for which the evidence might still be debatable.</p><p></p><p>Inappropriate claim of fact – a statistic or fact that is not debatable:</p><p></p><p>“the month of March 2017 was 1.03°C (1.9°F) above the 20th century average—this marked the first time the monthly temperature departure from average surpassed 1.0°C (1.8°F) in the absence of an El Niño episode in the tropical Pacific Ocean.” (from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration, NOAA, https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201713 )</p><p></p><p>Appropriate claim of fact – makes a claim that is debatable using factual evidence</p><p></p><p>Decreasing carbon dioxide emissions from car exhaust, manufacturing processes, fertilizers, and landfills, while slowing deforestation, may help slow the process of global warming.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>General damages (injury award)</p><p>This is unlikely to be affected. General damages are assessed in line with the Judicial Studies Board guidelines and on past case law.</p><p></p><p>Loss of Earnings</p><p>If there is going to be an economic downturn it could affect the sector in which the Claimant was working, wanted to work in or was hoping to work in. If their job was going to disappear because of the crisis, they would have lost earnings even if the accident had never happened. That could affect the recoverable loss, both past and future. Would they have been furloughed? Would they have received 80% of their salary or 100%? Much will depend on what their employer did during the crisis.</p><p></p><p>Treatment</p><p>The pandemic is likely to effect individuals access to treatment and therapy. Although some assistance can be offered by video and telephone, hands on therapy remains difficult with social distancing. Responsibility for the Claimants day to day needs are likely to fall on their family, the costs of which are significantly less than professional care.</p><p></p><p>Future losses</p><p>The Courts use the Ogden tables to assess future losses. An annual loss figure is calculated. For example, an injured claimant cannot work or is restricted in their ability to work. As a result, they are losing £10,000 in earnings, or they need help with day to day tasks and employ a carer at a cost of £10,000 per annum. This is known as the multiplicand. That figure is then multiplied by the number of years the loss is expected to last. This is known as the multiplier. The multiplier varies depending on various factors, one of which is life expectancy. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to affect this figure and reduce it.</p><p></p><p>Sadly, deaths from Coronavirus have increased for some of those infected and the crisis has had an impact on access to health services. It will also impact on the social, physical and psychological wellbeing of some individuals, all of which could impact on life expectancy and reduce the multiplier.</p><p></p><p>Only time will tell as to how this impacts on the value of a claim but there are likely to be some interesting arguments going forward.</p><p></p><p>For more information contact John Bennett in our Clinical Negligence department via email or phone on 01254 872111.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Claim: The government should implement a universal basic income program.</p><p></p><p>Value Claim:</p><p></p><p>The idea of a universal basic income (UBI) has been gaining popularity in recent years, and for good reason. A UBI program would provide every citizen with a basic income, regardless of their employment status or income level. While some may argue that this would lead to laziness or a lack of motivation to work, the benefits of a UBI program far outweigh any potential drawbacks.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, a UBI program would help to alleviate poverty and reduce income inequality. Currently, many individuals and families struggle to make ends meet, even while working multiple jobs. A UBI program would provide a safety net for these individuals, allowing them to meet their basic needs and improve their quality of life.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, a UBI program would help to stimulate the economy. By putting money directly into the hands of consumers, it would increase spending and drive demand for goods and services. This, in turn, would lead to job growth and economic expansion.</p><p></p><p>Another benefit of a UBI program is that it would provide individuals with greater freedom and flexibility in their careers. With a guaranteed basic income, individuals would have more options when it comes to choosing the work they want to do. They would be able to pursue careers that align with their passions and interests, rather than being forced to take any job out of necessity.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, a UBI program would help to address the growing issue of automation and job displacement. As technology continues to advance, many jobs are becoming obsolete. A UBI program would provide a safety net for individuals who may lose their jobs due to automation, allowing them to retrain and pursue new careers.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there are concerns that a UBI program would lead to increased taxes and government spending. However, it's important to note that the benefits of a UBI program would far outweigh any potential costs. By reducing poverty, stimulating the economy, and providing individuals with greater freedom and flexibility, a UBI program would create a more equitable and prosperous society for all.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, a UBI program is a necessary step towards creating a more equitable and just society. By providing every citizen with a basic income, we can alleviate poverty, stimulate the economy, and provide individuals with greater freedom and flexibility in their careers. It's time for the government to take action and implement a UBI program that works for all.</p><br />
