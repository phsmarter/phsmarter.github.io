Both cities are rich in world and national history, though they developed on very different time lines. London, for example, has a history that dates back over two thousand years. It was part of the Roman Empire and known by the similar name, Londinium. It was not only one of the northernmost points of the Roman Em- pire but also the epicenter of the British Empire where it held significant global influence from the early sixteenth century on through the early twentieth century. Washington, DC, on the other hand, has only formally existed since the late eighteenth century. Though Native Americans inhabited the land several thousand years earlier, and settlers inhabited the land as early as the six- teenth century, the city did not become the capital of the United States until the 1790s. From that point onward to today, however, Washington, DC, has increasingly maintained significant global influence. Even though both cities have different histories, they have both held, and continue to hold, significant social influence in the economic and cultural global spheres.as well as a similar amount of global and national chains. While London may be better known for its pubs and taste in beer, DC offers a different bar-going experience. With clubs and pubs that tend to stay open later than their British counterparts, the DC night life tend to be less reserved overall. ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Many currently available drugs show unfavourable physicochemical properties for delivery into or across the skin and temporary chemical modulation of the penetrant is one option to achieve improved delivery properties. Pro-drugs are chemical derivatives of an active drug which is covalently bonded to an inactive pro-moiety in order to overcome pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic barriers. A pro-drug relies upon conversion within the body to release the parent active drug (and pro-moiety) to elicit its pharmacological effect. The main drawback of this approach is that the pro-moiety is essentially an unwanted ballast which, when released, can lead to adverse effects. The term 'co-drug' refers to two or more therapeutic compounds active against the same disease bonded via a covalent chemical linkage and it is this approach which is reviewed for the first time in the current article. For topically applied co-drugs, each moiety is liberated in situ, either chemically or enzymatically, once the stratum corneum barrier has been overcome by the co-drug. Advantages include synergistic modulation of the disease process, enhancement of drug delivery and pharmacokinetic properties and the potential to enhance stability by masking of labile functional groups. The amount of published work on co-drugs is limited but the available data suggest the co-drug concept could provide a significant therapeutic improvement in dermatological diseases. However, the applicability of the co-drug approach is subject to strict limitations pertaining mainly to the availability of compatible moieties and physicochemical properties of the overall molecule.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>i i hope i can help </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The essence of art in today's society is multifaceted and can vary depending on the context and perspective. </p><p></p><p>2. It is important to walk through the arts in history and arts through the ages for several reasons. Firstly, art is a reflection of society and culture, and therefore, studying the art of different time periods and regions can provide insights into the values, beliefs, and practices of those societies. This can help us to better understand the historical context in which art was created and appreciate its significance.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, studying art through the ages can help us to trace the development and evolution of different artistic movements, styles, and techniques. This can provide us with a better understanding of how art has changed and adapted over time, and how it has been influenced by various factors such as politics, religion, and technology.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, by understanding the artistic practices and traditions of the past, contemporary artists can draw inspiration from historical sources and engage in a dialogue with the past. This can help to create a deeper understanding of contemporary art, and the connections and influences that exist between contemporary art and the art of the past.</p><p></p><p>In short, by studying the arts in history and arts through the ages, we can gain a deeper appreciation and understanding of art, and its significance in both historical and contemporary contexts. This can help us to better appreciate and engage with contemporary art, and to understand the ways in which it is both shaped by and in conversation with the past.</p><p></p><p>3. Traditional art and contemporary art are two broad categories of art that differ in various ways. Here are some comparisons between the two:</p><p></p><p>1. Historical context: Traditional art is usually associated with historical or cultural traditions, whereas contemporary art is often seen as breaking away from these traditions and exploring new forms of expression.</p><p></p><p>Example: Traditional Japanese woodblock prints, such as the works of Hokusai or Hiroshige, are known for their detailed imagery and connection to Japanese culture and history. On the other hand, contemporary Japanese artist Takashi Murakami's works often blend traditional and modern elements to create bold and colorful images that reflect contemporary pop culture.</p><p></p><p>2. Materials and techniques: Traditional art often uses specific materials and techniques that have been used for centuries, whereas contemporary art often incorporates new materials and technology.</p><p></p><p>Example: Traditional Chinese calligraphy uses brushes, ink, and rice paper, and emphasizes the importance of mastery and discipline in technique. In contrast, contemporary artist Xu Bing's installation "Book from the Sky" features scrolls of Chinese text that are actually meaningless, and are created using a specially designed printer and characters that he invented himself.</p><p></p><p>3. Purpose and meaning: Traditional art often has specific meanings or functions within a cultural context, whereas contemporary art often challenges traditional notions of meaning and interpretation.</p><p></p><p>Example: Traditional African masks were often used in rituals and ceremonies to communicate with the spirit world, and were made from natural materials such as wood, animal skins, and beads. In contrast, contemporary South African artist William Kentridge's works often deal with themes of apartheid and social justice, and use a variety of media such as film, drawing, and sculpture to create thought-provoking narratives.</p><br />

ACTIVITY 2 DIRECTIONS: Using the Venn diagram, compare and contrast Washington DC and London.Both Washington, DC, and London are capital cities of English-speaking countries, and yet they offer vastly different experiences to their residents and visitors. Comparing and contrasting the two cities based on their history, their culture, and their residents show how different and similar the two are. Both cities are rich in world and national history, though they developed on very different time lines. London, for example, has a history that dates back over two thousand years. It was part of the Roman Empire and known by the similar name, Londinium. It was not only one of the northernmost points of the Roman Em- pire but also the epicenter of the British Empire where it held significant global influence from the early sixteenth century on through the early twentieth century. Washington, DC, on the other hand, has only formally existed since the late eighteenth century. Though Native Americans inhabited the land several thousand years earlier, and settlers inhabited the land as early as the six- teenth century, the city did not become the capital of the United States until the 1790s. From that point onward to today, however, Washington, DC, has increasingly maintained significant global influence. Even though both cities have different histories, they have both held, and continue to hold, significant social influence in the economic and cultural global spheres.as well as a similar amount of global and national chains. While London may be better known for its pubs and taste in beer, DC offers a different bar-going experience. With clubs and pubs that tend to stay open later than their British counterparts, the DC night life tend to be less reserved overall. ​</h2><br />
