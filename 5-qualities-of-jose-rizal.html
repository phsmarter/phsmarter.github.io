                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Christopher Reeves commented, “Anyone can give up, it’s the easiest thing to do. But to hold it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart, that’s true strength.” Heroes keep on working until they accomplish their goal to make a difference in others' lives. They should have compassion, perseverance, confidence, and they should be selfless, strong, and fair. They can be either someone you know personally or famous people who are admired as role models. Jose Rizal is a famous hero in the Philippines.</p><br />

Respect for women</p><p></p><p>Given his reputation of having paramours, his respect for women is not limited only for romantic purposes but he generally respects women during a time that they are oppressed.
