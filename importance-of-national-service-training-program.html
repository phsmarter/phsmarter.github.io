It would be in the best interest of the country if President Marcos appoints a “permanent” Department of Health secretary, especially since the World Health Organization warned of the emergence of new, deadlier variants of the COVID-19 virus, according to a congressman.“A permanent DOH chief is needed to lead the country in the race for world-class health care,” House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan said, noting that Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire was just designated as “officer-in-charge.”The leader of the 28-member official opposition bloc in the House of Representatives also observed that it has been nearly six months since Marcos took over the reins of power in June 30, but that he has “not nominated” any health secretary yet.The DOH portfolio is very important, even as Libanan prefers that national government “quickly modernize the country’s health care system, and position the Philippines as a global medical hub just like Singapore.”“We should aspire to be like Singapore, which receives more than 160,000 foreign patients who undergo over 70 kinds of medical treatments or procedures every year,” the congressman from party-list 4Ps said.“In fact, a growing number of wealthy Filipinos are already flying to Singapore just to seek medical treatment,” Libanan pointed out.The House leader believes the “Philippines has all the assets needed – including highly trained physicians, nurses, medical technologists and pharmacists – to advance as an international medical center for foreign patients looking for world-class health care.”“In fact, Filipino health care professionals are also admired around the world as the most caring. We have to capitalize on this,” Libanan stressed.“This is not just about medical tourism. This is also about providing every Filipino, rich or poor, access to world-class medical treatment services through our public health system,” he said.At the same time, Libanan called for effective public-private partnerships to put the Philippines at the forefront of medical developments.“We must also develop complimentary medical research and education capacities through international collaborations,” he proposed. “If necessary, Congress should provide tax incentives to lure new international medical schools and research facilities to operate here.”Libanan likewise pressed for a multi-year program to simultaneously modernize the UP-Philippine General Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, and the Lung Center of the Philippines, among others.​</a>

                                            In my own understanding, The Armed Forces of the Philippines is know as one of the highest rank in society. This duty is to maintain the peace of our country and to perform kindness for those who needs. Defending the country in some criminals, terrorism and other who try steal our territory and they Give us the peace, justice and harmony, they trains us how to respect by obeying them when they are in our front nor in the back. Responsible for Guard in any areas for sure there is no accident or any cases. Equipment’s is not a problem in AFP because they are providing much of it, so that this country can fight for sought justice. Supported by the government is a big help to maintain the ground forces because we don’t know when or where is having a war. Over the years, the AFP Reserve Force has been an important component to the defense force and therefore the whole country delivering essential contributions to defense, development and security. Members of the reserve force are highly valued for his or her role in safeguarding the safety of the state, for his or her assistance in socio-economic development, their support in rescue and relief during calamities and disasters, their functions and services in times of emergencies, and to help within the operation and maintenance of essential government or private utilities within the furtherance of its overall mission.

It would be in the best interest of the country if President Marcos appoints a “permanent” Department of Health secretary, especially since the World Health Organization warned of the emergence of new, deadlier variants of the COVID-19 virus, according to a congressman. “A permanent DOH chief is needed to lead the country in the race for world-class health care,” House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan said, noting that Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire was just designated as “officer-in-charge.”The leader of the 28-member official opposition bloc in the House of Representatives also observed that it has been nearly six months since Marcos took over the reins of power in June 30, but that he has “not nominated” any health secretary yet. The DOH portfolio is very important, even as Libanan prefers that national government “quickly modernize the country’s health care system, and position the Philippines as a global medical hub just like Singapore.”“We should aspire to be like Singapore, which receives more than 160,000 foreign patients who undergo over 70 kinds of medical treatments or procedures every year,” the congressman from party-list 4Ps said. “In fact, a growing number of wealthy Filipinos are already flying to Singapore just to seek medical treatment,” Libanan pointed out. The House leader believes the “Philippines has all the assets needed – including highly trained physicians, nurses, medical technologists and pharmacists – to advance as an international medical center for foreign patients looking for world-class health care.” “In fact, Filipino health care professionals are also admired around the world as the most caring. We have to capitalize on this,” Libanan stressed. “This is not just about medical tourism. This is also about providing every Filipino, rich or poor, access to world-class medical treatment services through our public health system,” he said. At the same time, Libanan called for effective public-private partnerships to put the Philippines at the forefront of medical developments. “We must also develop complimentary medical research and education capacities through international collaborations,” he proposed. “If necessary, Congress should provide tax incentives to lure new international medical schools and research facilities to operate here.”Libanan likewise pressed for a multi-year program to simultaneously modernize the UP-Philippine General Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, and the Lung Center of the Philippines, among others.​</a>

The DOH portfolio is very important, even as Libanan prefers that national government “quickly modernize the country’s health care system, and position the Philippines as a global medical hub just like Singapore.”“We should aspire to be like Singapore, which receives more than 160,000 foreign patients who undergo over 70 kinds of medical treatments or procedures every year,” the congressman from party-list 4Ps said. “In fact, a growing number of wealthy Filipinos are already flying to Singapore just to seek medical treatment,” Libanan pointed out. The House leader believes the “Philippines has all the assets needed – including highly trained physicians, nurses, medical technologists and pharmacists – to advance as an international medical center for foreign patients looking for world-class health care.” “In fact, Filipino health care professionals are also admired around the world as the most caring. We have to capitalize on this,” Libanan stressed. “This is not just about medical tourism. This is also about providing every Filipino, rich or poor, access to world-class medical treatment services through our public health system,” he said. At the same time, Libanan called for effective public-private partnerships to put the Philippines at the forefront of medical developments. “We must also develop complimentary medical research and education capacities through international collaborations,” he proposed. “If necessary, Congress should provide tax incentives to lure new international medical schools and research facilities to operate here.”Libanan likewise pressed for a multi-year program to simultaneously modernize the UP-Philippine General Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, and the Lung Center of the Philippines, among others.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan has urged President Marcos to appoint a permanent Department of Health (DOH) secretary. Libanan believes that this is necessary in order to lead the country in its fight against the COVID-19 virus and its potential new, deadlier variants. He noted that Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire is currently only serving as "officer-in-charge" of the DOH. Libanan also believes that the Philippines has the potential to become a global medical hub like Singapore. He called for effective public-private partnerships and tax incentives to attract international medical schools and research facilities to the country.<p></p><br />
