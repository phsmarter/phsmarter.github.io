[Essay]</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>Science has shown that climate change touches every corner of our planet’s ecosystem, and the water cycle is no exception. Because the processes involved are highly dependent on temperature, changes in one have consequences on the other. Specifically, as global temperatures have steadily increased at their fastest rates in millions of years, it’s directly affected things like water vapor concentrations, clouds, precipitation patterns, and stream flow patterns, which are all related to the water cycle.</p><p></p><p>So how does climate change impact the water cycle? We’ve created an infographic below that illustrates what’s going on, but we’ll describe it here too. Put simply, water evaporates from the land and sea, which eventually returns to Earth as rain and snow. Climate change intensifies this cycle because as air temperatures increase, more water evaporates into the air. Warmer air can hold more water vapor, which can lead to more intense rainstorms, causing major problems like extreme flooding in coastal communities around the world.</p><p></p><p>But it doesn’t end there. At the same time that some areas are experiencing stronger storms, others are experiencing more dry air and even drought. Like we mentioned above, as temperatures rise, evaporation increases and soils dry out. Then when rain does come, much of the water runs off the hard ground into rivers and streams, and the soil remains dry. The result? Still more evaporation from the soil and an increased risk of drought.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

NARRATIVE TEXT Purpose: Essentially, the purpose of narrative text is to tell a story. That said, there can be many reasons for story telling in the first place, for example, myths can be told to explain natural phenomena and legends can be used to pass on cultural beliefs. Storytelling itself is a means to entertain and inform readers and allows for the writer to express themselves creatively and imaginatively. There are many types of narrative text, including myths, fables, traditional tales, novels, short stories etc. 2. EXPLANATORY TEXT Purpose: It moves beyond providing straightforward descriptions to looking at things like causes and reasons. They move beyond a retelling of what happened such as in a simple report, to address the why and how of what happened. 3. EXPOSITORY TEXT Purpose: It exists to provide facts in a way that is educational and purposeful.The text is fact-based with the purpose of exposing the truth through a reliable source. It focuses on educating its reader. Its purpose is not primarily to amuse, but to enlighten and instruct. The objective is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. 4. Factual/Personal Recount Purpose: Recounts focus on retelling events and are generally intended to inform and/or entertain. 5. Persuasive Text Purpose: Its purpose is to convince the reader of the merits of adopting a particular viewpoint or taking a specific course of action ​</h2><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>﻿Energy from the sun drives the water cycle. (Remember energy must be added to liquid water to cause it to evaporate). Liquid water on or slightly below the Earth's surface evaporates into the air, becoming the gas water vapor. Close to 90% of the water vapor in the atmosphere evaporated from the oceans and to a much smaller degree from lakes. Water is also evaporated from the land surface (out of soils) or transpired by plants. These processes on land are often lumped together and called evapotranspiration. Thus, the dominant process near the Earth's surface is evaporation (liquid to gas), acts to remove energy from the Earth's surface. Rising air currents carry water vapor up into the atmosphere, which cools the air, causing the water vapor to condense into tiny droplets of liquid water (or tiny ice crystals), forming clouds. This process, condensation (gas to liquid), releases energy up in the atmosphere where clouds form. In fact the water cycle transports energy ... removing it from the surface via evaporation and delivering it in the middle and upper troposphere where clouds form. When cloud droplets grow large enough they fall to the surface as precipitation. Much of the water on the surface of the Earth collects in the oceans, but it can also be stored as groundwater or ice. Eventually it evaporates again to again move through the water cycle.</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>﻿hope it's help</p><br />

Their main enemy is humans. Humans kill them for their fur and destroy their habitats. In conclusion, tigers are very fascinating and beautiful animals. Their habits, physical traits, and way of living make them very interesting animals to study and learn about. Since they are endangered, it is important to learn more about them and to find ways to help their population.
