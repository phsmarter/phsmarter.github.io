                                            PUT YOURSELF IN PERSPECTIVE You do what you feel good about, which you think is the right thing you believe in and where you get your strength from. You do it for yourself, is that selfish? No, because you live your own life. As long as you do everything from your heart, your feeling and your passion, you are doing well. Your intentions are pure, because as long as you make your own choices and act from your feeling, passion and compassion, you do not hurt anyone, do you? In everything you do and in everything you say people can express themselves angry, disappointed or jealous. Perhaps this is because they are disappointed that you think of yourself for once, instead of putting yourself aside. Maybe it is because they would rather see you go down than you are doing well. And maybe they are scared, afraid they can not make the same choices or can not achieve the same as you. But does that entitle them to attack you and take away your security? No absolutely not. Of course they may have their feelings, and may they speak out. But an act out of jealousy, envy or despair is not good for anyone. Instead of hurling someone, hurting someone by your own sense of despair or uncertainties, first try to observe, try to read a lesson. Try to be happy for someone else, give someone his luck and see it as an example. We are not competitors, we can help each other. We can support each other. We can listen to each other, and see each other and hear each other. Doesn't it make you much happier when you are awarded? Because it is awarded to you. It is up to you, you find happiness in yourself. Focus on yourself and let others inspire you. Instead of bringing them down, help them up and help yourself.

                                            identify whether the speech below is memorized, extemporaneous or impromptu.1. My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2. "So I'd like you all to charge your glasses and join me in toasting the new Mr and Mrs Brown! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom" "Wishing them all the health, wealth and happiness in the world, I'd like you all to join me in toasting the happy couple3. I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my careerand wnat will l'become? As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4. On behalf of the Government of Vietnam, I would like to convey my warmest welcome to all distinguished delegates and guests attending the Vietnam Business Summit on the occasion of the 2017 APEC Economic Leaders' Week. May I extend my warmest greetings to all distinguished guests and delegations, representatives from organizations and enterprises, experts and investors Vietnamese and international alike.​</a>

I've been on the Mountaintop by: Dr. Martin Luther The world is changing and anyone who thinks he can live alone in this world is sleeping through a revolution... We must learn to live together as brothers or we shall perish together as fools. Racial injustice is still the black man's burden and the white man's shame. The government must certainly share the guilt, the individual must share the guilt, and even the church must share the guilt. I have been receiving threats on my life...or warnings about what would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers. I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop, and I no longer mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life; longevity has its grace. But I am not concemed about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He has allowed me to go up to the mountain." And I've looked over, sand I've seen the promised land." I may not get there with you, but I want you to know that we, as a people, will get to that promised land.: I am not worried about anything. I am not fearing any man.

                                            Speech About Friendship Have you ever noticed that when a friend is happy you find yourself happy too, even when it has nothing to do with you? A true friend is like a mirror. Do you know why ? its because they reflect yourself. When I say that, I mean by emotionally, spiritually and much more. When you're happy, they're happy and when you're sad, they're feeling pretty much the same way you're feeling too. People nowadays, in this modern life have lost sight of what a true friendship and love is. Friends do not have to be exactly the same, I mean, friends do have similarities but they also have their differences. The key to opening up the world of friendship is not just to focus on the similarities but to accept each other's faults because true friends do not judge each other. Friends love unconditionally. They do have their little angry long moments from time to time but at the end of the day all is forgiven and forgotten. True friends are very rare to find but once you've found them, don't let them go because not everyone has true friends even if they're popular and famous. I hope all of you as my audience get the true meaning of friends because it's wonderful to be with such amazing friends. A B. Type of Speech (2 points each) 1. 5. 1. 5. 6. 2 6.

Theme is the meaning or concept left to the readers after reading a piece of fiction. A theme usually depicts and unifies the central topic of the story. It gives the reader a deeper significance of the work to people's day to day lives. Moral/lesson of the story is not the theme of the story. Theme is the author's way of sharing ideas, perceptions, and feelings with readers, and it may be directly stated or it may only be implied. The theme unifies the concept of the story. It must adhere to the following requirements: 1. The theme must account all the major details of the story. 2. The theme must not be contradicted by any detail of the story. 3. It must not only rely on supposed facts- facts not actually stated or clearly implied by the story. Furthermore, let us take time and consider some suggestions in creating a theme of a work of literature by Laurence and Thomas Arp, 1993. 1. Theme should be expressed in a statement form having a subject and predicate. 2. Theme must be stated as a generalization about life. 3. Do not make the generalization larger (or smaller) than is justified by the terms of the story. 4. Theme unifies the concept of a story. Therefore, a theme accounts all the major details of the story, it is not contradicted by any detail of a story and it does not rely upon supposed facts. 5. There is no single way of stating a theme. 6. Avoid using statement that reduces the theme to some familiar saying, proverb, or axiom. HOME BASED ACTIVITIES TASK 1: CHARACTER SKETCH BE LIKE!

                                            I Shall Return; by Claude McKay 
I shall return again; I shall return
To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes
At golden noon the forest fires burn,
Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies.
I shall return to loiter by the streams
That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses,
And realize once more my thousand dreams
Of waters rushing down the mountain passes.
I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife
Of village dances, dear delicious tunes
That stir the hidden depths of native life,
Stray melodies of dim remembered runes.
I shall return, I shall return again,
To ease my mind of long, long years of pain.

No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort.

                                            Gettysburg AddressBy Abraham Lincoln1Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.2Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. 3We are met on a great battle-field of that war. 4We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that nation might live. 5It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.6But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate -- we cannot consecrate -- we cannot hallow -- this ground. 7The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. 8The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. 9It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. 10It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth./************/1.

                            4. PUT YOURSELF IN PERSPECTIVE You do what you feel good about, which you think is the right thing you believe in and where you get your strength from. You do it for yourself, is that selfish? No, because you live your own life. As long as you do everything from your heart, your feeling and your passion, you are doing well. Your intentions are pure, because as long as you make your own choices and act from your feeling, passion and compassion, you do not hurt anyone, do you? In everything you do and in everything you say people can express themselves angry, disappointed or jealous. Perhaps this is because they are disappointed that you think of yourself for once, instead of putting yourself aside. Maybe it is because they would rather see you go down than you are doing well. And maybe they are scared, afraid they can not make the same choices or can not achieve the same as you. But does that entitle them to attack you and take away your security? No absolutely not. Of course they may have their feelings, and may they speak out. But an act out of jealousy, envy or despair is not good for anyone. Instead of hurling someone, hurting someone by your own sense of despair or uncertainties, first try to observe, try to read a lesson. Try to be happy for someone else, give someone his luck and see it as an example. We are not competitors, we can help each other. We can support each other. We can listen to each other, and see each other and hear each other. Doesn't it make you much happier when you are awarded? Because it is awarded to you. It is up to you, you find happiness in yourself. Focus on yourself and let others inspire you. Instead of bringing them down, help them up and help yourself.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>INTRODUCTION: </strong>Good day, everyone. Today, I would like to talk to you about something that is very important to me, and that is the power of self-expression and self-care. We often hear people say that taking care of yourself is selfish, but I firmly believe that it is not. In fact, I believe that when we are true to ourselves, we are doing the right thing, and we are not hurting anyone in the process.</p><p></p><p>You do what you feel good about, which you think is the right thing you believe in and where you get your strength from.

We can support each other. We can listen to each other, and see each other and hear each other. Our happiness is in our own hands, and we should never let anyone take it away from us. Remember, it's not selfish to take care of yourself, it's necessary. And when you do, it will inspire others to do the same.

                            5. identify whether the speech below is memorized, extemporaneous or impromptu.1. My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2. "So I'd like you all to charge your glasses and join me in toasting the new Mr and Mrs Brown! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom" "Wishing them all the health, wealth and happiness in the world, I'd like you all to join me in toasting the happy couple3. I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my careerand wnat will l'become? As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4. On behalf of the Government of Vietnam, I would like to convey my warmest welcome to all distinguished delegates and guests attending the Vietnam Business Summit on the occasion of the 2017 APEC Economic Leaders' Week. May I extend my warmest greetings to all distinguished guests and delegations, representatives from organizations and enterprises, experts and investors Vietnamese and international alike.​</h2><br />

                            6. Directions: Study the speech below, and list down the positive and negative messages it contains. Use the table below for your answers. I've been on the Mountaintop by: Dr. Martin Luther The world is changing and anyone who thinks he can live alone in this world is sleeping through a revolution... We must learn to live together as brothers or we shall perish together as fools. Racial injustice is still the black man's burden and the white man's shame. The government must certainly share the guilt, the individual must share the guilt, and even the church must share the guilt. I have been receiving threats on my life...or warnings about what would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers. I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop, and I no longer mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life; longevity has its grace. But I am not concemed about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He has allowed me to go up to the mountain." And I've looked over, sand I've seen the promised land." I may not get there with you, but I want you to know that we, as a people, will get to that promised land.: I am not worried about anything. I am not fearing any man.

                            7. Speech About Friendship Have you ever noticed that when a friend is happy you find yourself happy too, even when it has nothing to do with you? A true friend is like a mirror. Do you know why ? its because they reflect yourself. When I say that, I mean by emotionally, spiritually and much more. When you're happy, they're happy and when you're sad, they're feeling pretty much the same way you're feeling too. People nowadays, in this modern life have lost sight of what a true friendship and love is. Friends do not have to be exactly the same, I mean, friends do have similarities but they also have their differences. The key to opening up the world of friendship is not just to focus on the similarities but to accept each other's faults because true friends do not judge each other. Friends love unconditionally. They do have their little angry long moments from time to time but at the end of the day all is forgiven and forgotten. True friends are very rare to find but once you've found them, don't let them go because not everyone has true friends even if they're popular and famous. I hope all of you as my audience get the true meaning of friends because it's wonderful to be with such amazing friends. A B. Type of Speech (2 points each) 1. 5. 1. 5. 6. 2 6.

                            18. vainly to warn Snow White, knowing what will happen when she bites into the apple. This shows dramatic irony. G. Theme. Theme is the meaning or concept left to the readers after reading a piece of fiction. A theme usually depicts and unifies the central topic of the story. It gives the reader a deeper significance of the work to people's day to day lives. Moral/lesson of the story is not the theme of the story. Theme is the author's way of sharing ideas, perceptions, and feelings with readers, and it may be directly stated or it may only be implied. The theme unifies the concept of the story. It must adhere to the following requirements: 1. The theme must account all the major details of the story. 2. The theme must not be contradicted by any detail of the story. 3. It must not only rely on supposed facts- facts not actually stated or clearly implied by the story. Furthermore, let us take time and consider some suggestions in creating a theme of a work of literature by Laurence and Thomas Arp, 1993. 1. Theme should be expressed in a statement form having a subject and predicate. 2. Theme must be stated as a generalization about life. 3. Do not make the generalization larger (or smaller) than is justified by the terms of the story. 4. Theme unifies the concept of a story. Therefore, a theme accounts all the major details of the story, it is not contradicted by any detail of a story and it does not rely upon supposed facts. 5. There is no single way of stating a theme. 6. Avoid using statement that reduces the theme to some familiar saying, proverb, or axiom. HOME BASED ACTIVITIES TASK 1: CHARACTER SKETCH BE LIKE!

                            21. I Shall Return; by Claude McKay 
I shall return again; I shall return
To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes
At golden noon the forest fires burn,
Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies.
I shall return to loiter by the streams
That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses,
And realize once more my thousand dreams
Of waters rushing down the mountain passes.
I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife
Of village dances, dear delicious tunes
That stir the hidden depths of native life,
Stray melodies of dim remembered runes.
I shall return, I shall return again,
To ease my mind of long, long years of pain.
1. Describe the persona. What is he or she yearning for?
2. How does the poem describe the land of Africa? What does this imply about the feelings
of the persona?
3. What figures of speech are present in the poem? What do they mean?
4. What is the overall theme and message of the poem?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.  The persona in the poem is a person who is longing to return to Africa, their homeland. The persona misses the beauty and culture of Africa, and yearns to experience it again.</p><p></p><p>2.  The poem describes Africa as a place of natural beauty, with forests, streams, and mountain passes. The persona fondly remembers the sounds of village dances and the music of the fiddle and fife. This implies that the persona has strong feelings of nostalgia and longing for their homeland.</p><p></p><p>3.  The poem contains several figures of speech, including personification (the forest fires "burn"), metaphor (the "sapphire skies"), and imagery (the "brown blades of the bending grasses"). These figures of speech help to create a vivid and evocative picture of Africa in the reader's mind, and convey the persona's strong feelings of longing for their homeland.</p><p></p><p>4.  The overall theme of the poem is the longing for home and the desire to return to one's roots. The persona speaks of their desire to experience the beauty and culture of Africa once again, and the poem suggests that this longing is driven by a sense of nostalgia and a desire to reconnect with one's heritage. The message of the poem is that our roots and our sense of belonging are important to us, and that we may yearn to return to the places that hold special meaning to us.</p><p></p><br />

                            28. Gettysburg AddressBy Abraham Lincoln1Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.2Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. 3We are met on a great battle-field of that war. 4We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that nation might live. 5It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.6But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate -- we cannot consecrate -- we cannot hallow -- this ground. 7The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. 8The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. 9It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. 10It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth./************/1.
