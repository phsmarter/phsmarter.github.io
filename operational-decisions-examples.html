There are several reasons why so many people attend theOlympic games or watch them on television. One reason istradition. The name Olympics and the torch and flame remindpeople of the ancient games. People can escape the ordinariness ofdaily life by attending or watching the Olympics. They like toidentify with someone else’s individual sacrifice andaccomplishment. National pride is another reason, and an athlete’sor a team’s hard-earned victory becomes a nation’s victory. Thereare national medal counts and people keep track of how manymedals their country’s athletes have won.2. One problem with the modern Olympics is that it has becomevery big and expensive to operate. The city or country that hoststhe games often loses a lot of money. A stadium, pools, andplaying fields must be built for the athletic events and housing isneeded for the athletes who come from around the world. And allof these facilities are used for only two weeks! In 1984 LosAngeles solved these problems by charging a fee for companieswho wanted to be official sponsors of the games. Companies likeMcDonald’s paid a lot of money to be part of the Olympics. Manybuildings that were already built in Los Angeles area were alsoused. The coliseum where the 1932 games were held was usedagain and many colleges and universities in the area becameplaying and living areas.3.

About one in ten people has a significant phobia,although few people seek treatment.4. “Mom, I believe that it is very necessary for me to have my owntablet,” Keisha said persuasively.

One problem with the modern Olympics is that it has becomevery big and expensive to operate. The city or country that hoststhe games often loses a lot of money. A stadium, pools, andplaying fields must be built for the athletic events and housing isneeded for the athletes who come from around the world. And all ofthese facilities are used for only two weeks! In 1984 Los Angelessolved these problems by charging a fee for companies whowanted to be official sponsors of the games. Companies likeMcDonald’s paid a lot of money to be part of the Olympics. Manybuildings that were already built in Los Angeles area were alsoused. The coliseum where the 1932 games were held was usedagain and many colleges and universities in the area became playing and living areas.3.

                                            Going Green Can Be Good for the Bottom LineBy Yevgenia NaybergSource: https://insighf.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/going-green-can-be-good-for-the-bottom-lineThese days, almost every company supports the idea of a greener planet. Most acknowledge the ethical case for building supply chains that conserve energy and cause less environmental damage.At the December 2015 Paris Climate Conference, nearly every nation in the world announced their plans to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions. In the coming years new national climate policies will inevitably shift how businessesoperate.Thesoonercompaniesaligntheiroperationswiththistrend,thebettertheywilldoatturning the challenge of growing while reducing emissions into a competitiveadvantage.But according to Ozge Islegen, an assistant professor of managerial economics and decision sciences at the KelloggSchool,thereisincreasingawarenessthatitalsomakesgoodbusinesssensetodesignone'soperations around social and environmental sustainability. With the rising cost of raw materials, shifts in stakeholder expectations, increasing complexity of global supply, chains, and new government standards (including the U.S.'s Clean Power Plan and the U.N.'s commitments to fight climate change), reducing one's impact on the environment is more than just a public service—it is becoming part of the valueproposition."Everyone recognizes that this is the direction we need to go," Islegen says. "Now it's a matter of making environmentalperformanceapartofcorporatestrategy.Andwefindthatthereactuallyarestrategicreasonsto build sustainable operations. It might even give you anedge."Becoming an Industry PioneerThere has always been at least one incentive for companies to focus on environmental performance: avoiding negative publicity. And with the explosion of social media, that incentive has only strengthened. Any news of severe pollution or lax environmental standards will spread instantaneously — and leave a mark. Volkswagen found this out after designing engines to cheat on emissions tests in 11 million of its diesel cars. The company is now reeling from customer anger, product recalls, and plummeting shares, not to mention fines worth billions of dollars.At the same time, business leaders are learning that clean operations and higher growth can, go hand in hand. Now that customers, investors, activists, and even a company's own employees are voicing concerns about environmental impact, a greener record does more than simply guard against public-relations disasters. It can bolster a firm's reputation.Even in cases where a sustainable operations strategy drives up costs, the advantages that come with a good reputation Can go a long way towards offsetting those costs. Becoming an industry pioneer, for example, can strengthen a firm's appeal among potential customers and partners, and grant that firm a prominent voice in globalcivilsociety—allofwhichultimatelyservesthebusiness.TheoutdoorapparelcompanyPatagoniaisone such industry leader. In 2010, Patagonia helped found the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, an alliance of 30 companies from the clothing and footwearindustries."Companies that improve their environmental performance need not surrender competitive advantage," Islegen says.Question :1.How can becoming "green" be an advantage to a company? Justify yourside.2.Do you believe that reducing one's impact on the environment is more than just a public service and is becoming part of the value proposition? Explain this statement and give examples of 3 companies that are into thispractice?3.Research about Patagonia and relate how it reach to be an industryleader.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Example of failure of business. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Your Moral Compass</p><p>For the most part, a new employee walks into a business as a fully-formed human being, meaning they already have a core set of values. Our values are our central beliefs; they're what motivate us, and they also shape our actions. Things like honesty, integrity and fairness might be part of that value set.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes you hear the word values used in conjunction with ethics - how do they differ? Ethics is a branch of philosophy that seeks to distinguish right from wrong, moral from immoral, by using logic and reason. So, in a business sense, an organization can have core values that it operates within and a set of business ethics it can use to distinguish between right and wrong behavior.</p><p></p><p>What about another similar word - morals? Morals are a system of beliefs, often backed up by a religious or political philosophy. A business can use its set of ethics alongside its morals to guide the organization's behavior.</p><p></p><p>The greatest possible synergy comes when an individual works for an organization that has a set of values that matches their own. In an ideal world, it would also be great if an organization's stated values (what the organization tells the world and its employees) actually matched its operating values (what the organization really does).</p><p></p><p>Values and Behavior in the Workplace</p><p>Many companies have a written mission statement that they share with employees and customers. A mission statement describes basic things about the business, like markets served, reason for being and business goals. It can also contain a short version of the principles and values that guide the organization. An effective mission statement can be internalized by employees to provide a framework for their decisions.</p><p></p><p>Companies can use things like written codes of conduct and employee training to reinforce the types of behavior they want from the employees. They can also implement systems of rewards and punishments to help guide employees to do the right thing. Company leaders can also model behavior they want from employees - actions speak louder than words.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>Answer not mine</p><br />

There are several reasons why so many people attend theOlympic games or watch them on television. One reason istradition. The name Olympics and the torch and flame remindpeople of the ancient games. People can escape the ordinariness ofdaily life by attending or watching the Olympics. They like toidentify with someone else’s individual sacrifice andaccomplishment. National pride is another reason, and an athlete’sor a team’s hard-earned victory becomes a nation’s victory. Thereare national medal counts and people keep track of how manymedals their country’s athletes have won.2. One problem with the modern Olympics is that it has becomevery big and expensive to operate. The city or country that hoststhe games often loses a lot of money. A stadium, pools, andplaying fields must be built for the athletic events and housing isneeded for the athletes who come from around the world. And allof these facilities are used for only two weeks! In 1984 LosAngeles solved these problems by charging a fee for companieswho wanted to be official sponsors of the games. Companies likeMcDonald’s paid a lot of money to be part of the Olympics. Manybuildings that were already built in Los Angeles area were alsoused. The coliseum where the 1932 games were held was usedagain and many colleges and universities in the area becameplaying and living areas.3. A phobia is an intense fear or feeling of anxiety that occurs onlyin a particular situation that frightens you.

At other times you don’t feel anxious.For example, if you have a phobia of spiders (as millions of peopledo), you only feel anxious when there’s a spider around, otherwiseyou feel fine. About one in ten people has a significant phobia,although few people seek treatment.4. “Mom, I believe that it is very necessary for me to have my owntablet,” Keisha said persuasively. And Mom answered with ateasing smile on her face, “Honey, but your current situation showsthe contrary.​</h2><br />

                            15. Read each passage below and determine which patterns of idea development each represents. Circle any signal words that could be used to help identify the text type and underline any other words or phrases that helped you make your decision Passages	Pattern1. There are several reasons why so many people attend the Olympic games or watch them on television. One reason is tradition. The name Olympics and the torch and flame remind people of the ancient games. People can escape the ordinariness of daily life by attending or watching the Olympics. They like to identify with someone else’s individual sacrifice and accomplishment. National pride is another reason, and an athlete’s or a team’s hard-earned victory becomes a nation’s victory. There are national medal counts and people keep track of how many medals their country’s athletes have won. 	2. One problem with the modern Olympics is that it has become very big and expensive to operate. The city or country that hosts the games often loses a lot of money. A stadium, pools, and playing fields must be built for the athletic events and housing is needed for the athletes who come from around the world. And all of these facilities are used for only two weeks! In 1984 Los Angeles solved these problems by charging a fee for companies who wanted to be official sponsors of the games. Companies like McDonald’s paid a lot of money to be part of the Olympics. Many buildings that were already built in Los Angeles area were also used. The coliseum where the 1932 games were held was used again and many colleges and universities in the area became playing and living areas. 	3. A phobia is an intense fear or feeling of anxiety that occurs only in a particular situation that frightens you. This might be something as seemingly logical as a fear of heights, or as illogical as a fear of the color green. At other times you don’t feel anxious. For example, if you have a phobia of spiders (as millions of people do), you only feel anxious when there’s a spider around, otherwise you feel fine. About one in ten people has a significant phobia, although few people seek treatment. 	4. “Mom, I believe that it is very necessary for me to have my own tablet,” Keisha said persuasively. And Mom answered with a teasing smile on her face, “Honey, but your current situation shows the contrary.” 	​</h2><br />

                            24. Going Green Can Be Good for the Bottom LineBy Yevgenia NaybergSource: https://insighf.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/going-green-can-be-good-for-the-bottom-lineThese days, almost every company supports the idea of a greener planet. Most acknowledge the ethical case for building supply chains that conserve energy and cause less environmental damage.At the December 2015 Paris Climate Conference, nearly every nation in the world announced their plans to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions. In the coming years new national climate policies will inevitably shift how businessesoperate.Thesoonercompaniesaligntheiroperationswiththistrend,thebettertheywilldoatturning the challenge of growing while reducing emissions into a competitiveadvantage.But according to Ozge Islegen, an assistant professor of managerial economics and decision sciences at the KelloggSchool,thereisincreasingawarenessthatitalsomakesgoodbusinesssensetodesignone'soperations around social and environmental sustainability. With the rising cost of raw materials, shifts in stakeholder expectations, increasing complexity of global supply, chains, and new government standards (including the U.S.'s Clean Power Plan and the U.N.'s commitments to fight climate change), reducing one's impact on the environment is more than just a public service—it is becoming part of the valueproposition."Everyone recognizes that this is the direction we need to go," Islegen says. "Now it's a matter of making environmentalperformanceapartofcorporatestrategy.Andwefindthatthereactuallyarestrategicreasonsto build sustainable operations. It might even give you anedge."Becoming an Industry PioneerThere has always been at least one incentive for companies to focus on environmental performance: avoiding negative publicity. And with the explosion of social media, that incentive has only strengthened. Any news of severe pollution or lax environmental standards will spread instantaneously — and leave a mark. Volkswagen found this out after designing engines to cheat on emissions tests in 11 million of its diesel cars. The company is now reeling from customer anger, product recalls, and plummeting shares, not to mention fines worth billions of dollars.At the same time, business leaders are learning that clean operations and higher growth can, go hand in hand. Now that customers, investors, activists, and even a company's own employees are voicing concerns about environmental impact, a greener record does more than simply guard against public-relations disasters. It can bolster a firm's reputation.Even in cases where a sustainable operations strategy drives up costs, the advantages that come with a good reputation Can go a long way towards offsetting those costs. Becoming an industry pioneer, for example, can strengthen a firm's appeal among potential customers and partners, and grant that firm a prominent voice in globalcivilsociety—allofwhichultimatelyservesthebusiness.TheoutdoorapparelcompanyPatagoniaisone such industry leader. In 2010, Patagonia helped found the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, an alliance of 30 companies from the clothing and footwearindustries."Companies that improve their environmental performance need not surrender competitive advantage," Islegen says.Question :1.How can becoming "green" be an advantage to a company? Justify yourside.2.Do you believe that reducing one's impact on the environment is more than just a public service and is becoming part of the value proposition? Explain this statement and give examples of 3 companies that are into thispractice?3.Research about Patagonia and relate how it reach to be an industryleader.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1.The amount of energy the company uses is reduced when they go green which means that waste is reduced and companies get an improved supply chain management system. It also allows businvess to adopt new technologies to increase productivity. With cost reduced, it would allow the business to grow and remain sustainable.<p>2.Yes</p><strong>A good value proposition can give you an advantage over your competitors and is often what your prospects use to evaluate you. And for many consumers, your value proposition is the first thing they encounter when exploring your brand. So, having a clear, concise value proposition is more important than ever.
