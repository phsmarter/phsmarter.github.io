                                            How to revise essay POVERTYWe can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like Food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, et A poor person is not able to get an education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems. Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing, and shelter. However, poverty is more, much more than just not having enough money. The World Bank Organization describes poverty in this way: poverty is hunger. Poverty is a lack of shelter. Poverty is sick and not and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not having access to school and not knowing how to read. Poverty is not having a job, fear of the future, and living one day at a time. Despite many definitions, one thing is certain; poverty is a complex societal issue. No matter how poverty is defined, it can be agreed that it is an issue that requires everybody’s attention. Many people believe that poor people are poor because they have chosen to be poor. Most rich people said that all poor people should look for a job that would help them live better, and help them to maintain their family in a warm place, and alive. Rich people said this because they have realized that every person that is rich has to work very hard they also realize that if poor people start working hard like they do they would not have to be in poor situations by the poor working hard they would be able to get out of poverty. Like it tells us about a better life, “poor people could look for jobs that will allow them to have a much better life with more money than the one they have,” In this evidence, we are able to see that poor people are being offended by the believes that rich people have because they think that the life of poor people is just as easy as the life they have. This is telling us that most rich people think that being poor is easy and that because they have worked hard on everything they have, they should not be responsible for helping them. Many of these rich people also think that they are not forced to help those people in need, because rich people work hard on their money and on everything they have, and they believe that they don’t have to waste their money on other people that don’t have any money. In conclusion, poverty is not the problem of a person but the whole nation. Also, it should be dealt with on an urgent basis through the implementation of effective measures. In addition, the eradication of poverty has become necessary for the sustainable and inclusive growth of people, society, country, and economy.​</a>

                                            Read the following persuasive essay carefully. Encircle the verbs, box the adjectives, and underline the adverbs that express strong or pressing points. Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</a>

                            13. How to revise essay POVERTYWe can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like Food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, et A poor person is not able to get an education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems. Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing, and shelter. However, poverty is more, much more than just not having enough money. The World Bank Organization describes poverty in this way: poverty is hunger. Poverty is a lack of shelter. Poverty is sick and not and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not having access to school and not knowing how to read. Poverty is not having a job, fear of the future, and living one day at a time. Despite many definitions, one thing is certain; poverty is a complex societal issue. No matter how poverty is defined, it can be agreed that it is an issue that requires everybody’s attention. Many people believe that poor people are poor because they have chosen to be poor. Most rich people said that all poor people should look for a job that would help them live better, and help them to maintain their family in a warm place, and alive. Rich people said this because they have realized that every person that is rich has to work very hard they also realize that if poor people start working hard like they do they would not have to be in poor situations by the poor working hard they would be able to get out of poverty. Like it tells us about a better life, “poor people could look for jobs that will allow them to have a much better life with more money than the one they have,” In this evidence, we are able to see that poor people are being offended by the believes that rich people have because they think that the life of poor people is just as easy as the life they have. This is telling us that most rich people think that being poor is easy and that because they have worked hard on everything they have, they should not be responsible for helping them. Many of these rich people also think that they are not forced to help those people in need, because rich people work hard on their money and on everything they have, and they believe that they don’t have to waste their money on other people that don’t have any money. In conclusion, poverty is not the problem of a person but the whole nation. Also, it should be dealt with on an urgent basis through the implementation of effective measures. In addition, the eradication of poverty has become necessary for the sustainable and inclusive growth of people, society, country, and economy.​</h2><br />

They believe that poor people should just work harder to improve their lives. However, this is not always the case.

It is not fair to judge people in poverty without understanding the structural and systemic issues that contribute to their plight.</p><p></p><p>To eradicate poverty, effective measures must be implemented by the government and society at large. These measures should focus on providing access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities to the poor.

                            22. Read the following persuasive essay carefully. Encircle the verbs, box the adjectives, and underline the adverbs that express strong or pressing points. Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</h2><br />
