                                            Dut God's Wisdom (Devotional)"To those who sold doves he said, 'Get these things out of here!! How dare you turn my Father'shouse into a market!” (John 2:16)and in such sense as neither men nor angels are; and which carries in it a reason why he was soJesus calls the temple, which was built as an house for God, and where the symbols of his presence;where his worship was kept, and sacrifices offered to him and he asserts God, whose house thiswas, to be his Father, and himself to be his son, as none of the prophets that went before him did;much concerned for the honourof God, and so much resented the profanation of his house, becausehe was his Father. A like action with thisdone by Christ at another time was recorded in (Matthew21:12, Matthew 21:13). This was at the beginning of his ministry, that at the close of it, in whichhe expressed himself with more warmth and severity than here: here he only charges them withmaking his Father's house an house of merchandise.What can we learn from Jesus anger?There are times when it's right to be angry.This is a very important thing for us to understand- Jesus got angry; but He did not sin. If He sinnedin doing this, we would have no hope. The so called "Religious leaders” had turned the Temple,(where the presence of God was); into a shopping mall. There are times that we need to be angry.The challenge is not sinning when you get angry.Just because something is accepted by society does not mean it is acceptable to God.This was how it was- The people were cheating people to worship and serve God. People werepaying these outrageous prices in order to worship God. That's just how it was; and they had todeal with it. Sound familiar? We hear this sort of thing every single day.It's more important to be spiritually correct than to be politically correct.Is your goal to please people or to please God?16 it bePrayer1985​</a>
