Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</a>

For me family is really important. You can lean on someone, find a support and help. It’s much easier to solve the problems when you have a family. I always imagine me standind with my husband and children in our house. My future husband will be strong and kind, he will love me. One day we would buy a house. I don’t want to have a big house, it should be little, quite and cozy. Maybe we will have children. I want to have a little daughter so that I can play with her. I would teach her to read, to write, to swim, to dance. I know that children is a big responsibility.It’s hard to make them good people. I will spend a lot of time talking with them about everything they want to know. I will explain them what good is and how to behave. Every weekend we will go to the country and make a picnic, because my parents always took me with them and I enjoyed the meadows and flowers. This will be our tradition.</p><p>We will celebrate everything together. New year, Christmas and so on – I think that celebrating it with your family is the best thing ever.</p><p></p><br />

                            4. 300 word essay "How does my family help me with my dreams"​</h2><br />
                        <p>When achieving our goals, having a supportive family is a huge asset. They can offer emotional support and advice on how to deal with the difficulties you may face. They can also provide financial assistance and serve as motivation to continue moving forward. Having the support of your family can also make the process more enjoyable and give you the confidence to take risks. Having a family who believes in you and is willing to assist you can make all the difference in achieving your objectives. Our families can provide us with the support, advice, and resources to succeed. My family has been an invaluable source of support for my personal goals. Whenever things seem overwhelming, they encouraged me and provided the resources I needed to stay on track. I was always fascinated by the stars in the night sky as a child. I'd lie in my bed and gaze at the blanket of stars, daydreaming about distant lands. My parents encouraged my goals and supported me in whatever I chose. I'd tell them about the places I wanted to visit, the activities I wanted to do, and the people I wanted to meet. I would do this because I knew they would never let me down. My goals shifted over time, but my family was always there to support me. They helped me develop into the person I am today. They never gave up on me, and for that, I am grateful. My family is my greatest cheerleader and supporter. They have provided me with the inspiration and encouragement I require to keep moving forward. And I know they will always be there for me. I will be eternally grateful to my family, and I know they are the reason I can achieve my goals. They are always there for me, no matter what my dreams are. I will be eternally grateful for their love and support, and I am confident that they will continue to help me achieve my goals.</p><br />

Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This long essay is suitable for students from classes 6,7,8, 9, and 10, respectively, for school assignment/event purpose. This essay will also assist and guide success to those aspiring students applying for competitive examinations.</p><p></p><p>Dreams are essential. From the childhood stage, kids are made to aspiring something big. They are fed with the importance of a successful career. Every individual they pass by, questions their aim, thus career becomes the central focus. While a career is a part of a professional establishment, it is equally important to nurture health, relationships, and mainly dreams.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Determination is the first step you need to take to convert your dreams into reality. It will aid you in many ways. Determination will help you set the course of action and help you plan the journey for something. Besides, it will help you steady your pace towards the dream.</p><p></p><p>However big my dream is, having short term goals will always rescue. This is highly important as making hasty decisions will not help you get closer to your dream. Some dreams require time to nurture, some require procedures to follow, without which you cannot achieve your dream.</p><p></p><p>You may dream big in life, but to achieve them, you must set long and short term goals. These goals will make you steady, taking a step at a time, without hastily jumping into all at once. For instance, I aspire to become a writer, and to make this possible, I need to graduate from a reputed institution.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>To keep yourself check on your route towards dreams, you need motivation. Lack of motivation is the sole reason for a person to give up on his dreams. So, staying positive and motivated is a part of achieving your dreams/goals. There are many individuals out there who have lost dreams mid-way due to a lack of motivation.</p><p></p><p>To achieve your dream, you have to place the goal in your mind. You need to remind yourself every day about your dream. You will experience challenging times where you will feel the urge to quit, but remember your ultimate dream/goal. If you feel messed up, start over with a fresh and positive attitude.</p><p></p><p>Another boost towards your dream is a reward. You necessarily don’t have to cover milestones to get rewarded, instead set short-terms goals and achieve. This reward can be as simple as meeting up with old friends or cleaning your room. Besides, these short-term goals are your lifesavers to stay motivated.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>While working towards your goal without any breaks can hamper your productivity. Besides, too much continuous effort can lead to de-motivation. So, taking a break would help you relax before you indulge in your goals. Take a break between your schedule and engage yourself in hobbies or activities.</p><p></p><p>Your surrounding company holds an impact on you and your work towards the dream. So, surround yourself with people who encourage and appreciate you. It is best to stay away from people who criticize and distract you.</p><p></p><p>To wrap it up, dreaming of a goal is easier than achieving it. To fulfill your dreams, you need to sacrifice multiple things. Above all, the pathways towards your dream will help you achieve it.
