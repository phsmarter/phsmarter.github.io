The Telephone by Edward Field
My Happiness depends on an electric appliance
And I do not mind giving it so much credit
With life in this city being what it is
Each person separated from friends
By a tangle of subways and buses
Yes my telephone is my joy
It tells me that I am in the word and wanted
It rings and I am alerted to love or gossip
I go comb my hair which begins to sparkle
Without it I was like a bear in a cave
Drowsing through a shadowy winter
It rings and spring has come
I stretch and amble out into the sunshine
Hungry again as I pick up the receiver
For the human voice and the good news of friends
Please help me. Thank you</a>

                                            What Are the Differences Between City Life and Farm Life?
Farm life provides a natural environment surrounded by trees, animals, and
the natural life cycle. The environment where cities live is based on concrete,
buildings, and very small observable properties. In the agricultural lifestyle, people
work in the land every day, cultivate food and breed animals. City lifestyle provides
work to office buildings and retail shopping districts.
Families living in the agricultural lifestyle are often together, and each
member contributes to the management of the farm. City life is more busy, it is
more common for families to leave each other pursuing their own personal
purpose. In the city, special families are established to take care of the elderly of
the family.
From the perspective of individual needs, farmers pay more attention to the
necessity of things and the necessity of lack of things. Farmers need to prioritize
demand, but advertising and commercialism are not so attractive. Urban life makes
more materialism possible, and urban people tend to equate their needs. Urban life
is often competitive and people are further promoted by material needs.
Another contrast between city life and farm life is the surrounding
environment. Farm life is often referred to as a more peaceful and healthy lifestyle.
For example, farm life provides residents with the opportunity to have a good time
in nature, without going to places like parks. Individuals are surrounded by
natural gifts such as trees, sunlight, wind, animals, circulation of nature. In
contras, people who are living in the city live in daily stress related to urban life
such as getting involved in traffic congestion, coping with high crime rates, and in
most cases paying a higher tax rate. There is no need to suffer. It is well known
that lack of such stress factors can have a major impact on overall quality of life.
Alternatively, urban life is often portrayed as being fast-paced, modern, polluted,
full of work stress and economic pressure (re-comparison 1).
When comparing the life on the farm and the life in the city, there are many
differences and similarities between the two. Each of these places has a special and
unique one. The choice of the place of residence is very personal and it depends on
personal values. I personally prefer farm life, but other people may choose to live in
the city because they are enjoying more busy and social lifestyles. Factors to
consider before choosing two are the environment, lifestyle, and family values.

The Telephone by Edward Field
My Happiness depends on an electric appliance
And I do not mind giving it so much credit
With life in this city being what it is
Each person separated from friends
By a tangle of subways and buses
Yes my telephone is my joy
It tells me that I am in the word and wanted
It rings and I am alerted to love or gossip
I go comb my hair which begins to sparkle
Without it I was like a bear in a cave
Drowsing through a shadowy winter
It rings and spring has come
I stretch and amble out into the sunshine
Hungry again as I pick up the receiver
For the human voice and the good news of friends
Please help me. Thank you</a>

Aquino I am Rina a Grade VI pupil living in the City. I am a transferee in our school since mother decided to return back to the city where she works. One day, upon going home from the school I feel worried for I knew no one and besides I don't understand their dialect and I see lot of drunkards along the sidewalks. I walk almost a kilometer before I reach our house. As I enter the gate, I still see the children sniffing the so called “rugby".

The Telephone by Edward Field
My Happiness depends on an electric appliance
And I do not mind giving it so much credit
With life in this city being what it is
Each person separated from friends
By a tangle of subways and buses
Yes my telephone is my joy
It tells me that I am in the word and wanted
It rings and I am alerted to love or gossip
I go comb my hair which begins to sparkle
Without it I was like a bear in a cave
Drowsing through a shadowy winter
It rings and spring has come
I stretch and amble out into the sunshine
Hungry again as I pick up the receiver
For the human voice and the good news of friends
Please help me. Thank you</h2><br />

                            13. What Are the Differences Between City Life and Farm Life?
Farm life provides a natural environment surrounded by trees, animals, and
the natural life cycle. The environment where cities live is based on concrete,
buildings, and very small observable properties. In the agricultural lifestyle, people
work in the land every day, cultivate food and breed animals. City lifestyle provides
work to office buildings and retail shopping districts.
Families living in the agricultural lifestyle are often together, and each
member contributes to the management of the farm. City life is more busy, it is
more common for families to leave each other pursuing their own personal
purpose. In the city, special families are established to take care of the elderly of
the family.
From the perspective of individual needs, farmers pay more attention to the
necessity of things and the necessity of lack of things. Farmers need to prioritize
demand, but advertising and commercialism are not so attractive. Urban life makes
more materialism possible, and urban people tend to equate their needs. Urban life
is often competitive and people are further promoted by material needs.
Another contrast between city life and farm life is the surrounding
environment. Farm life is often referred to as a more peaceful and healthy lifestyle.
For example, farm life provides residents with the opportunity to have a good time
in nature, without going to places like parks. Individuals are surrounded by
natural gifts such as trees, sunlight, wind, animals, circulation of nature. In
contras, people who are living in the city live in daily stress related to urban life
such as getting involved in traffic congestion, coping with high crime rates, and in
most cases paying a higher tax rate. There is no need to suffer. It is well known
that lack of such stress factors can have a major impact on overall quality of life.
Alternatively, urban life is often portrayed as being fast-paced, modern, polluted,
full of work stress and economic pressure (re-comparison 1).
When comparing the life on the farm and the life in the city, there are many
differences and similarities between the two. Each of these places has a special and
unique one. The choice of the place of residence is very personal and it depends on
personal values. I personally prefer farm life, but other people may choose to live in
the city because they are enjoying more busy and social lifestyles. Factors to
consider before choosing two are the environment, lifestyle, and family values.

The Telephone by Edward Field
My Happiness depends on an electric appliance
And I do not mind giving it so much credit
With life in this city being what it is
Each person separated from friends
By a tangle of subways and buses
Yes my telephone is my joy
It tells me that I am in the word and wanted
It rings and I am alerted to love or gossip
I go comb my hair which begins to sparkle
Without it I was like a bear in a cave
Drowsing through a shadowy winter
It rings and spring has come
I stretch and amble out into the sunshine
Hungry again as I pick up the receiver
For the human voice and the good news of friends
Please help me. Thank you</h2><br />

                            21. Directions: Read the story and make connections using text-to-self as you fill in the chart below.  The Telephone by Edward Field My happiness depends on an electric appliance And I do not mind giving it so much credit With life in this city being what it is Each person separated from friends By a tangle of subways and buses Yes my telephone is my joy It tells me that I am in the world and wanted It rings and I am alerted to love or gossip 	I go comb my hair which begins to sparkle Without it, I was like a bear in a cave Drowsing through a shadowy winter It rings and spring has come 	 I stretch and amble out into the sunshine Hungry again as I pick up the receiver For the human voice and the good news of friends. “Telephone" by Edward Field, from Counting Myself Lucky. © Black Sparrow Press, 1992. In the story 	In my life Discuss what is happening in the story 	What does it remind me of my life? 	How is it similar to my life? 	How is it different from my life? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The poem entitled Telephone is related to a real-life situation. When we have telephone, we can easily talk to someone or communicate to them, but the big difference is, we cannot know what their feelings and that's something similar to our lives.</p><br />
