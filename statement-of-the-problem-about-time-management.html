                                            School Management in a PandemicExcerpt from the article written by a Teacher 3 at Magapit National High School in Cagayan.In times of crisis, leaders are the ones we depend upon to calm our nerves and plan a clear path ahead even if taking that path requires great toil and sacrifice. Faced with almost unbearable pressure and stress, school principals are at the forefront of “pandemic learning.” The Covid-19 pandemic prompted educational leaders around the globe to make tough choices. How can they best look after the welfare of their staff and students and come out strong and learned?Leaders must act swiftly and with foresight but also with careful consideration of options, consequences and side effects of actions taken. They must communicate with clarity and purpose but also with empathy and humanity. The pandemic has exacerbated the learning crisis for low-income and middle-income countries in Asia and the Pacific, and this will likely translate into loss in lifetime opportunities and earnings. The flexibility and innovation needed to support a school’s critical academic, social-emotional and custodial functions requires school leaders to acquire and apply new knowledge, skills and capacities in their planning and decision making. An educator once said, “We must plan for the unplanned. We must be able to pivot based on evolving circumstances by altering duties, expectations, procedures, calendars, schedules, curricula and operational practices.”Improved communication, professional development and technology integration will be necessary to shift schools to be more fluid and responsive. With this flexibility, we can fix problems and initiate improvements as they arise.1.

                            3. help po pls pa enumerate po itosalamat nalang poSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMThis study sought to find out the challenges of modular distance learning students in SLSP. Thus, this mainly focuses on the problems that they face while answering the given modules. Generally, this research seeks to answer the following questions:1. What are the challenges that modular learning students encounter?2. What are the thoughts and feelings of students about the new distance learning?3. How does the student manage his/her time?4. How does the school help the students in the new learning modality?</h2><br />
                        <p>1. One of the main problem that students are struggling with in the modular learning is the slow internet connection, there are times when students are taking a quiz online, then suddenly the forms refreshed and you'll  lose your answers and progress, you have no choice but to repeat the quiz.</p><p>2. The distance learning tells us students that education is a priviledge, not a right. There are instances that we are required to pass the activities on time even though our internet connection is slow, their solution is we either pass it early or buy a load, what about the working students or the students who belong to the poorest family? </p><p></p><br />

                            29. School Management in a PandemicExcerpt from the article written by a Teacher 3 at Magapit National High School in Cagayan.In times of crisis, leaders are the ones we depend upon to calm our nerves and plan a clear path ahead even if taking that path requires great toil and sacrifice. Faced with almost unbearable pressure and stress, school principals are at the forefront of “pandemic learning.” The Covid-19 pandemic prompted educational leaders around the globe to make tough choices. How can they best look after the welfare of their staff and students and come out strong and learned?Leaders must act swiftly and with foresight but also with careful consideration of options, consequences and side effects of actions taken. They must communicate with clarity and purpose but also with empathy and humanity. The pandemic has exacerbated the learning crisis for low-income and middle-income countries in Asia and the Pacific, and this will likely translate into loss in lifetime opportunities and earnings. The flexibility and innovation needed to support a school’s critical academic, social-emotional and custodial functions requires school leaders to acquire and apply new knowledge, skills and capacities in their planning and decision making. An educator once said, “We must plan for the unplanned. We must be able to pivot based on evolving circumstances by altering duties, expectations, procedures, calendars, schedules, curricula and operational practices.”Improved communication, professional development and technology integration will be necessary to shift schools to be more fluid and responsive. With this flexibility, we can fix problems and initiate improvements as they arise.1.
