                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> Important e Ang Communication upang Tayo ay magkausap I text gaya Ng Online school ngayon</p>Communication comes from the Latin word "communicare" means (to share). My insights about this lesson is the effective communication begins with understanding and it refers  to the transmission and passage of information. We can communicate by the use of verbal and non-verbal communication.  The verbal communication is the spoken and written conveyance of message and on the other hand the non-verbal communication is the transmission of messages or signals through a nonverbal platform such as eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, posture, and the distance between two individuals. The communication is very important because it has a symbolic nature and is an act of sharing one's ideas, emotions, attitudes, or perceptions with another person or group of persons through words (written or spoken), gestures and transmitting image. Communication involves at least two persons, a sender and a receiver. The sender is called communicator and the receiver of the message is known as communicate.<br />

                            5. make a reflection, of what you have learn about purposive communication (essay)​500 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Purposive communication is a type of communication that is intentional and goal-oriented. It involves the use of language and other forms of communication to achieve a specific objective or purpose. In my studies of purposive communication, I have learned about the importance of effective communication in achieving personal and professional goals.</p><p></p><p>One of the key things I have learned about purposive communication is that it requires careful planning and preparation. Before engaging in purposive communication, it is important to identify the objectives and goals that you want to achieve. This involves understanding the audience that you are communicating with, their needs, and their expectations. By doing so, you can tailor your message to meet their specific needs and ensure that your communication is effective.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of purposive communication is the use of clear and concise language. Effective communication requires that you use language that is easy to understand and that conveys your message clearly. This means avoiding jargon or technical terms that may not be familiar to your audience. By using simple and straightforward language, you can ensure that your message is understood and that your communication is effective.</p><p></p><p>I have also learned that purposive communication requires active listening. This means paying attention to the needs and concerns of your audience and responding appropriately. Effective communication requires that you listen to feedback and adjust your message accordingly. By doing so, you can ensure that your communication is relevant and meets the needs of your audience.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these key principles, I have also learned about the importance of nonverbal communication in purposive communication. Nonverbal communication includes things like body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice. These nonverbal cues can convey important information about your message and can help to reinforce your message. By paying attention to your nonverbal communication, you can ensure that your message is received and understood by your audience.</p><p></p><p>Overall, my studies of purposive communication have taught me that effective communication is essential for achieving personal and professional goals. By carefully planning and preparing your message, using clear and concise language, actively listening to your audience, and paying attention to your nonverbal communication, you can ensure that your communication is effective and achieves its intended purpose. Whether you are communicating with colleagues, clients, or friends and family, these principles of purposive communication can help you to communicate more effectively and achieve your goals.</p><br />

                            6. write a 700 words essay about Why does oral presentation related to communication for work purposes?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Oral presentations are a critical component of effective workplace communication, as they allow individuals to share information, ideas, and opinions in a clear and concise manner. Whether it is delivering a sales pitch, presenting a project proposal, or leading a team meeting, oral presentations are an essential tool for successful communication in the workplace.</p><p></p><p>One of the primary reasons why oral presentations are so important for work purposes is that they help individuals to convey their message clearly and effectively. Unlike written communication, which can be misinterpreted or misunderstood, oral presentations allow individuals to use their voice, tone, and body language to convey their message in a more impactful way. This is particularly important in situations where there is a lot of information to convey or where the topic may be complex or technical.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why oral presentations are critical for workplace communication is that they allow individuals to engage with their audience in a more personal and interactive way. Whether it is a one-on-one presentation or a large group presentation, oral presentations provide individuals with the opportunity to build relationships and connect with their audience on a deeper level. This can help to build trust, establish credibility, and ultimately, achieve the desired outcome of the presentation.</p><p></p><p>In addition to building relationships, oral presentations also help to inspire and motivate individuals in the workplace. Whether it is a motivational speech, a team-building exercise, or a training session, oral presentations provide individuals with the opportunity to inspire and motivate their audience to achieve their goals. This is particularly important in a work environment where individuals may be facing challenges or obstacles, as it can help to boost morale and create a more positive and productive work environment.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, oral presentations are a critical tool for effective leadership in the workplace. Whether it is leading a team meeting or presenting a strategic plan, oral presentations provide leaders with the opportunity to communicate their vision, goals, and expectations in a clear and concise manner. This can help to inspire and motivate their team, build trust and credibility, and ultimately, achieve success in their respective roles.</p><p></p><p>Finally, oral presentations are important for workplace communication because they help individuals to develop and refine their communication skills. Oral presentations require individuals to be confident, articulate, and organized, which are all essential skills for effective communication in the workplace. By regularly presenting in front of an audience, individuals can develop these skills and become more effective communicators, which can ultimately help them to advance in their careers.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, oral presentations are a critical component of effective workplace communication. They allow individuals to convey their message clearly and effectively, engage with their audience in a more personal and interactive way, inspire and motivate individuals in the workplace, provide leaders with the opportunity to communicate their vision and goals, and help individuals to develop and refine their communication skills. Whether it is delivering a sales pitch, presenting a project proposal, or leading a team meeting, oral presentations are an essential tool for successful communication in the workplace. Therefore, it is important for individuals to invest time and effort in developing their oral presentation skills, as it can ultimately help them to achieve success in their respective roles and advance in their careers.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana Po Maka tulong </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Community Pantries in Philippines</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Community Pantries in the Philippines</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Filipinos are demonstrating their "bayanihan" spirit by establishing community pantries. The community pantry is a grassroots initiative that provides food and other essential items to those in need. It began with a small group of volunteers in Quezon City, but it quickly spread throughout the country, with thousands of community pantries popping up in various cities and municipalities.</p><p></p><p>The community pantry movement has gained momentum due to the government's slow response to the pandemic. Filipinos who have lost their jobs or livelihoods due to lockdowns and quarantines have been struggling to put food on the table. The community pantries provide them with much-needed assistance. The pantries rely on donations from individuals, groups, and even businesses, and the items are available to anyone who needs them. The community pantry movement has become a symbol of hope and solidarity during these challenging times.</p><p></p><p>Despite its success, the community pantry movement has faced challenges, including red-tagging, where organizers and volunteers are accused of being communist sympathizers. The government has also expressed concerns about the unregulated distribution of goods and the potential for crowds to gather, which could spread the virus. Despite these challenges, the community pantry movement continues to thrive and provide aid to those in need.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the community pantry movement is a remarkable display of the Filipino spirit of bayanihan. It highlights the importance of community solidarity and demonstrates the power of people coming together to help those in need. Despite facing challenges, the community pantries have become a beacon of hope and a symbol of resilience in these difficult times.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>.yan po pa brainliest </p><p></p><br />

                            15. make a reflection, of what you have learn on midterm discussion about purposive communication (essay)​500 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Throughout the midterm discussion on purposive communication, I have gained a deeper understanding of how communication should be used to fulfill a specific purpose. From learning about the different components of effective communication to the various contexts in which it is used, I have come to appreciate the significance of communication in our daily lives.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, I have learned that effective communication involves several key elements such as sender, receiver, message, and feedback. These aspects work together to ensure that the intended message is conveyed accurately and received as intended. Additionally, I have come to understand the importance of tailoring the message to suit the audience, considering their age, cultural background, and social status, among other factors.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I have learned about the various contexts in which communication is used, such as in interpersonal communication, public speaking, and group communication. In each context, there are unique communication skills required to achieve the desired purpose. For instance, in public speaking, one needs to be skilled in articulating their thoughts and capturing the attention of the audience. The importance of nonverbal cues, such as body language and tone, has also been emphasized, as they can convey additional meaning to the intended message.</p><p></p><p>Another critical aspect of communication that I have learned is the significance of purpose in communication. In purposive communication, the aim is to achieve specific goals or objectives, such as persuading, informing, or entertaining. This means that communication should be planned and executed in a way that best suits the intended purpose. For instance, when seeking to persuade, it is essential to use persuasive language, emotional appeals, and logical arguments to achieve the desired outcome.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the role of technology in communication has been highlighted. In today's digital age, communication has significantly evolved with the use of various social media platforms, instant messaging apps, and email communication. However, despite the convenience and ease of using technology to communicate, it should be used cautiously, considering the diverse audiences and contexts in which communication takes place. Hence, it is crucial to use discretion, civility, and professionalism when communicating through technology.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Thats your 500 words essay</p><p></p><br />

The Community Action Plan</p><p></p><p>A. Problem</p><p></p><p>Three environmental problems that are evident within the community are:</p><p></p><p>Lack of earthquake-resistant buildings - Many buildings in the community are not built to withstand earthquakes, which can lead to collapse and severe damage.</p><p></p><p>Inadequate emergency response system - The community lacks a well-coordinated emergency response system to respond promptly and efficiently during an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>Lack of awareness and preparedness - The majority of the community lacks awareness and preparedness when it comes to earthquakes, which can lead to panic and confusion during an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>B. Suggested Policy/Program/Project</p><p></p><p>Lack of earthquake-resistant buildings:</p><p>a. Retrofitting program - The local government can establish a retrofitting program that will require building owners to retrofit their structures to make them earthquake-resistant.

Emergency drills - The local government can organize and conduct regular emergency drills for the community, including schools, hospitals, and other public institutions. These drills can help improve coordination and response times during an earthquake.</p><p>b. Establish an emergency response center - The local government can establish an emergency response center that will serve as a central point for coordinating emergency response activities. The center can be staffed by trained personnel and equipped with necessary resources, including communication equipment, medical supplies, and search and rescue tools.</p><p></p><p>Lack of awareness and preparedness:</p><p>a.

                            23. make a reflection, of what you have learn on prilem discussion about purposive communication (essay)​500 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the preliminary discussion about purposive communication, I have learned about the importance of effective communication in achieving our goals and objectives. Purposive communication is a type of communication that focuses on achieving specific outcomes or objectives. It involves planning, organizing, and delivering a message in a way that is clear, concise, and understandable to the intended audience.</p><p></p><p>One of the key takeaways from the discussion is the role of context in purposive communication. The context refers to the environment or situation in which the communication takes place. It includes the physical setting, social norms, cultural values, and other factors that can influence the meaning and interpretation of the message. To communicate effectively, it is important to consider the context and adapt the message accordingly. For example, when communicating with people from different cultures or backgrounds, it is important to be sensitive to their values and beliefs and adjust the message to avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretations.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of purposive communication is the use of language. The language we use can greatly influence how our message is perceived and understood by others. It is important to use language that is appropriate for the audience, clear, and concise. We should avoid using jargon, technical terms, or complicated language that can confuse or alienate the audience. We should also consider the tone of our message and ensure that it is respectful, courteous, and professional.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the discussion highlighted the importance of feedback in purposive communication. Feedback allows us to assess the effectiveness of our communication and make necessary adjustments. By soliciting feedback from the audience, we can identify areas for improvement and adjust our communication strategy accordingly.</p><p></p><p>In terms of qualities that make a good communicator, I have learned that it is important to be clear, concise, and confident when delivering a message. A good communicator should be able to convey their message in a way that is easily understood and engaging to the audience. They should also be able to adapt their communication style to suit the needs of the audience and the context. Good communicators are also active listeners, which means they are able to receive and interpret feedback from the audience and make necessary adjustments to their message.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the preliminary discussion on purposive communication has been very informative and insightful. It has highlighted the importance of effective communication in achieving our goals and objectives, and the key factors that contribute to successful communication. It has also emphasized the importance of adapting our communication style to suit the needs of the audience and the context. As a learner, I am now more aware of the qualities that make a good communicator, and I will strive to develop these qualities in my own communication style.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Purposive communication is a type of communication that is intentional, goal-oriented, and aimed at achieving specific objectives. It involves the use of language, symbols, and other forms of communication to convey a message that is meant to influence the thoughts, feelings, or actions of the receiver. The concept of purposive communication was discussed in detail during the midterm discussion, and I learned a lot about its importance and how it can be used effectively.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>One of the key things that I learned about purposive communication is that it is essential for achieving success in various fields, including business, politics, and social activism. In these areas, effective communication is crucial for influencing people's opinions, gaining support, and achieving goals. For example, a business leader who wants to persuade investors to invest in their company must use purposive communication to convey a message that highlights the company's strengths and potential for growth. Similarly, a politician who wants to win an election must use purposive communication to persuade voters to support their campaign.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of purposive communication that I learned about is the need to tailor the message to the audience. Different audiences have different needs, interests, and values, and effective communication requires an understanding of these differences. For example, a social activist who wants to raise awareness about a particular issue must use language and symbols that resonate with the target audience. This may involve using different communication channels, such as social media, to reach different groups of people.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I also learned that nonverbal communication plays a significant role in purposive communication. Nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions, gestures, and tone of voice, can convey important information about a person's emotions, intentions, and attitudes. Effective communicators must be aware of these nonverbal cues and use them to enhance the impact of their message.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Finally, I learned that effective communication requires practice and feedback. Like any skill, communication can be improved through practice and feedback. This may involve seeking feedback from others, such as colleagues or mentors, to identify areas for improvement. It may also involve practicing different communication techniques, such as active listening, to improve one's ability to communicate effectively.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the midterm discussion on purposive communication was a valuable learning experience that taught me a lot about the importance of effective communication in achieving specific objectives. I learned that effective communication requires an understanding of the audience, the use of nonverbal cues, and the need for practice and feedback. I believe that these lessons will be valuable not only in my personal and professional life but also in helping me to become a more effective communicator overall.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>answer with knowledge and valid opinions to help and guide the questioners‚ no copies from anyone or any website‚ pa brainliest.</p><p></p><br />

                            29. in your own opinion write a 1,000 words essay about Why does oral presentation related to communication for work purposes?​</h2><br />
                        ANSWER :<br /><br />Effective communication is the backbone of any successful organization. Whether it’s communicating with colleagues, clients, or other stakeholders, the ability to convey ideas and information clearly and effectively is essential in any work setting. Oral presentations are one of the most important communication tools in the workplace, and they serve a variety of purposes. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why oral presentations are related to communication for work purposes.<br /><br />Firstly, oral presentations are a powerful way to convey information to an audience. They allow a presenter to share ideas, data, and insights in a way that is engaging and impactful. By using visuals, stories, and other techniques, a presenter can make complex or dry information more accessible and interesting. This is especially important in the workplace, where time is often at a premium and audiences need to quickly understand and absorb information. Oral presentations can help to achieve this goal more effectively than written materials or other communication methods.<br /><br />Secondly, oral presentations are a great way to build credibility and authority. When a presenter is able to confidently and clearly articulate their ideas, they are seen as more knowledgeable and trustworthy. This is important in the workplace, where people need to trust and rely on one another to get things done. By giving a well-prepared and engaging presentation, a presenter can establish themselves as an expert in their field, and gain the respect and attention of their colleagues and superiors.<br /><br />Thirdly, oral presentations are an important way to persuade and influence others. In many workplaces, getting others to buy into your ideas and proposals is crucial for success. Oral presentations can be used to make a persuasive case for a particular course of action or to convince others of the value of a particular idea. By using persuasive language, evidence, and other tools, a presenter can sway the opinions and decisions of others in a way that is difficult to achieve through other communication methods.<br /><br />Fourthly, oral presentations can be used to foster teamwork and collaboration. By presenting ideas and information to a group, a presenter can create a shared understanding and sense of purpose. This is important in the workplace, where collaboration and teamwork are often essential for success. By presenting ideas in a clear and engaging way, a presenter can help to align the goals and objectives of different team members, and create a shared vision for the future.<br /><br />Finally, oral presentations can be used to build relationships and network with others. By presenting at conferences, seminars, or other events, a presenter can connect with colleagues and other professionals in their field. This can lead to new opportunities, collaborations, and partnerships. By sharing ideas and information with others, a presenter can build a reputation and establish themselves as a valuable contributor to their field.<br /><br />In conclusion, oral presentations are an essential tool for communication in the workplace. They serve a variety of purposes, from conveying information to persuading and influencing others, to building credibility and authority. By mastering the art of oral presentations, individuals can become more effective communicators and leaders, and help to achieve success in their organizations.<br />

                            30. in your own opinion write a 1,000 words essay about Why does oral presentation related to communication for work purposes?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Read the explanation :).</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Oral presentations are a crucial component of communication in the workplace. They allow individuals to convey information, ideas, and opinions to others in a clear, concise, and effective manner. Oral presentations can be used for a variety of purposes, such as providing updates on a project, pitching a new idea, or presenting findings from research. In this essay, we will discuss why oral presentations are important for communication in the workplace.</p><p>First and foremost, oral presentations provide a platform for individuals to express themselves and their ideas. They allow people to showcase their knowledge and expertise on a particular topic, and demonstrate their ability to communicate effectively. This is particularly important in the workplace, where individuals are often required to collaborate with others and work towards common goals. Through oral presentations, individuals can share their thoughts and ideas with colleagues, receive feedback, and work towards finding solutions to problems.</p><p>Oral presentations are also important for building relationships in the workplace. When individuals present their ideas to others, they are creating a dialogue that can help to build trust and rapport. This can be particularly valuable in team settings, where individuals need to work closely together to achieve a common goal. Oral presentations can help to foster a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, and encourage collaboration among colleagues.</p><p>In addition, oral presentations can be used to persuade and influence others. When individuals have to present their ideas to a group of people, they need to be able to communicate their message clearly and effectively. This requires them to use persuasive techniques, such as storytelling, emotional appeals, and logical arguments, to convince others of the value of their ideas. Persuasion is an important skill in the workplace, where individuals often need to convince others of the validity of their proposals, or sell their products or services to clients.</p><p>Oral presentations can also be used to inform and educate others. When individuals have to present information to others, they need to be able to convey it in a way that is easy to understand and digest. This requires them to use clear, concise language, and to structure their presentation in a logical and organized manner. Informing and educating others is an important part of communication in the workplace, as it helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals.</p><p>Moreover, oral presentations can help individuals to develop their public speaking skills. Public speaking is a valuable skill in the workplace, as it can help individuals to command attention, convey their message effectively, and build credibility with their audience. Through regular practice and feedback, individuals can improve their public speaking skills and become more confident and effective communicators.</p><p>Finally, oral presentations can be used to showcase individuals' abilities and achievements. When individuals present their work to others, they are demonstrating their expertise, creativity, and dedication to their job. This can help to build their reputation within the organization, and may lead to new opportunities for advancement or recognition.</p><p>In conclusion, oral presentations are a critical component of communication in the workplace. They provide a platform for individuals to express themselves and their ideas, build relationships with colleagues, persuade and influence others, inform and educate others, develop public speaking skills, and showcase their abilities and achievements. Through effective oral presentations, individuals can communicate their message clearly and effectively, and work towards achieving their goals in the workplace.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
