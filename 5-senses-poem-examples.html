                            1. 1.identify two examples of personification :explain what being personified &amp; how in each example. 2.identify an example of hyperbole:explain how it is exaggerated. 3.identify an example. Of metaphor:explain which two things are being compered. 4.find three examples of imagery in the poem that access three different senses. Explain which senses are called on by the speaker for each example. 5.contrast the tone of this line "Fathers! Torn and numb, - -" with the tone of the rest of the poem. How is this line different and why do you think it is? 6.this poem was written by an African American poet during the Harlem Renaissance. Knowing this, how might one interpret the "dawn" beyond its literal meaning? What might the dawn represent? 7.what theme is exemplified in the poem? 8.what universal meaning does it convey to us? ​</h2><br />
                        Answer:<p></p>1.The Dawn is awake: dawn is given the human trait of waking.Music singing in the hills: music is given the ability of singing.Voices the new awakening: the Paean is given a voice.The torch of gold is borne: a torches (or suns) are not really born persay.<p></p>2.The dawn of a thousand dreams and thrills: it could be interpreted that this is an exaggeration.A paean of eternal spring: Spring is not eternal. Even the sun will extinguish at some time. This line is an exaggeration.<p></p>3. The torch of gold is borne: this compares the sun to a torch of gold without using the word "like" or "as."The Dawn may have a greater value. See the answer to question 6.<p></p>4.  A flash of smoldering flame and fire: sightWith the mingled fragrance of the trees: smellFathers! torn and numb: touch.<p></p>5. With the exception of this line and the one about the grey skies, the tone in most of the poem is overwhelmingly bright and positive. The reason that this line is there might be to remind readers of the hardships that African Americans had experienced in the past. Or to remind us that not everyone will be able to fully enjoy the nice day, as many will be tearing their bodies in labor and such.<p></p>6. The Dawn may represent the bright awakening of African American culture in America after much cultural repression. Some students may interpret it as representing the freedom of the African Americans after hundreds of years of slavery, and I would accept such an interpretation.<p></p>7. Dawn's awake magically describes the sun how it has raised and how precious its presence is. When we read this poem we will feel like a lots meaning hiding in the poem. Yes every day we want sun without sun we can't imagine the day.<p></p>8. The Dawn may represent the bright awakening of African American culture in America.<p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
