                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In conclusion, allowing children to drink alcohol at an early age can have serious consequences on their physical, mental, and emotional health. It can affect their academic performance, lead to addiction, and even cause long-term health problems. Therefore, it is important for parents, guardians, and society as a whole to work together to prevent children from consuming alcohol at an early age. Parents and guardians should provide guidance and support to their children, educate them about the dangers of alcohol, and encourage them to make healthy and responsible choices. It is our responsibility to protect our children and ensure that they have a healthy and successful future.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Alcohol puts the brakes on your immune system. Your body can't make the numbers of white blood cells it needs to fight germs. So for 24 hours after drinking, you're more likely to get sick. Long-term, heavy drinkers are much more likely to get illnesses like pneumonia and tuberculosis. Alcohol causes more than just trouble for the person drinking, especially with prolonged alcohol misuse and abuse. Because addiction can negatively affect several areas of a person's life, often alcoholism impacts family and friends as well. One way in which alcoholism affects families is in damaged relationships. Families if people affected by alcohol abuse often struggle to create strong emotional bonds, even within their family unit. This stars with the parents.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> HOPE IT HELPS! GOD BLESS </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Smoking and drinking badly affect our health condition. Not only physically but also the way we act is being affected. Though we can't always avoid drinking, it will be helpful if we don't often drink or avoid being addicted to it as possible. Smoking we all know affects our lungs and causes our airways to shrink. In this case, same as the drinking, we should at least lt our smoking or again avoid as much as possible. Avoiding these things would not only make our life longer. It will also prevent us from destroying our body system in such ways. To my opinion, a healthy lifestyle results in healthy living so, preventing a thing that will be bad for us is a help not only to us but also to our family. Smoking and drinking might sound cool and fun but the fact that it destroys our health condition. If we can't stop doing them then limit ourselves and instead make a healthy living rather than bad. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>As a species, we drink a staggering amount of alcohol. The total volume consumed by humans annually is enough to supply every living human with 6.2 liters of alcohol every year [source: WHO]. That's pure alcohol, mind you — not beer or wine or even whiskey, but the kind you should really only drink if you want to get your stomach pumped. Add the fact that 61.7 percent of the world abstains from alcohol, and the share for drinkers rises to 16.3 liters. </p><p></p><p></p><p>All that alcohol going into our bodies absolutely has an effect on human behavior. In 2012, 5.9 percent of all global deaths were attributed to alcohol consumption — that's 3.3 million people dead of alcohol-related health problems, alcohol-related violence and drunken driving [source: WHO]. In the United States alone, 10,076 people died in alcohol-related car accidents in 2013 [source: DOT]. If all alcohol disappeared tomorrow, there definitely would be a global drop in deaths and violence.</p><p></p><p>Without alcohol, maybe we'd still be huddled around campfires arguing about which mushrooms were poisonous and how to avoid being eaten by wolves. Alcohol helped make us what we are, providing clear nutritional benefits and helping to drive the development of agriculture. For something that makes so many of us behave like Neanderthals, alcohol has played a major role in civilization.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Alcohol abuse and addiction (also known as “alcohol use disorder”) doesn’t just affect the person drinking—it affects their families and loved ones, too. Watching a friend or family member struggle with a drinking problem can be as heartbreakingly painful as it is frustrating. Your loved one may be disrupting family life by neglecting their responsibilities, getting into financial and legal difficulties, or mistreating or even abusing you and other family members.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing your loved one’s drinking and the deterioration of your relationship can trigger many distressing emotions, including shame, fear, anger, and self-blame. Your loved one’s addiction may even be so overwhelming that it seems easier to ignore it and pretend that nothing is wrong. But in the long run denying it will only bring more harm to you, your loved one with the problem, and the rest of your family.</p><p></p><p>It’s important to remember that you’re not alone in your struggle. Alcoholism and alcohol abuse affects millions of people, from every social class, race, background, and culture. But there is help available.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, with millions of people around the world using it to connect, share information, and stay informed. While social media can have many positive effects, it also has some negative effects that should be considered.</p><p></p><p>One of the most obvious effects of social media is its ability to connect people from different parts of the world. Social media platforms allow people to connect with friends and family members who live far away, as well as to connect with people who share similar interests. This can help to build strong, supportive communities and to foster a sense of belonging.</p><p></p><p>Another effect of social media is its ability to influence our behavior. Studies have shown that people who spend more time on social media are more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes. This is thought to be because social media can be a powerful influence on our perceptions of what is normal and acceptable. Additionally, social media can be used to promote unhealthy products and lifestyles, which can further contribute to risky behavior.</p><p></p><p>However, social media also has some positive effects. It is a great tool for learning, as it allows users to access a vast array of information and resources.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Alcohol abuse and alcoholism within a family is a problem that can destroy a marriage or drive a wedge between members. That means people who drink can blow through the family budget, cause fights, ignore children, and otherwise impair the health and happiness of the people they love. In time, family members may even develop symptoms of codependency, inadvertently keeping the addiction alive, even though it harms them. Family therapy and rehab can help. Alcoholism, although thought mostly of its impact on the alcoholic themselves, it is also a very present problem in the ruining of his or her friends and their families lives. Someone who may be a fully functional, great person to his or her family may be extremely dangerous, dishonest, and destructive while they are under the influence of alcohol. This instance occurs in "The Glass Castle" with Rex Walls and also occurs regularly in our society today, such as abusive parents, and husbands. Without alcohol Rex was intelligent, responsible, honest, and a overallAlcoholism is having on our society are accidents are happening and people are dying. Another problem that alcoholism is having on our society is people are drinking their problems away and then they end up becoming addicted to alcohol. Alcohol is affecting our society by when people are becoming addicted to alcohol they can become very abusive. Alcoholism is also affects the society by families leaving the alcoholic because of they’re addicted to alcohol. One other way that alcoholism affects our society is people start to gain a lot of weight then they end up being on their way to become obese. Alcohol can also affect our society is some people can end up thinking that alcohol is more important than they’re family </p><p>This affects our society because when the kids of alcoholics feel everything is their fault they will try to right their wrongs which will be their focus which can take a very long time. This is important because when the kids of alcoholics feel hurt they’re going to start to become outcasts which can make them be in the shadow of all the people talking. This affects our society by when people become outcasts they are the people in society who do not say anything in society . This is important because when kids start to feel angry they act out seeking for attention which can make them get in trouble with the law or the students can start getting in trouble school, possibly they can get kicked out if school if they keep on acting </p><p>This is important because when kids of alcoholics are born with physical and mental birth defects they can become outcasts in school. This affects our society by when kids are made fun of because of the physical and birth defects they can start to become overwhelmed and they can start to have suicidal thoughts.</p><p>Alcoholism affects families physically is ‘’Children are more susceptible to child abuse, including incest and battery’’ ( Learn About Alcoholism). This is important because when kids get abused they can start to have bad dreams and experiences of being abused. This affects our society by kids of alcoholics start to have later problems in life and they start to have a difficult time trusting people which can make them outcasts.</p><p>Alcoholism affects families psychologically by “Neglect people from doing their responsibilities with work, home, life, and school’’ (American Addiction). This is important because the people get a distraction that makes them focus on other things that are not going to make their lives better. This affects our society by the families of alcoholics getting distracted they don’t notice that things are not getting better until they take a closer look at what they are doing</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Alcolohol can cause people in addiction that may be can harm anyone's health.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If there was no alcohol, the effects would be far-reaching. For some, abstaining from alcohol could lead to a healthier lifestyle. Alcohol has been linked to numerous health risks, such as high blood pressure, liver disease, and certain types of cancer. By eliminating alcohol consumption, individuals could reduce their risk of developing these conditions.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the spectrum, there would be a number of social implications if alcohol was no longer available. Many people enjoy having a few drinks with friends or family as a way to relax or celebrate an occasion. Without alcohol, social gatherings could become much less enjoyable. Additionally, some businesses, such as bars, breweries, and wineries, would suffer if alcohol was no longer sold.</p><p></p><p>Finally, alcohol consumption is often linked to risky behavior, such as driving under the influence. While these behaviors can be dangerous, it is important to note that most people are capable of drinking responsibly. Without alcohol, people may be more likely to engage in other activities that might put their safety and the safety of others at risk.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, if there was no alcohol, the effects would be both positive and negative. On the one hand, people could reduce their risk of developing certain health conditions. On the other hand, social gatherings and businesses could suffer, and people may engage in other potentially dangerous activities.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>May compare and contrast na cguro po yan, bago po yan</p><br />
