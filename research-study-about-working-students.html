                                            Practical Research
A research study conducted by Torrendon (2017) entitled Difficulties Encountered by the Student Researchers and the Influences on their Research Output revealed that most student researchers have difficulties focus on conflicts in time management. They cannot proceed if most of the time their minds are pre-occupied. When doing a research paper, you must have an enough time to work on. Additionally, having not enough background knowledge is also a factor that affects them since choosing for a research topic will be easy if you have observed well and been listening to the discussions. Lastly, not all of them are having their own media devices that can help them improve their output. There are a lot of ways on how are you going to find those.

Bella, a graduating student, claimed the research work of her classmate. She erased the name of the original researcher and placed her own.2. Joseph, the class president, forced his classmates to participate in his study. 3. A group of research students secretly chose their adviser as the subject of their research. 4. Sheila, an honor student, ranked last in the honor roll because of non- participation in extra-curricular activities. A qualitative research about her is conducted without informing her.5. Delbert, a senior high school student, is planning to carry out his first research on the misbehavior of fellow students during examinations. However, he has no idea on the ethical guidelines in conducting such research. ​</a>

Frequency count, percentage,mean, and chi-square were used as statistical tools. Results revealed that financialproblem was the main factor that motivated the students to work on-campus. Theyexperienced varied feelings as happiness, sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite workpressure, working students had good time management both for studies and work, withhigh self-esteem and good academic performance. The study concluded that participants'dual roles in the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helpingthesestudents, especially on their financial needs for them to finish their studies.2.

Importance : _____________________________________________Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this study explored the livedexperiences and struggles of 22 on-campus working students of ISAT U-MiagaoCampus. This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire andinterview in gathering information about their experiences and related variables.Frequency count, percentage, mean, and chi-square were used as statisticaltools. Results revealed that financial problem was the main factor that motivatedthe students to work on-campus. They experienced varied feelings as happiness,sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite work pressure, working students hadgood time management both for studies and work, with high self-esteem andgood academic performance. The study concluded that participants’ dual rolesin the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helpingthese students, especially on their financial needs for them to finish theirstudies.​</a>

In this lesson, we focused on sharing experiences and knowledge in
research. It is important to remember that:
• Research is a systematic inquiry to describe, explain, predict,
and control the observed phenomenon.
• Research allows a student to pursue interests, to learn
something new, to hone problem-solving skills and to challenge
one's self in new ways.
Reasons in conducting research includes: 1.) Gain hands-on
experience completing a research project; 2.) Work closely with
peers, other researchers and teachers; 3.)
Hone leadership and teamwork skills as you collaborate with
others; 4.) Learn valuable lessons for life and class; 5.) Gain a
deeper understanding of the scientific process; and 6.) Have the
opportunity to discover new knowledge and expand about what
you already know
Some purposes of research are: 1.) To advance some area of
scientific knowledge or to undercut some other area of scientific
knowledge; 2.) It is exciting, cool, or even beneficial for
humanity; 3.) Because you like the people in the community of
researchers and want to be with them; 4.) To get knowledge and
experience to be a better student; and 5.) To make a name in
school
Some of the benefits of research are: 1.) Enhances knowledge;
2.) Clarifies confusion; 3.) To have a proper understanding of the
subject; 4.) To learn about the methods and issues; 5.)
Understand the published work; 6.) Learn to create a balance
between collaborative and individual work; 7.) To know the
interest; 8.) To know how the original study originated; and 9.)
Understanding the rationale.

A research study conducted by Torrendon (2017) entitled Difficulties Encountered by the Student Researchers and the Influences on their Research Output revealed that most student researchers have difficulties focus on conflicts in time management. They cannot proceed if most of the time their minds are pre-occupied. When doing a research paper, you must have an enough time to work on. Additionally, having not enough background knowledge is also a factor that affects them since choosing for a research topic will be easy if you have observed well and been listening to the discussions. Lastly, not all of them are having their own media devices that can help them improve their output. There are a lot of ways on how are you going to find those. 
What can you say about the findings of the conducted research of Torrendo?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Finding a good topic is essential to producing quality research output. This can be difficult for student researchers, who may lack the background knowledge to identify good topics. Additionally, time management is crucial for research papers. Student researchers may have difficulty focusing on their work if they are preoccupied with other things. Lastly, having access to media devices can improve research output. However, not all student researchers have their own media devices. The findings of the Torrendo study suggest that these factors can influence the quality of student research output.</p><p></p><br />

However, he has no idea on the ethical guidelines in conducting such research. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Ethical guidelines for research </strong>- Norms support the objectives of research, including knowledge, accuracy, and mistake prevention.</p><p>       By adhering to ethical standards, you can make sure that your study is accurate and authentic and increase your reputation and public support. Also, while presenting your findings in your publication, you must follow ethical standards.</p><p><strong>Safeguarding human subjects:</strong></p>Respect human dignity, privacy, and autonomy when doing research on living beings; limit risks and damages, and maximize benefits.<p><strong>Courtesy for privacy:</strong></p>Relationships between the rights to beneficence, respect for dignity, and loyalty and the question of secrecy and anonymity are intricate. Because personal comments cannot be connected to the identify of the subject, anonymity is safeguarded. If the researcher is unable to guarantee anonymity, he must deal with confidentiality, which is the handling of personal data by the researcher in order to safeguard the subject's identity.<p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong></p>As well as health information, commercial or military secrets, articles or grants that have been submitted for publication or that have been awarded confidentially should also be protected.<p><strong>Colleagues should be respected:</strong></p>You should respect and be fair to your coworkers.<p><strong>Non-Discrimination:</strong></p>Keep your coworkers from being treated unfairly<p><strong>Honesty:</strong></p>Honestly describe the information, findings, techniques, and status of publications. Don't make up, falsify, or represent data incorrectly.Never cite someone else's work as your own. Before using the original researcher's data or results, get their permission first. Afterwards, give due acknowledgment to the study effort. Don't make study participants participate against their will. To safeguard individual freedom and objectivity, participants in study should actively and knowingly provide their consent. Ask prospective participants the right questions, be clear about the procedures you'll follow, and provide any additional details necessary for the review of your study. The social duty of a researcher is to use their findings to advance social good and to stop or lessen societal ills. Notify the advisor and first get approval from them. Find another study subject who is willing if the adviser didn't provide authorization.Sheila should be informed and given the go-ahead beforehand. Find a different willing research subject if she declines.Before beginning the actual study, it is crucial to get familiar with research ethics. Delbert needs to be mindful of the need to protect human subjects, maintain participant confidentiality, and show respect for his coworkers. In addition, he should report the statistics honestly and without discrimination.<p>Learn more about <strong>Research</strong>: https://brainly.in/question/25724853</p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><p></p><br />

I needed something I could control and grades provided that for me. The research perspective I learned in classes also made me feel more in control at doctor and therapy appointments. Around Finn's third birthday, he reached age level on all developmental and physical tasks. I transitioned from being a caregiver to "just" a parent. The shift was profound. It had a significant impact on my lived experience as a parent, my lived experience as a student, and my lived experience of health. The worry that consumed me, and the exhaustion I felt as a caregiver dissipated when my role was reduced to parent. I was able to focus on my studies in a more balanced way and I had the energy to build relationships with fellow students in my program.

                            8. Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this study explored the lived experiences and struggles of 22, on-campus working students of ISAT U-Miagao Campus. This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire and interview in gathering information about their experiences and related variables. Frequency count, percentage, mean, and chi-square were used as statistical tools. Results revealed that financial problem was the main factor that motivated the students to work on-campus. They experienced varied feelings as happiness, sadness, annoyance, and worry.

This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire andinterview in gathering information about their experiences and related variables.Frequency count, percentage, mean, and chi-square were used as statisticaltools. Results revealed that financial problem was the main factor that motivatedthe students to work on-campus. They experienced varied feelings as happiness,sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite work pressure, working students hadgood time management both for studies and work, with high self-esteem andgood academic performance. The study concluded that participants’ dual rolesin the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helpingthese students, especially on their financial needs for them to finish theirstudies.​</h2><br />

                            27. .
In this lesson, we focused on sharing experiences and knowledge in
research. It is important to remember that:
• Research is a systematic inquiry to describe, explain, predict,
and control the observed phenomenon.
• Research allows a student to pursue interests, to learn
something new, to hone problem-solving skills and to challenge
one's self in new ways.
Reasons in conducting research includes: 1.) Gain hands-on
experience completing a research project; 2.) Work closely with
peers, other researchers and teachers; 3.)
Hone leadership and teamwork skills as you collaborate with
others; 4.) Learn valuable lessons for life and class; 5.) Gain a
deeper understanding of the scientific process; and 6.) Have the
opportunity to discover new knowledge and expand about what
you already know
Some purposes of research are: 1.) To advance some area of
scientific knowledge or to undercut some other area of scientific
knowledge; 2.) It is exciting, cool, or even beneficial for
humanity; 3.) Because you like the people in the community of
researchers and want to be with them; 4.) To get knowledge and
experience to be a better student; and 5.) To make a name in
school
Some of the benefits of research are: 1.) Enhances knowledge;
2.) Clarifies confusion; 3.) To have a proper understanding of the
subject; 4.) To learn about the methods and issues; 5.)
Understand the published work; 6.) Learn to create a balance
between collaborative and individual work; 7.) To know the
interest; 8.) To know how the original study originated; and 9.)
Understanding the rationale.
