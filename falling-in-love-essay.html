She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story.

It seemed to be sobeneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act(similarly. For children,having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, imate for sharingnumerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help inthe time of need. Howevery having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins.share many interests: they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in anyother relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits.The advantages of being a twin are especiall evident in the early childhood years. In the earlyyears, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Siblingrivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birthFurthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense ofsupport and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs oflife and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support whichbuilds their relationship and creates trust between themIn contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacyand sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and fromparents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both becamewuccessful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012.para 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. Thetwins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remainstangiyatatamaran​</a>

I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist. I was attached to General MacArthur’s staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was order to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan. From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequenSeeeneral MacArthur, aided by Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation. The second I was called upon to make considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convince that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president— started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration. Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, I was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramon Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. i could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself. Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, I left for the United States.​</a>

                                            He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                                            For items 6-10, read the passage below to answer the following items. It is odd, but in our family, love always began with a fall of some form or another. This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

And the sweetest and warmest sunshine, Comes after the storm and gloom. So, the heart, from the hardest trial, Gains the purest joy of all. And from the lips that have tasted sadness, The sweetest songs will fall. For as peace comes after suffering, And love is reward of pain So, after earth, comes Heaven, And out of loss, is gain.​</a>

                                            Read the selection below. Then answer the questions provided. Write the letter of the correct answer.Life has its disappointments and many of them are far from trivial. The birth of a defective child, the loss of a job the disintegration of a romance, the death of a loved one - such are some of the major traumas all must go through at one time or another. And even those who seem capable of coping with minor letdowns sometimes fall apart when some major disappointments come along.	There are different ways of reacting to life’s vicissitudes. Some try to cope by fleeing reality. They may occupy their minds with various forms of entertainment, devotion to some cause or pursuit of some goal. They may seek relief through drugs, alcohol, or even suicide. Others may handle them by rewarding themselves to make up for what they have had to endure.	Such reactions may soften life’s blows by diverting one’s attention. But, life has to go on so think of a better way. One that comes to terms with reality. It has to do with understanding the purpose of life and maintaining one’s stability.	Life is not a dead-end road. It leads to somewhere. The disappointments, the trials, the problems as we all encounter are not meant to be roadblocks. They are hurdles. Their purpose is to strengthen us, not to defeat us. The realization of this monumental truth can change a person’s perspective and enable him or her to deal with adversity.Source: It’s a Question of Perspective (Excerpt). Clayton Steep6. What value is highlighted in the essay? *1 pointA. giving upB. losing hopeC. accepting defeatD. overcoming trials​</a>

Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say.

He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

And even those who seem capable of coping with minor letdowns sometimes fall apart when some major disappointments come along.	There are different ways of reacting to life’s vicissitudes. Some try to cope by fleeing reality. They may occupy their minds with various forms of entertainment, devotion to some cause or pursuit of some goal. They may seek relief through drugs, alcohol, or even suicide. Others may handle them by rewarding themselves to make up for what they have had to endure.	Such reactions may soften life’s blows by diverting one’s attention. But, life has to go on so think of a better way. One that comes to terms with reality. It has to do with understanding the purpose of life and maintaining one’s stability.	Life is not a dead-end road. It leads to somewhere. The disappointments, the trials, the problems as we all encounter are not meant to be roadblocks. They are hurdles. Their purpose is to strengthen us, not to defeat us. The realization of this monumental truth can change a person’s perspective and enable him or her to deal with adversity.Source: It’s a Question of Perspective (Excerpt). Clayton Steep6.

"This I Believe" by: Carlos P. Romulo
I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist.
I was attached to General Macarthur's staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called the Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was ordered to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan.
From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequences to my family. I did not see them again until after the liberation of my country by the American forces under General Macarthur, aided by the Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation.
The second time was called upon to make a considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during the 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convinced that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president. I founded a third party, the Democratic Party, and accepted the nomination for president-started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration.
Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they would present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramón Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. I could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself.
Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, left for the United States.
As look back, see this pattern of action and renunciation repeated over and over again in my life-in things great and small, in war and in peace. Some may call this a credo of self-sacrifice. I prefer to describe it as being true to one's self, no matter what the cost.</a>

Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</a>

You may modify the sample outline format presented before. This I Believe Carlos P. Romulo I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist. I was attached to General MacArthur’s staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was order to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan. From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequenSeeeneral MacArthur, aided by Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation. The second I was called upon to make considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convince that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president— started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration. Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, I was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramon Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. i could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself. Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, I left for the United States.​</h2><br />

                            8. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

And the woods must be cold and silent, Before the robins sing, The flowers must be buried in darkness, Before they can bud and bloom. And the sweetest and warmest sunshine, Comes after the storm and gloom. So, the heart, from the hardest trial, Gains the purest joy of all. And from the lips that have tasted sadness, The sweetest songs will fall. For as peace comes after suffering, And love is reward of pain So, after earth, comes Heaven, And out of loss, is gain.​</h2><br />

The poem speaks of the natural cycles of life, where every pleasant experience is preceded by a period of hardship, sorrow, or pain.</p><p></p><p>The first stanza compares the winter to the spring, and how one cannot truly appreciate the latter without having gone through the former. It also mentions the quietness of the woods before the birds start singing, reminding us that sometimes silence is necessary before something beautiful can happen. The second stanza speaks of the darkness that flowers must be buried in before they can bloom, and how the sunshine that follows a storm is the sweetest and warmest.</p><p></p><p>The third stanza shifts the focus to the human heart, which gains the purest joy of all from enduring the hardest trials. The poem suggests that it is through pain and sadness that we can truly appreciate and express happiness and joy. The final stanza reinforces this idea by suggesting that peace and love are the rewards of suffering, and that Heaven comes after life on earth, and gain is born out of loss.</p><p></p><p>The poem's message resonates with me on a personal level. I have gone through some difficult experiences in my life, but looking back, I realize that those experiences have helped me grow and become a stronger person. I have learned to appreciate the good things in life more deeply because of the hardships I have endured. The poem reminds me that even in difficult times, there is hope for a brighter future.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, "Lessons on Experience" is a poignant reminder that we must endure difficult experiences in order to truly appreciate the beauty and joy that life has to offer. The poem's message is one that can provide comfort and hope to anyone going through a difficult time. It encourages us to embrace the challenges we face and to trust that they will ultimately lead us to a better place.</p><br />

                            12. Read the selection below. Then answer the questions provided. Write the letter of the correct answer.Life has its disappointments and many of them are far from trivial. The birth of a defective child, the loss of a job the disintegration of a romance, the death of a loved one - such are some of the major traumas all must go through at one time or another. And even those who seem capable of coping with minor letdowns sometimes fall apart when some major disappointments come along.	There are different ways of reacting to life’s vicissitudes. Some try to cope by fleeing reality. They may occupy their minds with various forms of entertainment, devotion to some cause or pursuit of some goal. They may seek relief through drugs, alcohol, or even suicide. Others may handle them by rewarding themselves to make up for what they have had to endure.	Such reactions may soften life’s blows by diverting one’s attention. But, life has to go on so think of a better way. One that comes to terms with reality. It has to do with understanding the purpose of life and maintaining one’s stability.	Life is not a dead-end road. It leads to somewhere. The disappointments, the trials, the problems as we all encounter are not meant to be roadblocks. They are hurdles. Their purpose is to strengthen us, not to defeat us. The realization of this monumental truth can change a person’s perspective and enable him or her to deal with adversity.Source: It’s a Question of Perspective (Excerpt). Clayton Steep6.

Read the following narrative essay: 
Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

Read the following narrative essay: 
I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

The causal events of a plot can be thought of as a series of events linked by the connector "and so".

                            19. Read the selection below. Then answer the questions provided. Write the letter of the correct answer.Life has its disappointments and many of them are far from trivial. The birth of a defective child, the loss of a job the disintegration of a romance, the death of a loved one - such are some of the major traumas all must go through at one time or another. And even those who seem capable of coping with minor letdowns sometimes fall apart when some major disappointments come along.	There are different ways of reacting to life’s vicissitudes. Some try to cope by fleeing reality. They may occupy their minds with various forms of entertainment, devotion to some cause or pursuit of some goal. They may seek relief through drugs, alcohol, or even suicide. Others may handle them by rewarding themselves to make up for what they have had to endure.	Such reactions may soften life’s blows by diverting one’s attention. But, life has to go on so think of a better way. One that comes to terms with reality. It has to do with understanding the purpose of life and maintaining one’s stability.	Life is not a dead-end road. It leads to somewhere. The disappointments, the trials, the problems as we all encounter are not meant to be roadblocks. They are hurdles. Their purpose is to strengthen us, not to defeat us. The realization of this monumental truth can change a person’s perspective and enable him or her to deal with adversity.Source: It’s a Question of Perspective (Excerpt). Clayton Steep6.

"This I Believe" by: Carlos P. Romulo
I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist.
I was attached to General Macarthur's staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called the Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was ordered to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan.
From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequences to my family. I did not see them again until after the liberation of my country by the American forces under General Macarthur, aided by the Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation.
The second time was called upon to make a considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during the 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convinced that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president. I founded a third party, the Democratic Party, and accepted the nomination for president-started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration.
Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they would present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramón Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. I could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself.
Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, left for the United States.
As look back, see this pattern of action and renunciation repeated over and over again in my life-in things great and small, in war and in peace. Some may call this a credo of self-sacrifice. I prefer to describe it as being true to one's self, no matter what the cost.</h2><br />

She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story.

Twin College Essay: The Benefits of Being a Twin Perhaps almost everyone has dreamed of having a twin in their childhood. It seemed to be so beneficial to have an identical copy of oneself that would think and act similarly. For children, having a twin means to have a reliable friend throughout their whole lives, a mate for sharing numerous jokes and playing games, or an invaluable assistant who would always come to help in the time of need. However, having a twin doesn't lose its advantages even in the adult age. Twins share many interests; they often form bonds that, due to their unique nature, are not possible in any other relationship and it lasts forever. Therefore, being a twin has many benefits. The advantages of being a twin are especially evident in the early childhood years. "In the early years, the twin children develop trust between themselves" (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 2). Sibling rivalry is not such a problem because the kids form an attachment to each other from birth, Furthermore, at an early age, twins need each other because they give each other a sense of support and security. The twins are there for each other as they experience the ups and downs of life and growing up. Academically, socially and emotionally, twins offer each other support which builds their relationship and creates trust between them. In contrast, the teenage years offer more insight into the disadvantages of being a twin. Privacy and sexuality become more important, and rivalry for the attention of the opposite sex and from parents comes into play. For example, in the film Dead Ringers, two identical twins both became successful gynecologists and ended up falling in love with the same woman (Safdarmehdi, 2012, para. 3). After the teenage years, this rivalry and tension between the twins usually fade away. The twins get married and become involved with their own new families. They do not worry as muchabout what the other twin is up to. However, a close bond between the twins usually still remains.​</h2><br />
