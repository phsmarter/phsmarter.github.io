When you woke up this morning, did you think today would be the day you save a life? In fact, it's quite easy to save a life and it only takes a little bit of your time.

Sample Conclusion #1: This concludes the essay example above on the topic of donating blood. Note how it emphasizes the simplicity of the process. The process of donating blood is decidedly simple.

                                            Exercise 5. Write For A Purpose: Do you know how many overseas Filipino workers are working in the Middle East? Or how many Filipino nurses are employed in the United States and England? You can learn about these when you write a report. A report is a composition that makes use of information from books, magazines, newspapers, the internet and other sources. Here are some steps that can help you write your report. 1. Write about a subject that interests you. Look through books on it. Encyclopedias, almanacs, dictionaries, and magazines are good sources of your needed data. You can also surf the internet for more data. 2. Take notes as you go through your sources. Writing the facts on index cards will help you organize the information you need. You can easily refer to your notes as you write the report. Remember to write the data you gathered in your own words. Jotting down the key words is also helpful. 3. Arrange your notes in a logical order. Go over them and classify them into main ideas and supporting details. Be sure to discard the notes that do not fit into these headings. 4. Make an outline to arrange your information. 5. Write your report. Remember that a report has three main parts. The introduction states the main idea and should capture the interest of your readers. The middle paragraphs or the body of the report gives the facts of the report. Each paragraph usually states the main topic and is supported to subtopics. To achieve unity and smooth flow thought, signal words such as first, then, finally, in addition to, and also may be used. The ending paragraph signals the end of your report. A good ending must be clear. It may summarize the main ideas or state your opinion on the topic. A. List possible subjects for a report. You can brainstorm on other interesting subjects. Then select one that interests you. Gather data from primary or secondary sources and write notes about it. Organize your notes and make an outline. Then write aa draft of your report B. Edit your report. The following questions can help you proofread. 1. Is the topic clearly stated in the introduction? Will the readers be interested in reading your report? 2. Does the body of the report contains relevant information? 3. Does each paragraph start with a new topic? Are there supporting details in each paragraph? 4. Is the ending clear enough to let the readers know that the report is finished?​</a>

                            20. Sample Introduction #1: This essay discusses the topic of donating blood. When you woke up this morning, did you think today would be the day you save a life? In fact, it's quite easy to save a life and it only takes a little bit of your time. You don't even need to be a paramedic or firefighter. All you have to do is set aside approximately one hour to donate blood. This essay will explore how to donate blood, whom it benefits, and how often you can contribute to these life-saving measures. Sample Conclusion #1: This concludes the essay example above on the topic of donating blood. Note how it emphasizes the simplicity of the process. The process of donating blood is decidedly simple. Many folks carry out the process while reading a chapter from a new book or watching an episode of their favorite TV show. Indeed, the infinitesimal amount of time it takes to donate blood can transfer into a lifetime of happiness for the recipient. Remember to bring juice or something sugary to keep your glucose levels high at the end of the procedure. Then, hold your head up high, knowing there's a life out there that's about to be saved by you. Questions: 1. How do you find the sample introduction? 2.

                            24. Exercise 5. Write For A Purpose: Do you know how many overseas Filipino workers are working in the Middle East? Or how many Filipino nurses are employed in the United States and England? You can learn about these when you write a report. A report is a composition that makes use of information from books, magazines, newspapers, the internet and other sources. Here are some steps that can help you write your report. 1. Write about a subject that interests you. Look through books on it. Encyclopedias, almanacs, dictionaries, and magazines are good sources of your needed data. You can also surf the internet for more data. 2. Take notes as you go through your sources. Writing the facts on index cards will help you organize the information you need. You can easily refer to your notes as you write the report. Remember to write the data you gathered in your own words. Jotting down the key words is also helpful. 3. Arrange your notes in a logical order. Go over them and classify them into main ideas and supporting details. Be sure to discard the notes that do not fit into these headings. 4. Make an outline to arrange your information. 5. Write your report. Remember that a report has three main parts. The introduction states the main idea and should capture the interest of your readers. The middle paragraphs or the body of the report gives the facts of the report. Each paragraph usually states the main topic and is supported to subtopics. To achieve unity and smooth flow thought, signal words such as first, then, finally, in addition to, and also may be used. The ending paragraph signals the end of your report. A good ending must be clear. It may summarize the main ideas or state your opinion on the topic. A. List possible subjects for a report. You can brainstorm on other interesting subjects. Then select one that interests you. Gather data from primary or secondary sources and write notes about it. Organize your notes and make an outline. Then write aa draft of your report B. Edit your report. The following questions can help you proofread. 1. Is the topic clearly stated in the introduction? Will the readers be interested in reading your report? 2. Does the body of the report contains relevant information? 3. Does each paragraph start with a new topic? Are there supporting details in each paragraph? 4. Is the ending clear enough to let the readers know that the report is finished?​</h2><br />
