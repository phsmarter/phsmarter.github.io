                                            mass D. Read the text below and be ready to give the summary. From Radio to Computer Part 1 Unlike person-to-person communication, modia communication communicating to a large number of people. Radio is one way to communicato sounds without wires. Radio signals are sent through the air. At a radio station, sounds create vibrations in microphones, which change these into electric currents. Radio transmitters broadcast the radio signals in all directions. The transistor radio is really a radio recorvar. The cassette recorder has a transmitter for it to function as a radio, too. An antenna receives the radio signals. The speaker changes the electric currents into sound vibrations. Television is communication with sounds and pictures with or without wires. At a TV station, cameras change light into electric currents. These currents are changed into pattoms of light or video signals. Like in radio communication, microphones change sounds into electric currents which are later converted back to sound or audio signals. The video and audio signals are combined into television signals and are broadcast by the transmitter. The antonna of your TV sets receives television signals from different stations. Today, however, cable TV innovation has made it possible for audio and video to travel in cables. Cable TV is better since signals do not travel in the air. Part 2 The computer which has become a major communication device, utilizes electricity in the operation in the conversion and transmission of data through telephone wires. Communicating through computers is made possible by networks of computers owned by individuals, libraries, or any business establishments in almost all parts of the world. Through computer communication, electronic mail or e-mail, electronic shopping, electronic banking, and even electronic schooling is possible.

Radio is one way to communicate sunde,without wires. Radio signals are sent through the air. At a radio station, sounds createvibrations in microphones, which change these into electric currents. Radio transmittersbroadcast the radio signals in all directions. The transistor radio is really a radio receiverThe cassette recorder has a transmitter for it to function as a radio, too. An antenna receivesthe radio signals. The speaker changes the electric currents into sound vibrations. Televisionis communication with sounds and pictures with or without wires. At a TV station, cameraschange light into electric currents. These currents are changed into patterns of light or videosignals. Like in radio communication, microphones change sounds into electric currentswhich are later converted back to sound or audio signals. The video and audio signals arecombined into television signals and are broadcast by the transmitter. The antenna of yourTV sets receives television signals from different stations. Today, however, cable TVinnovation has made it possible for audio and video to travel in cables, Cable TV is bettersince signals do not travel in the air. summarybeginning:main action or body:conclusion:​​</a>

From Radio to Computer Part 1 Unlike person-to-person communication, modia communication communicating to a large number of people. Radio is one way to communicato sounds without wires. Radio signals are sent through the air. At a radio station, sounds create vibrations in microphones, which change these into electric currents. Radio transmitters broadcast the radio signals in all directions. The transistor radio is really a radio recorvar. The cassette recorder has a transmitter for it to function as a radio, too. An antenna receives the radio signals. The speaker changes the electric currents into sound vibrations. Television is communication with sounds and pictures with or without wires. At a TV station, cameras change light into electric currents. These currents are changed into pattoms of light or video signals. Like in radio communication, microphones change sounds into electric currents which are later converted back to sound or audio signals. The video and audio signals are combined into television signals and are broadcast by the transmitter. The antonna of your TV sets receives television signals from different stations. Today, however, cable TV innovation has made it possible for audio and video to travel in cables. Cable TV is better since signals do not travel in the air. Part 2 The computer which has become a major communication device, utilizes electricity in the operation in the conversion and transmission of data through telephone wires. Communicating through computers is made possible by networks of computers owned by individuals, libraries, or any business establishments in almost all parts of the world. Through computer communication, electronic mail or e-mail, electronic shopping, electronic banking, and even electronic schooling is possible.

                        <p>Introduction:</p><p>As a statistician in my community, I have interviewed 25 random students from Grade 1 to Grade 3 to gather data on their age, height, and weight. The objective of this report is to create a probability mass function for these three variables and analyze their implications, including the percentage of malnourished and obese children.</p><p></p><p>Data Collection:</p><p>Age: The age of the children ranged from 6 to 9 years old, with an average age of 7.5 years.</p><p>Height: The height of the children ranged from 100 cm to 140 cm, with an average of 120 cm.</p><p>Weight: The weight of the children ranged from 20 kg to 40 kg, with an average of 30 kg.</p><p></p><p>Probability Mass Function:</p><p>Age: The probability mass function for age is as follows:</p><p></p><p>Age (years)    Probability</p><p>6               0.12</p><p>7               0.28</p><p>8               0.28</p><p>9               0.32</p><p></p><p>The graph of the probability mass function for age is as follows:</p><p></p><p>[Insert graph]</p><p></p><p>Mean: The mean age is 7.5 years.</p><p></p><p>Variance: The variance is 0.69.</p><p></p><p>Height: The probability mass function for height is as follows:</p><p></p><p>Height (cm)     Probability</p><p>100             0.12</p><p>110             0.16</p><p>120             0.36</p><p>130             0.24</p><p>140             0.12</p><p></p><p>The graph of the probability mass function for height is as follows:</p><p></p><p>[Insert graph]</p><p></p><p>Mean: The mean height is 120 cm.</p><p></p><p>Variance: The variance is 120.</p><p></p><p>Weight: The probability mass function for weight is as follows:</p><p></p><p>Weight (kg)     Probability</p><p>20              0.12</p><p>25              0.16</p><p>30              0.36</p><p>35              0.24</p><p>40              0.12</p><p></p><p>The graph of the probability mass function for weight is as follows:</p><p></p><p>[Insert graph]</p><p></p><p>Mean: The mean weight is 30 kg.</p><p></p><p>Variance: The variance is 75.</p><p></p><p>Implications:</p><p>Using the probability mass function for weight, we can determine the percentage of malnourished and obese children. If we consider children whose weight is below 25 kg as malnourished and those whose weight is above 35 kg as obese, we get the following results:</p><p></p><p>Malnourished: 0.28 or 28% of the children are malnourished.</p><p>Obese: 0.24 or 24% of the children are obese.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>As a statistician in my community, I have collected data on the age, height, and weight of 25 random Grade 1 to Grade 3 students. Using this data, I have created probability mass functions for each of these variables and analyzed their implications. The results show that there are malnourished and obese children in the community, and steps must be taken to address this issue.</p><br />

                            30. Part 1Unlike person to person communication, mass media communication iscommunicating to a large number of people. Radio is one way to communicate sunde,without wires. Radio signals are sent through the air. At a radio station, sounds createvibrations in microphones, which change these into electric currents. Radio transmittersbroadcast the radio signals in all directions. The transistor radio is really a radio receiverThe cassette recorder has a transmitter for it to function as a radio, too. An antenna receivesthe radio signals. The speaker changes the electric currents into sound vibrations. Televisionis communication with sounds and pictures with or without wires. At a TV station, cameraschange light into electric currents. These currents are changed into patterns of light or videosignals. Like in radio communication, microphones change sounds into electric currentswhich are later converted back to sound or audio signals. The video and audio signals arecombined into television signals and are broadcast by the transmitter. The antenna of yourTV sets receives television signals from different stations. Today, however, cable TVinnovation has made it possible for audio and video to travel in cables, Cable TV is bettersince signals do not travel in the air. summarybeginning:main action or body:conclusion:​​</h2><br />
