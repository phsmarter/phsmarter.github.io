                            27. why would sanitation be Incorporated into the hiring of food service staff?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Employees and managers need to see food safety procedures as much a part of their job as punching the time clock and getting paid. Often employees and managers give lip service to food safety. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Most of us realize the need to be accountable for our work, but very few people know how to actually make that a reality. People have different interpretations of what being accountable means. For example, if I were the cook, I would thoroughly clean all areas of my work area before I left for the day. Someone else might consider it good enough to just wipe off the main area and not clean behind or under anything.</p><br />

                            29. if you will own a food service someday, what will be your basis in hiring your staff?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Ware-washing:
</p><p>The persons washing up are as important as any other key employee.
</p><p>These people keep your operation running. They not only clean, they organize!
</p><p>They are responsible for putting EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE.
</p><p>Their performance, above all others, prevents food poisoning and creates order.
</p><p>The “dishwasher” may also do basic food prep and help receive and put away
</p><p>deliveries. They often know as much or more about how to take apart and
</p><p>reassemble equipment plus what to do to keep things running properly. Take the
</p><p>time to hire and train these people well.
</p><p>Setting up the Washing Area:
</p><p>Inspect the dishwasher for cleanliness. Clean if necessary.
</p><p>Check the chemical levels. Fill as required.
</p><p>Assemble the machine, if left dis-assembled.
</p><p>Fill and run a few cycles to assure proper chemical levels, if necessary.
</p><p>Straighten out racks and shelves of pots, pans, trays, bowls, boards. Nest if dry.
</p><p>Set up the pot-washing sinks: Wash - Rinse - Sanitize. Clear drain board.
</p><p>Assemble tools: scrapers, squeegees.
</p><p>Check and refill hand-washing station stocks: bacteriostatic soap, paper towels.
</p><p>Line and distribute trash receptacles.
</p><p>Running the station:
</p><p>Check the sanitizer strength (often chlorine) with test strips every 2 hours.
</p><p>Empty, clean and refill the machine as needed or at least every other hour.
</p><p>Keep the floor dry near the dish area.
</p><p>Let all items air dry before putting away.
</p><p>Avoid excessive dumping of fibrous foods into the disposal.
</p><p>Avoid putting large amounts of starchy foods into the drains: rice, cereals.
</p><p>(They swell in your pipes and clog them.)
</p><p>Avoid putting fats into the drains: shortenings, icings, oils, butters.
</p><p>(They congeal in your pipes and clog them.)
</p><p>Keep paper out of the disposal.
</p><p>Fold down partially full trash can liners and stack new ones on top.
</p><p>(This keeps the bags light enough to lift out without splitting.)
</p><p>Notify the chef if the station is caught up and other duties can be assigned.
</p><p>Cleanliness
</p><p>Personnel:
</p><p>Bathe Daily. Use deodorant. Wear no cologne or after-shave.
</p><p>Restrain hair: Wear a hat (or net) and tuck hair into it.
</p><p>Francis Lynch - ChefDesk 1997
</p><p>Wear a clean full uniform ( jacket, long pants, apron, hat)
</p><p>Name tags and scarf, if part of the uniform
</p><p>Wear closed-toed, non-skid, non-absorbent shoes
</p><p>Hands:
</p><p>Wash hands with sanitizing cleaners for at least 20 seconds
</p><p>Dry with a disposable towel.
</p><p>Wash whenever finished cutting raw meats … and after:
</p><p>Going to the toilet
</p><p>A break
</p><p>Using the phone
</p><p>and … whenever they become soiled.
</p><p>Floors:
</p><p>Wipe all spills immediately and thoroughly - Do not use that towel again for prep.
</p><p>Sweep floors frequently and always before and after each “rush” period.
</p><p>Work / Prep Tables:
</p><p>Use Cutting Boards
</p><p> Sanitize any board and knives used for cutting raw meats
</p><p>Keep the items on work tables organized - Do not crowd the tabletop.
</p><p>Keep all knives visible: Do not cover knives with food, towels, etc.
</p><p>Wipe up spills right away.
</p><p>Work with CLEAN towels.
</p><p>Small Appliances:
</p><p>Pay close attention whenever using equipment with moving parts.
</p><p>Use appliances according to their instructional manuals.
</p><p>Do not overload blenders, food processors, mixers, fryers.
</p><p>Do not leave mixing/chopping appliances running un-attended.
</p><p>Unplug electrical appliances before cleaning, assembling or disassembling.
</p><p>Wipe clean after each use.
</p><p>Store attachments (lids, blades, hooks, paddles, whips, etc.) in their right place.
</p><p>Drawers &amp; Shelves:
</p><p>Store knives so they are visible and will not fall or be covered - NOT in drawers.
</p><p>Before opening a new food container, be sure the old one is used up - not “lost”.
</p><p>Avoid stacking items to the point they become unstable.
</p><p>Large Heating Appliances: Ovens, ranges, broilers, etc.
</p><p>Wipe up all spills immediately.
</p><p>Monitor temperatures on a set schedule: once per shift. Enter readings in a log.

</p><p>Wrap, label and date all items.
</p><p>Store items in their designated spots.
</p><p>Empty and clean refrigerators at least weekly.
</p><p> Storage Guidelines:
</p><p>Thaw foods in the refrigerators as much as possible.
</p><p>
</p><p>General Safety Rules &amp;Procedures:
</p><p>Keep food temperatures below 40 (5C) and above 140 (60C).
</p><p>Understand and apply the principles of safe, sanitary food handling.
</p><p>(Key personnel should take the SERVE-SAFE course!)
</p><p>Do not work when you have a cold.
