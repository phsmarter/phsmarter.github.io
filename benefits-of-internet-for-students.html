                                            'Ligtas na balik-paaralan': Groups, education stakeholders call for safe school reopening
Published September 7, 2021
by Gabriela Baron
Various groups and education stakeholders on Tuesday, Sept. 7, issued a five-point demand to the national government as another school year starts under the imposition of distance learning.
“The President has rejected at least three times the proposals to reopen schools in areas considered to be at low-risk for a COVID-19 outbreak, without providing a clear roadmap on how and when it plans to do so,” the groups said in a statement.
The groups hit Duterte’s failure to provide the requisites for the safe delivery of accessible quality of education amid the pandemic.
“Millions of youth and education workers will be again subjected to under-supported and onerous distance learning amidst the ranging pandemic and worsening economic crisis,” they added.
According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Philippines is one of the five countries in the world that have not started in-person classes since the pandemic began.
School closures have affected over 27 million students.
The Duterte administration is urged to roll out a clear plan for the immediate safe conduct of limited and voluntary in-classroom learning in low-risk areas; provide the needed teaching and learning resources for distance learning; ensure the provision of health protection and payment of just benefits to education workers; allocate higher budget to education in 2022; and implement genuine academic ease.
The groups also urged to ramp up the vaccination of teacher and education support personnel and grant P1,500 monthly Internet allowance to teachers and Internet subsidy to learners in need.
The unity statement is signed by the National Union of Students of the Philippines, NNARA-Youth, Alliance of Concerned Teachers, Coalition for People’s Right to Health, Amihan, Gabriela-Marikina, Salinlahi, Kabataan, and Kabataan Partylist.

The warning labels on cigarette cartons tell the story: smoking can cause lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, premature birth and injury to babies born to smokers. Yet, despite the dangers, cigarettes are readily available in convenience stores, gas stations, and liquor stores 2. Cigarettes are deadly; the risks are real; the benefits are nonexistent. The only way to stop the danger is to stop the sale of cigarettes altogether. 3. A new generation is emerging who have never known life without the internet or social media. How will their consumer behavior and spending patterns shape businesses in the future? And as more Gen Zs enter the workforce, how will their new ideas and approaches alter the workplace?4. Many students are scrambling-much like their professors to adopt to this virtual learning environment we have been abruptly tossed into. For some, this may be an easy, or perhaps even welcome, transition. That is dependent on several factors. The first factor, which cannot be understated, is the home-life of students who have transitioned back to their familial residences. Many students have chaotic homes, filled with family members who have been forced to work or attend school remotely. This puts a strain on internet capabilities as well, which further dampens the educational potential of these online courses.5. With scientists still trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and any possible cure still several months away from mass production, the consequences of reopening classes in the country's crowded need careful consideration. Technology allows remote learning, and efforts must be ramped up to make this universally accessible. With public health threat expected to persist for months, alternative learning modes must be promoted.​</a>

                            8. 'Ligtas na balik-paaralan': Groups, education stakeholders call for safe school reopening
Published September 7, 2021
by Gabriela Baron
Various groups and education stakeholders on Tuesday, Sept. 7, issued a five-point demand to the national government as another school year starts under the imposition of distance learning.
“The President has rejected at least three times the proposals to reopen schools in areas considered to be at low-risk for a COVID-19 outbreak, without providing a clear roadmap on how and when it plans to do so,” the groups said in a statement.
The groups hit Duterte’s failure to provide the requisites for the safe delivery of accessible quality of education amid the pandemic.
“Millions of youth and education workers will be again subjected to under-supported and onerous distance learning amidst the ranging pandemic and worsening economic crisis,” they added.
According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Philippines is one of the five countries in the world that have not started in-person classes since the pandemic began.
School closures have affected over 27 million students.
The Duterte administration is urged to roll out a clear plan for the immediate safe conduct of limited and voluntary in-classroom learning in low-risk areas; provide the needed teaching and learning resources for distance learning; ensure the provision of health protection and payment of just benefits to education workers; allocate higher budget to education in 2022; and implement genuine academic ease.
The groups also urged to ramp up the vaccination of teacher and education support personnel and grant P1,500 monthly Internet allowance to teachers and Internet subsidy to learners in need.
The unity statement is signed by the National Union of Students of the Philippines, NNARA-Youth, Alliance of Concerned Teachers, Coalition for People’s Right to Health, Amihan, Gabriela-Marikina, Salinlahi, Kabataan, and Kabataan Partylist.

                            18.  Activity 1 Directions: Write YES on the space provided if the paragraphs are examples of an editorial introduction and NO if not. 1. The warning labels on cigarette cartons tell the story: smoking can cause lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, premature birth and injury to babies born to smokers. Yet, despite the dangers, cigarettes are readily available in convenience stores, gas stations, and liquor stores 2. Cigarettes are deadly; the risks are real; the benefits are nonexistent. The only way to stop the danger is to stop the sale of cigarettes altogether. 3. A new generation is emerging who have never known life without the internet or social media. How will their consumer behavior and spending patterns shape businesses in the future? And as more Gen Zs enter the workforce, how will their new ideas and approaches alter the workplace?4. Many students are scrambling-much like their professors to adopt to this virtual learning environment we have been abruptly tossed into. For some, this may be an easy, or perhaps even welcome, transition. That is dependent on several factors. The first factor, which cannot be understated, is the home-life of students who have transitioned back to their familial residences. Many students have chaotic homes, filled with family members who have been forced to work or attend school remotely. This puts a strain on internet capabilities as well, which further dampens the educational potential of these online courses.5. With scientists still trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and any possible cure still several months away from mass production, the consequences of reopening classes in the country's crowded need careful consideration. Technology allows remote learning, and efforts must be ramped up to make this universally accessible. With public health threat expected to persist for months, alternative learning modes must be promoted.​</h2><br />
