However, the concept also applies to buying groceries, medical supplies ... While panic buying will empty shelves in stores and thereby creating the impression of shortages, there are large quantities sitting in warehouses waiting to be shipped to those stores.Source: https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/p/2020/03/19/covid-19-critiquing-newsreleases-whats-missing--teachable-opportunitiesWhat type of work is being critiqued?A.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</a>

                                            Let's ApplyRead an example of an argumentative essay below. Then answer the activity thatfollow by completing the outline with necessary information on a separate sheet ofpaper.Every school day, more than seven thousand students become dropouts. Annually. that adds up to about 1.3 million students who will not graduate from high school with their peers as scheduled. Students should never drop out of high school because they will be far more likely to spend their lives periodically unemployed, on government assistance, or cycling in and out of the prison system.One reason that someone should not drop out of high school is that they are far more likely to struggle keeping a good job. Most places would prefer to hire a worker that as completed high school. This is important because even a person is capable of doing the job, the employer might overlook them simply because they are a quitter. Even if the dropout gets a job, others that are more educated are more likely to be promoted faster because they are more qualified. Therefore, a person that has dropped out will be forced to work at places that do not require much skill and thus, make less money. More specifically, high school dropouts earn 143 dollars less per13week than a worker with their diploma. This totals to nearly a 7,500 dollars difference each year, and that is if the dropout can keep their job. All in all, it is quite clear that nothing good will come from students dropping out of high school. Struggling to keep a job, relying on government assistance, and being in and out of prison are very realistic possibilities for the students who do not graduate. Do not be part of the 7,000-refuse to quit. When school gets tough, seek the help needed in order to graduate on time and help make the future brighter.1.IntroductionA. Hook: B. Thesis Statement:2.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</h2><br />

Then answer the activity thatfollow by completing the outline with necessary information on a separate sheet ofpaper.Every school day, more than seven thousand students become dropouts. Annually. that adds up to about 1.3 million students who will not graduate from high school with their peers as scheduled. Students should never drop out of high school because they will be far more likely to spend their lives periodically unemployed, on government assistance, or cycling in and out of the prison system.One reason that someone should not drop out of high school is that they are far more likely to struggle keeping a good job. Most places would prefer to hire a worker that as completed high school. This is important because even a person is capable of doing the job, the employer might overlook them simply because they are a quitter. Even if the dropout gets a job, others that are more educated are more likely to be promoted faster because they are more qualified. Therefore, a person that has dropped out will be forced to work at places that do not require much skill and thus, make less money. More specifically, high school dropouts earn 143 dollars less per13week than a worker with their diploma. This totals to nearly a 7,500 dollars difference each year, and that is if the dropout can keep their job. All in all, it is quite clear that nothing good will come from students dropping out of high school. Struggling to keep a job, relying on government assistance, and being in and out of prison are very realistic possibilities for the students who do not graduate. Do not be part of the 7,000-refuse to quit. When school gets tough, seek the help needed in order to graduate on time and help make the future brighter.1.IntroductionA. Hook: B. Thesis Statement:2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Throughout the Taximan's Story, we see a glimpse into the life of a taxi driver who earns a living by driving tourists and social escorts around. He shares his disapproval of the younger generation's behavior, often lying to their parents and engaging in activities lacking moral values. However, the story is a reminder to respect and cherish the sacrifices made by our parents in providing for us. We should enjoy our youth, but not at the expense of disrespecting those who love and care for us. Ultimately, the Taximan's Story is a lesson in valuing and appreciating the hard work put in by those who support us.</p><br />
