                            4. Write a short essay about the importance of developing entrepreneurial skills to yourself, your family, and your community</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The importance of the development of entrepreneurial skills by every graduate cannot be over-emphasized because gone are the days when jobs were available everywhere both in the private and public sector of the economy and employers go about looking for potential employees to employ. Indeed, in the past, it is the employers that go round universities in this country to hunt for potential employees. Then there were fewer universities and low university enrollment. But today, things have changed and very drastically too such that many graduates are now sellers of recharge cards and some work as bus conductors. What an economic tragedy and waste! The question of choice of job or employer is gradually being eroded each year. Many graduates are desperate to get any job to keep body and soul going. Indeed there is a paradigm shift in the labor market now. Even the professional disciplines are now fast getting into that problem of unemployment.</p><p></p><p>Employment prospects for the youths are changing with a lot of increasing competition; the openings are equally limited. Also, employment in the public sector is also decreasing and job prospects are diminishing by the day. Added to this ugly situation are the increasing trend of job outsourcing, casualization of labor in the oil and gas industry and the increasing phenomenon of rightsizing of labor among big firms and corporations in the country. As a side effect, the figure of tertiary graduates who have not been able to secure the first employment since graduation for upward of five years is on the increase and even those with professional qualifications like MBA, ICAN, COREN, Medicine and Pharmacy are not spared from the ugly phenomenon. Others are paid peanuts if they are lucky to secure paid job. Some now fall back on their lower qualifications like WASC and OND to secure menial jobs.</p><p></p><p>Entrepreneurship could satisfy status and social needs and leads to self-satisfaction and actualization.It can also meet the financial needs for the entrepreneurs and their families. In fact, entrepreneurship is a satisfying process even though it can be risky and may even lead to loss of wealth at times (Fry, 1992). Society-wise, entrepreneurship has made substantial impacts throughout history because of numerous inventions, massive job creations made through small and medium scale enterprises (SMES) in both developed and developing countries.</p><br />

                            5. Write an essay on: How will you use and improve your skills to address the community needs​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Community managers are the heart of most brand communities. They're expected to facilitate increased sales, customer retention, and overall business growth, whilst also working to cultivate and enhance relationships with consumers.</p><p></p><p> Community management skills are wide ranging: getting to know real customers and using that information to enhance brand personas and target new prospects are just the tip of the ice berg.</p><p></p><p>So, what does it take to be a good community manager? The skillset is complex and requires someone with not only strong communication and strategy skills, but technical and analytical abilities too.</p><p></p><p>One of the most crucial community management skills to have is a strong ability to communicate. Being able to understand the ebb and flow of a conversation and knowing the right time to inject some humor, or to moderate will make or break a person in this role. You need more than proper grammar; you need to know how to effectively represent your brand and your customers in any situation.</p><p></p><p>Customer-facing roles can be tough. There are plenty of opportunities for things to go wrong, and sometimes, unfortunately, that’s exactly what happens. When you become a community manager, you must learn the art of keeping calm in the face of criticism and pressure.</p><p></p><p>Whether you’re having technical issues or assisting an unruly customer, you should remain level-headed and respectful. If you need to take a few minutes to collect your thoughts and determine the next steps – do it. Remember: You’re not just representing yourself, you’re representing your company!</p><p></p><p>Organization and planning are critical to a community manager’s success. Everything from the content you post to the contests you run should be organized in a detailed calendar. There are a number of websites that can help you plot out your content schedule, but a simple excel sheet should do the trick.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Of course, you can’t plan for everything, but having a detailed calendar will keep you on track to achieve your goals. From product releases to seasonal posts, you should always know what’s coming down the content pipeline. Create a daily, weekly, and monthly checklist to make sure you’re staying on the right track.</p><p></p><p>Traditional ROI metrics can be tracked through user clicks and conversions. While you may not be able to accurately determine how many community members made purchases based on your content, you can gain knowledge about your customer’s habits, build brand awareness, and improve overall experience by monitoring social metrics.</p><p></p><p>What content is your community receptive to? What content falls flat? How are users interacting on a highly engaged forum? How can you leverage this information to build your brand? These are key things to ask yourself in order to improve.</p><p></p><p>There is no place for complacency in community management. Just because you ran a successful contest in August, doesn’t mean you can slack off in September. Dedication, passion, and consistent performance are critical to success. If you don’t get excited about the community you manage, why would the users?</p><p></p><p>This job isn’t your typical 9 to 5. Users are interacting on community forums at all hours of the day. A great community manager should be available during the off-hours, especially if your brand has a big product release or announcement that will increase user interest. This isn’t a problem for the tech savvy who can pull out their phone and engage with the community while on the go.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>ESSAY "HOW COMMUNICATION SKILLS CAN HELP US IN LIFE"</strong></p><p><strong>- AT SCHOOL</strong></p><p><strong>- AT WORK</strong></p><p><strong>- IN RELATIONSHIP AND </strong></p><p><strong>- IN SOCIAL INTERACTION</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Communication skills are very important to be applied in various lines of life, both at school, at work, in relationships and in social interactions. </strong>For the sake of realizing learning objectives, communication in learning can simply be interpreted as a process of exchanging ideas and ideas between teachers and students. Therefore, communication in learning must be effective so that it can improve achievement and teaching and learning outcomes. Likewise in the workplace, good communication is important in the workplace because little work is an act in itself. It takes communication to work in a team, and even people working alone must report to their superiors. If you run a business, you must tell your employees what is expected of them. Poor communication leads to errors, failures, and sometimes lawsuits. Effective communication helps prevent these mistakes.</p><p></p><p><strong>No less important is communication in special relationships. </strong>One of the main keys in maintaining the rhythm of a good and healthy relationship is communication. Communication is important to create a sense of belonging and build a feeling of mutual trust in your partner so as not to make the relationship unhealthy and even messy. Good communication is very necessary in a good relationship, it's a love relationship. Many people do not communicate effectively because they are afraid of a response from their partner or because their partner never respects their feelings. Though good communication is a key element in maintaining the stability of a relationship. According to one study conducted in 2018 we can know that conflicts that occur whether they are still in thought or have been formed through physical behavior, then this can create or cause psychological violence either from one party or both parties. In a wider and crucial scope, namely in social interaction. We can find examples of social interaction in everyday life.</p><p></p><p>Social interaction is something that we cannot avoid every day. <strong>Humans are social creatures who interact with other individuals every day.</strong> This social interaction can occur between individuals or groups. The purpose of this reciprocal relationship is to establish friendships, discussions, and collaborations that are applied in social life. One of the characteristics of social interaction is the number of interaction actors more than one or more people. Social interaction occurs when there is communication between social actors using symbols. There are three types of social interactions that exist in our daily lives, namely individual social interaction with individuals, individual social interactions with groups, and group social interactions with groups.</p><p></p><p><strong>Social communication between individuals and individuals</strong>, namely greeting each other and asking how they are passing by neighbors, inviting them to play with their brothers or sisters at home. Another example is a student asking the teacher about the subject matter that has not been understood, father and mother talking together after a long day at work, buyers and traders haggling in the market. Second, the <strong>social communication of individuals with groups</strong>. For example, a resource person gives an explanation at a seminar, a salesperson conducts a cooking demonstration at the social gathering for the neighborhood women, the principal is talking to the students during the ceremony, a teacher is teaching his students in class. Finally, <strong>group communication with the group</strong>. For example, students and college students who carry out real work college work programs provide direction to villagers and inter-class sports competitions.</p><p></p><p>See more about <strong>The Harm Of Interacting With Strangers Online </strong>here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2222082</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> The 21st century learning skills are often called the 4 C's: critical thinking, creative thinking, communicating, and collaborating. These skills help students learn, and so they are vital to success in school and beyond. Creativity teaches students to think in a way that's unique to them. Collaboration teaches students that groups can create something bigger and better than you can on your own. Communication teaches students how to efficiently convey ideas. Combined, the four C's empower students to become one-person think tanks. The 4Cs listed are communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity. All four of these items are essential inside the 21st Century classroom. Without effective communication, there's no way to get anything done inside the classroom or anywhere, which is why this is an essential 21st Century skill. These 21st-century skills are more important to students now than ever before. They not only provide a framework for successful learning in the classroom, but ensure students can thrive in a world where change is constant and learning never stops. And they are also tremendously important for our nation's well being. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope nakatulong</p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>Our world faces formidable challenges that demand the next generation of college graduates be capable leaders with expansive understandings of public life, honed skills of critical thinking, and the abilities to collaborate with diverse groups to solve problems and create change. </p><p></p><p>Teaching students to apply knowledge and skills to benefit others or serve the public good is one exceptionally high impact method to foster these capabilities across the disciplines (1). Service learning, as it is typically called, is pedagogy that weds learning goals and community needs in scholarly service projects that, when done well, enhance both student learning and community development. Or, according to Janet Eyler, it is “a form of experiential education where learning occurs through a cycle of action and reflection as students…seek to achieve real objectives for the community and deeper understanding and skills for themselves” (2, also 3).</p><p>The benefits of community engagement are well documented in the scholarship on teaching and learning for students, faculty, and community partners. Students achieve greater intellectual development in the form of deeper knowledge of the discipline, problem-solving capacities, critical thinking, and abilities to understand complexity and ambiguity, but also greater personal and social growth through enhanced personal efficacy, moral reasoning, interpersonal skills, intercultural competencies, commitments to social service, and even career development. Faculty also find greater satisfaction with student learning, new research opportunities and collaborations, not to mention stronger ties to their community. Of course, when done well community engagement also benefits community partners with improved capacities to research and resolve social problems, and more supportive campus-community relations.  Together, these outcomes support a more dynamic public scholarship and civic engagement for higher education; one that, not only supports student development, but also the more collaborative civic learning and problem solving necessary to improve our collective capacities for democracy and well-being (3).</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            24. Why is it important for an individual to improve his or her communication skills? write at least 5 sentences essay</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Listening</p><p>To become a good communicator, it is important to be a good listener. It is important to practice active listening – pay close attention to what others are saying and clarify ambiguities by rephrasing their questions for greater understanding.</p><p></p><p>2. Conciseness</p><p>Convey your message in as few words as possible. Do not use filler words and get straight to the point. Rambling will cause the listener to tune out or be unsure of what you are talking about. Avoid speaking excessively and do not use words that may confuse the audience.</p><p></p><p>3. Body language</p><p>It is important to practice good body language, use eye contact, utilize hand gestures, and watch the tone of the voice when communicating with others. A relaxed body stance with a friendly tone will aid in making you look approachable to others.</p><p></p><p>Eye contact is important in communication – look the person in the eye to indicate that you are focused on the conversation. But make sure to not stare at the person as it can make him or her uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>4. Confidence</p><p>Be confident in what you say and in your communication interactions with others. Being confident can be as easy as maintaining eye contact, maintaining a relaxed body stance, and talking with concision. Try not to make statements sound like questions and avoid trying to sound aggressive or demeaning.</p><p></p><p>5. Open-mindedness</p><p>In situations where you disagree with what someone else has to say, whether it be with an employer, a co-worker, or a friend, it is important to sympathize with their point of view rather than simply try to get your message across. Respect the opinion of others and never resort to demeaning those who do not agree with you.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The importance of the development of entrepreneurial skills by every graduate cannot be over-emphasized because gone are the days when jobs were available everywhere both in the private and public sector of the economy and employers go about looking for potential employees to employ. Indeed, in the past, it is the employers that go round universities in this country to hunt for potential employees. Then there were fewer universities and low university enrollment. But today, things have changed and very drastically too such that many graduates are now sellers of recharge cards and some work as bus conductors. What an economic tragedy and waste! The question of choice of job or employer is gradually being eroded each year. Many graduates are desperate to get any job to keep body and soul going. Indeed there is a paradigm shift in the labor market now. Even the professional disciplines are now fast getting into that problem of unemployment.</p><p></p><br />
