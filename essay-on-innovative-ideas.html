                        <strong>Answer:The meaning of “liberating education through innovation” is “freeing education through transformation” in simpler terms.  
</strong><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Here are some thoughts that can trigger your thoughts to come out too to help you out in your essay about “liberating education through innovation”.  
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Education has long been part of this world. Currently, our world is already experiencing continuous transformations through technology and globalization. Embracing innovation in education system will enable education to reach greater heights that will enable students and teachers to improve for the better. It is only through openness to good changes will education be able to cope up with the swift improvements of our world.  
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Current examples of innovations in education is the setting up of online classes in the internet. Before, attending school is only confined in the four walls of the classroom. Now, anyone can already learn online through online classes, without the need to go to school physically. This shows that education was able to cope up and maximize the wide usage of the internet anywhere in the world. Moreover, this milestone is a true manifestation that education is truly for anyone, regardless where they are or how they learn.  
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Another example of the role of innovation in education is the usage of Youtube materials during class discussions. Before, teachers only use the blackboard, Manila paper or overhead projector to discuss a topic more clearly. Now, teachers and professors already use education Youtube videos to catch the attention of their students, and let the students understand the topics more.  </strong></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p>Essay about your innovation experiences<p><strong>The biggest secret of innovation is that anyone can do it. The reason is simple: It’s just not that hard. Look up the word “innovate” in any dictionary and see what it actually means, instead of what you think it means. You’ll find something like this: To innovate is “to introduce something new.” That’s it. It doesn’t say you need to be a creative genius, a workaholic, or even have on clean underwear. It’s just three little words: introduce something new. And I promise that by the end of this essay, you’ll have all the secrets needed to do it yourself.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The biggest secret of innovation is that anyone can do it.

This turns out to be the third most ridiculous assumption in the history of mankind (you’ll have to figure out the other two for yourself). Here’s proof: Name any great innovator, and I guarantee they borrowed and reused ideas from the past to make whatever it is they are famous for.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>Hope </strong><strong>this</strong><strong> help</strong><strong> you</strong></p><br />

</p><p>
</p><p>This year's theme for the Annual National Congress spearheaded by the Philippines Librarians Association, Inc. in partnership with the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, is quite interesting at hand.
</p><p>
</p><p>The three words involved in the theme, even though are common in the English language are quite connected with each other in terms of its objectivity for our libraries.
</p><p>
</p><p>Inclusive or inclusivity stands for, no man is left alone. Libraries are encouraged to create a more diverse and equal environment through its resources and what else they can add into this.
</p><p>
</p><p>Innovative or innovation on the other hand, gives our libraries the encouragement to not pause into hard bound books but try to keep up with the latest changes and innovations in our technology to make things more interesting to our audience.
</p><p>
</p><p>Lastly, interconnected is on the part where we all are connected somehow. Be it in terms of our interest, culture or history. Especially with us, Filipinos, we always have the sense of family bond even with people we've just met or people who's not blood-related to us.
</p><p>
</p><p>This year's theme, if passed on properly and executed in the right terms will definitely be a huge thing for our libraries and us as well.
