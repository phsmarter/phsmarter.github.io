                                            The Two Brothers
Leo Tolstoy
Two brothers set out on a joumey together. At noon they lay out on a forest to rest. When they woke up they say
a stone lying next to them. There was something written on the stone, and they tried to make out what it was.
"Whoever finds this stone, let him go straight to the forest at sunrise. In the forest, a river will appear, let him swim
across the river to the other side. There he will see a she-bear and her cubs. Let him take the cubs from her and run
up the mountain with them, without looking back. On the top of the mountain, he will see a house, and in that house
he will find happiness."
When they had read what was written on the stone, the younger brother said: "Let us go together. We can swim
across the river, carry off the bear cubs, take them to the house on the mountain, and together they find happiness."
1 am not going into the forest after bear cubs," said the elder brother, "and I advise you not to go. In the first
place, no one can know whether what is written on this stone is the truth -perhaps it was written in jest... In the
second place, even if what is written here is the truth-suppose we go into the forest and night comes, and we cannot
find the river. We shall be lost. And if we do find the river, how are we going to swim across it? In the third place, even
if we swim across the river, do you think it is an easy thing to take her cubs away from a she-bear? She will seize us,
and instead of finding happiness, we shall perish and all for nothing. And, most of all, the stone does not tell us what
kind of happiness we should find in that house. It may be that the happiness awalting us there is not at all the sort of
happiness we would want."
The younger brother replied, "In my opinion, you are wrong. What is written on the stone could not have been
put there without reason. And it is all perfectly clear. In the first place, no harm will come to us if we try. In the second
place, if we do not go, someone else will read the inscription on the stone and find happiness, and we shall have lost
it all. In the third place, if you do not make an effort and try hard, nothing in the world will succeed. In the fourth place,
I should not want it thought that I was afraid of anything."
And so, the younger brother followed all the instructions on the stone. When he reached the top of the mountain
the people came out to take him to the city, where they made him their king. He ruled for five years, but in the sixth
year, another king waged war against him. The city was conquered, and he was driven out.
Again, the younger brother became a wandered, and he arrived one day at the house of the elder brother. The
brother was living in a village and had grown neither rich nor poor. The two brothers rejoiced at seeing each other, and
at once began telling of all that happened to them.
"You see," said the elder brother, "I was right. Here I have lived quietly and well, whole you, though you may have
been a king, have seen a great deal of trouble."
1 do not regret having gone into the forest and up the mountain," replied the younger brother. "I may have nothing
now, but I shall always have 
something to remember, while you have no memories at all."

                        Paragraph 1 (Introduction):<br /><br />Leo Tolstoy's "The Two Brothers" is a short story about two brothers who inherit their father's farm and learn to deal with their conflicting personalities and desires. The story is set in the countryside of Russia during the 19th century and explores themes of family, responsibility, and the pursuit of happiness.<br /><br />Paragraph 2 (Body):<br /><br />The main characters in "The Two Brothers" are not related to me, but I found their personalities relatable in many ways. While one brother is driven by a desire for success and wealth, the other is content with a simple life. This dichotomy reminded me of my own experiences with family and friends who have different priorities and values.<br />The setting of the story is effective in creating a vivid picture of life in rural Russia during the 19th century. Tolstoy's descriptions of the countryside and the changing seasons help to bring the story to life. For example, when describing the winter landscape, Tolstoy writes: "The white, untrodden snow stretched over the whole valley, reflecting the rays of the sun, and its cold, sparkling crystals seemed to penetrate the very soul."<br />The plot of "The Two Brothers" is interesting, but it may not be to everyone's taste. The story is slow-paced and focuses on the inner lives of the characters, rather than action or suspense. However, this allows for a deeper exploration of the themes of family, responsibility, and happiness. The climax of the story is unexpected and provides a satisfying conclusion.<br />The conflict in "The Two Brothers" is clear and realistic, as it deals with the struggle between two brothers who have different ideas about how to run their farm. This conflict is something that many people can relate to, as it is common for family members to have different goals and desires.<br />The theme of "The Two Brothers" is that happiness cannot be found through wealth and material possessions alone. This is demonstrated through the contrast between the two brothers, one of whom values success and wealth, while the other is content with a simple life. The story suggests that true happiness comes from living a fulfilling life that is in line with one's values and priorities.<br />Paragraph 3 (Conclusion):<br /><br />Overall, "The Two Brothers" is a well-written and thought-provoking story that explores important themes related to family, responsibility, and happiness. While it may not be to everyone's taste, the slow pace and emphasis on character development allow for a deeper exploration of these themes. The story has enduring value, as it provides a timeless lesson about the importance of living a fulfilling life that is true to one's values.<br />

                            6. The Two Brothers
Leo Tolstoy
Two brothers set out on a joumey together. At noon they lay out on a forest to rest. When they woke up they say
a stone lying next to them. There was something written on the stone, and they tried to make out what it was.
"Whoever finds this stone, let him go straight to the forest at sunrise. In the forest, a river will appear, let him swim
across the river to the other side. There he will see a she-bear and her cubs. Let him take the cubs from her and run
up the mountain with them, without looking back. On the top of the mountain, he will see a house, and in that house
he will find happiness."
When they had read what was written on the stone, the younger brother said: "Let us go together. We can swim
across the river, carry off the bear cubs, take them to the house on the mountain, and together they find happiness."
1 am not going into the forest after bear cubs," said the elder brother, "and I advise you not to go. In the first
place, no one can know whether what is written on this stone is the truth -perhaps it was written in jest... In the
second place, even if what is written here is the truth-suppose we go into the forest and night comes, and we cannot
find the river. We shall be lost. And if we do find the river, how are we going to swim across it? In the third place, even
if we swim across the river, do you think it is an easy thing to take her cubs away from a she-bear? She will seize us,
and instead of finding happiness, we shall perish and all for nothing. And, most of all, the stone does not tell us what
kind of happiness we should find in that house. It may be that the happiness awalting us there is not at all the sort of
happiness we would want."
The younger brother replied, "In my opinion, you are wrong. What is written on the stone could not have been
put there without reason. And it is all perfectly clear. In the first place, no harm will come to us if we try. In the second
place, if we do not go, someone else will read the inscription on the stone and find happiness, and we shall have lost
it all. In the third place, if you do not make an effort and try hard, nothing in the world will succeed. In the fourth place,
I should not want it thought that I was afraid of anything."
And so, the younger brother followed all the instructions on the stone. When he reached the top of the mountain
the people came out to take him to the city, where they made him their king. He ruled for five years, but in the sixth
year, another king waged war against him. The city was conquered, and he was driven out.
Again, the younger brother became a wandered, and he arrived one day at the house of the elder brother. The
brother was living in a village and had grown neither rich nor poor. The two brothers rejoiced at seeing each other, and
at once began telling of all that happened to them.
"You see," said the elder brother, "I was right. Here I have lived quietly and well, whole you, though you may have
been a king, have seen a great deal of trouble."
1 do not regret having gone into the forest and up the mountain," replied the younger brother. "I may have nothing
now, but I shall always have 
something to remember, while you have no memories at all."

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1.	Is the main character relatable to you? (Cite some qualities that make you similar or different.)  </strong></p><p>The main character, the older brother is not exactly relatable to myself, however, as he shows concern and love for his own brother, I am too. He takes care of his brother not only presently but for the future. Compared to myself, I am like this also since I do have siblings and I have to think about their well-being.<strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>2.	Is the setting effective or useful making you visualize the scenes? (Cite some lines that appeal to your senses)  </strong></p><p>Not exactly because the settings are from ancient years and it is quite hard to imagine the scenarios with words that are quite obsolete. However, the lines that goes like: So that night the younger brother went to his silo, gathered a large bundle of wheat, and climbed the hill that separated the two farms and over to his brother’s farm. Leaving the wheat in his brother’s silo, the younger brother returned home, feeling pleased with himself. So in this case, it is easy to reimagine it. <strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>3.	Is the plot interesting? (Cite aspects of it that make it good or dull.)
</strong></p><p>The plot provides a moral story about family however, as a story, it is rather tedious. There is no actual plot, the plot is not interesting there is no challenge. It isn’t even an interesting anecdote. <strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>4.	Is the conflict clear and realistic? (Indicate if it is something that people are likely to experience in life.)  </strong></p><p>Actually, the conflict is not qualified as a conflict. In fact, conflict does not seem to appear in the story. Also, it is not realistic. Though, the familial values are realistic, the plot and supposed conflict is not. <strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>5.	Is the theme relevant to human experiences? (Instead of an explanation, write the theme you inferred from each story.)
</strong></p><p>Yes, it is indeed relevant to human experiences. Families look out after each other. </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/9304380</p><br />
