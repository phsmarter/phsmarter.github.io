I decided to write an extended essay on how hip-hop works as a protest of the lower classes because I think the music is cool and really gets people dancing, inspiring those people who wouldn't normally think there's any point in being against anything to listen to the message. Being an enthusiastic hip-hop dancer myself, I really wanted to find out some more about this. ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: Chinese music, the art form of organized vocal and instrumental sounds that developed in China. It is one of the oldest and most highly developed of all known musical systems.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Chinese music history must be approached with a certain sense of awe. Indeed, any survey evokes the music of a varied, still-active civilization whose archaeological resources go back to 3000 BCE and whose own extensive written documents refer to countless forms of music not only in connection with folk festivals and religious events but also in the courts of hundreds of emperors and princes in dozens of provinces, dynasties, and periods. For all the richness of detail in Chinese sources, however, it is only for the last segment of Chinese music history—from the Song dynasty (960–1279 CE) to the present—that there is information about the actual music itself. Yet the historical, cultural, instrumental, and theoretical materials of earlier times are equally informative and fascinating. This mass of information can be organized into four large chronological units: (1) the formative period, from 3000 BCE through the 4th century CE, (2) the international period, from the 4th through the 9th century, (3) the national period, from the 9th through the 19th century, and (4) the “world music” period of the 20th and early 21st centuries.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
