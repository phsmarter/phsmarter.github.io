                        As principal of the San Pascual Elementary School in Ubay, Philippines, Maria Jeana Polinar is committed to creating an environment where every child learns to read. Classrooms at her school have cozy reading corners stocked with books. Students learn to read and write in Visayan, their mother tongue, as well as Filipino and English, and there are remedial reading and writing classes for students who need extra help.<br /><br />Polinar has even instituted a “zero non-reader” policy in her school to help teachers stay laser-focused on literacy instruction. “Reading is the foundation of learning,” she says. “There is no learning at all if a child can’t read and comprehend.”<br /><br />Polinar’s approach is a remarkable departure from how literacy used to be taught in the Philippines. For decades, teachers taught exclusively in Filipino and English—even though most children spoke one of the Philippines’ 19 major local languages at home. But this changed in 2012 when the Philippines government passed a wide-ranging education reform bill that, among many changes, adopted mother tongue instruction for kindergarten through grade 3.<br /><br />Implementing this new policy has been a huge undertaking for the Philippines Department of Education (DepEd)—but its partnership with EDC through the USAID-funded Basa Pilipinas program has delivered noteworthy results. Since 2013, Basa Pilipinas has improved literacy instruction for 1.8 million students in over 3,000 schools. DepEd is now preparing to roll out Basa’s approach and materials to every primary school in the country.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>During the early years of Spanish colonization, education was mostly religionoriented and controlled by the Roman Catholic Church. Spanish friars and missionaries educated the natives through religion with the aim of converting indigenous populations to the Catholic faith.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Primary instruction was made free and the teaching of Spanish was compulsory. This was ten years before Japan had a compulsory form of free modern public education and forty years before the American government started an English-based public school system in the Philippines.</strong></p><p></p><br />
