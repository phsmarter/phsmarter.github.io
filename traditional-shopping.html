                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The pandemic sparked a meteoric rise in online sales. As visits to physical stores were restricted, and many were running low on money, consumers went online to shop, causing online purchases to grow higher and higher. Consumers were generally mindful shoppers even before the pandemic.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Because of this, some shopping categories such as experiences were gradually downgraded on their priority lists, and COVID-19 accelerated things in this direction.The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lifestyles and motivations of many people, such that their purchasing behaviors also changed. The present study seeks to assess these changes. In achieving this goal, the study determined the impact of the pandemic on e-commerce across industries to identify the priorities of online consumers. It also identified the most important factors influencing online consumers’ shopping behavior based on a multi-stage survey as the pandemic spread. Based on the correlation analysis the presence of relationships between the studied factors and the complex indicator of activation of online consumer behavior was determined, the direction of their changes against the background of the pandemic was investigated.</p><p>This study aims to test the proposed approach to assessing the purchasing behavior of online consumers, which can contribute to the identification of trends and patterns of online shopping. Therefore, it can be a component of a comprehensive toolkit in the design of e-commerce strategy, used both at the state level and for individual companies.</p><p></p><br />
