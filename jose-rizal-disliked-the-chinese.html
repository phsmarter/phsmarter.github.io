                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>  </p><p>TO the Filipinos: In Noli Me Tangere I started to sketch the present state of our native land. But the effect which my effort produced made me realize that, before attempting to unroll before your eyes the other pictures which were to follow, it was necessary first to post you on the past. So only can you fairly judge the present and estimate how much progress has been made during the three centuries (of Spanish rule).</p><p></p><p>Dr. Jose Rizal with a group of Filipinos in Madrid, SpainPinterest</p><p>(Dr. Jose P. Rizal, center beside Marcelo H. Del Pilar and other Filipinos in Madrid, Spain, 1890.)</p><p>Like almost all of you, I was born and brought up in ignorance of our country's past and so, without knowledge or authority to speak of what I neither saw nor have studied, I deem it necessary to quote the testimony of an illustrious Spaniard who in the beginning of the new era controlled the destinies of the Philippines and had personal knowledge of our ancient nationality in its last days.</p><p></p><p>It is then the shade of our ancestor's civilization which the author will call before you... If the work serves to awaken in you a consciousness of our past, and to blot from your memory or to rectify what has been falsified or is calumny, then I shall not have labored in vain. With this preparation, slight though it be, we can all pass to the study of the future.</p><p></p><p>JOSE RIZAL, Europe, 1889.</p><p></p><br />

Gardens were built at imperial palaces for recreational purposes, namely the entertainment of the emperor and aristocrats. Focal points were often ponds and streams which attempted to reproduce miniature representations of famous landscapes. Japanese gardens, which are often designed to achieve maximum artistic effect in concise spaces — and to be seen from inside the house - emphasize the beauty of the static view. Chinese gardens typically occupy larger spaces and their designs emphasize movement through the garden to achieve multiple changes of view.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Hope it help!   </p><p>Pa brainliest po</p><p></p><br />
