                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Cyberbullying is a problem in societies that are advanced enough to have the technology to connect with other people online and is not easily fixable.  Cyberbullying can affect anyone but is most prominent in today’s youth.  If we can curve out this awful behavior early in their age, they are unlikely to continue down that path.   Unfortunately this is not an easy task.  This will require schools, and especially parents to be aware of the problem and act on it.  Eliminating cyberbullying will take a combined effort and wont be eliminated over night.  If the government is willing to accept that cyberbullying is a problem, laws can be put in place to help discourage this activity.  Even still, parents and schools should eliminate and stop this behavior now, then laws shouldn’t be necessary.  So schools and parents, be aware of what kids are doing on the internet and their phones, and act if they are doing something that they shouldn’t be.</p><br />

These are norms that depict certain standards of human behaviour and are protected by law.</p><p></p><p>Basic Human Rights</p><p></p><p>Human rights have been divided into two broad categories. These are the civil and political rights, and the social rights that also include the economic and cultural rights.  Here is a detailed look at the basic human rights given to every individual:</p><p></p><p>Right to Life</p><p></p><p>Every human being on earth has the right to live. Each individual has the right of not being killed by anyone and this right is protected by the law. However, this right is subject to issues such as death penalty, self defence, abortion, euthanasia and war.</p><p></p><p>Freedom of Speech</p><p></p><p>Every human being has the right to speak freely and voice his opinions in public. However, this right comes with certain limitations such as obscenity, slur and crime provocation.</p><p></p><p>Freedom of Thought, Conscience and Religion</p><p></p><p>Every state gives its citizens the right to think freely and form conscientious beliefs. An individual also has the right to follow any religion of his choice and change it as per his free will at any point in time.</p><p></p><p>Right to Fair Trial</p><p></p><p>Under this right every individual has the right to fair trial by impartial court, right to be heard within reasonable time, right to counsel, right to public hearing and right to interpretation.</p><p></p><p>Freedom from Torture</p><p></p><p>As per the international law, every individual has the right to freedom from torture. This has been prohibited since the mid 20th century.</p><p></p><p>Freedom of Movement</p><p></p><p>This means that every individual has the right to travel, live, work or study in any part of the state he resides in.</p><p></p><p>Freedom from Slavery</p><p></p><p>As per this right, slavery and slave trades are prohibited in every form. However, unfortunately these ill practices still go on illegally.</p><p></p><p>Violation of Human Rights</p><p></p><p>While every human being is entitled to human rights, these rights are often violated. The violation of these rights occurs when actions by state ignore, deny or abuse these rights.</p><p> </p><p>Human rights are the basic rights given to every individual. Known to be universal, these rights are guarded by the law.  However, unfortunately many a times these are violated by states, individuals or groups. It is almost inhuman to deprive a person of these basic rights. This is the reason why many organizations have been established to guard these rights.</p><br />

                        What are the roles of us as teachers to lessen the bullying? Not all of the students are in charge of adjusting when it comes to bullying. We, facilitators, also help to lessen the bullying cases as we discipline our pupils or students. Every teachers should be a role model to their students whom they are teaching. We are not just enhancing the comprehension, reading, writing, speaking, grammar, mathematical, or any acdemic- related skills that we should know and learn as we accelerate to upper levels of learning and dreaming, we also enhance and improve our students' values.<br /><br />As a teacher, these are the things we are intended to do. We do facilitate and monitor our classes and the students who belong in our classes we are monitoring. To lessen bullying, we always watch them wherever they go even though we're no there physically, we still manage to monitor by installing cameras around the school and within its premises. We also track the records of those who are bullying and being bullied, however, the numbers of those who are reporting to us that are being bullied are decreasing mainly because of threats by their bullies and ends up being bullied continuously and consequently. However, although not yet implemented or probably implemented by other schools, we can use social media for the bullied ones to share experience and gain justice and alleviate the bullies in their lives. They will be anonymously known so that no one will know their identity.<br /><br />Those are just some of the ways that are possible to achieve so that we can lessen and alleviate the percentage of bullying cases in our country. I do believe that the government will help us solve this problem. As a conclusion, we should help each other because if only one will work then the problem will not be solved the way it should be. We should practice and impose unity between the students and us, teachers, for us to be able to surpass this kind of grave situation.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Bullying is a pervasive issue that affects people of all ages and backgrounds. It can take many forms, including physical, verbal, and psychological abuse. The negative impact of bullying can be long-lasting and far-reaching, leading to a range of physical, emotional, and social problems for both victims and perpetrators. In this essay, we will explore the issues surrounding bullying, including its causes, effects, and potential solutions.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>Bullying can have a significant impact on the mental and emotional health of its victims. Those who experience bullying may suffer from anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. They may also have difficulty forming and maintaining healthy relationships with others, leading to feelings of isolation and loneliness. In extreme cases, bullying can even lead to self-harm or suicide.</p><p></p><p>While victims are clearly the primary targets of bullying, perpetrators can also suffer from a range of negative consequences. Those who engage in bullying behavior may struggle with feelings of guilt, shame, and regret, which can impact their self-esteem and sense of self-worth. They may also experience social ostracism and exclusion from their peers, as others may view them as aggressive or mean-spirited.</p><p></p><p>The causes of bullying are complex and multifaceted, but often stem from a range of personal, social, and environmental factors. These can include a lack of empathy, a desire for power and control, a learned behavior, and personal issues like low self-esteem. Addressing these underlying factors is key to developing effective solutions to the issue of bullying.</p><p></p><p>There are several potential solutions to the problem of bullying, including prevention programs, increased education and awareness, and stronger disciplinary measures for those who engage in bullying behavior. Prevention programs can help to create a culture of empathy, respect, and inclusivity, while education and awareness campaigns can help to reduce the stigma surrounding bullying and increase understanding of its impact. Stronger disciplinary measures can also serve as a deterrent for those who engage in bullying behavior, making it clear that this type of behavior will not be tolerated.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, bullying is a pervasive issue that has a far-reaching impact on individuals and communities. While the causes of bullying are complex and multifaceted, addressing the underlying factors is essential for developing effective solutions. By working together to create a culture of empathy, respect, and inclusivity, we can reduce the prevalence of bullying and ensure that all individuals are able to live healthy, happy, and fulfilling lives.   pa brainliest po sobrang tagal nito itype </p><br />

                        <br />     In school, students indeed experience bullying. May it be offensive words of one's physicality, misunderstanding of words or body language, misjudged, etc.<br /><br />    There are three things to consider in a situation of a bully and the victim. We must not forget also the bystander. In my opinion, it is the worst of them all. Why? Because a bystander in a situation like this doesn't care at all, a bystander doesn't care if you're bullied or not. A bystander who doesn't report to the principal's office or stand up for the victim. This type does apply to many, which makes us look like hypocrites. Why hypocrites? Because we're similar to what the bully is doing to the victim. As a matter of fact, not everyone is going to be the bully intentionally but not everyone is going to be the victim. Life is full of choices, you either choose what you're going to do because it's your life. What you do today will affect someone's life, may it be good or bad. What you don't do today will not affect you but you will lose something. <br /><br />    How to avoid being a bystander, a bully and a victim of bullying? First, you need to respect yourself first. Why? Because if you know how to respect yourself, you will also know how to respect others. Second, you need to accept people's corrections without lashing out. Lastly,  love God before loving yourself, because God is the whole definition of love. <br />

Bullying is linked to many negative outcomes including impacts on mental health, substance use, and suicide. It is important to talk to kids to determine whether bullying or something else is a concern. Kids who are bullied can experience negative physical, social, emotional, academic, and mental health issues. Kids who bully others can also engage in violent and other risky behaviors into adulthood. Media reports often link bullying with suicide. However, most youth who are bullied do not have thoughts of suicide or engage in suicidal behaviors. This risk can be increased further when these kids are not supported by parents, peers, and schools. Bullying can make an unsupportive situation worse.</p><p></p><p></p><p>hope it helps po :))</p><p></p><br />
