Source: 5-A U.S. ARMY AND MARINE CORPS BATTLEFIELD LOGISTICS by Alan Dennis.
Shortly after the Gulf War in 1991 (Desert Storm), the U.S. Department of Defense realized that there were significant problems in its battlefield logistics systems that provided supplies to the troops at the division level and below. During the Gulf War, it had proved difficult for army and marine units fighting together to share supplies back and forth because their logistics computer systems would not easily communicate. The goal of the new system was to combine the army and marine corps logistics systems into one system to enable units to share supplies under battlefield conditions.The army and marines built separate as-is process models of their existing logistics systems that had 165 processes for the army system and 76 processes for the marines. Both process models were developed over a 3-month time period and cost several million dollars to build, even though they were not intended to be comprehensive.I helped them develop a model for the new integrated battlefield logistics system that would be used by both services (i.e., the to-be model). The initial process model contained 1,500 processes and went down to level 6 DFDs in many places. It took 3,300 pages to print. They realized that this model was too large to be useful. The project leader decided that level 4 DFDs was as far as the model would go, with additional information contained in the process descriptions. This reduced the model to 375 processes (800 pages) and made it far more useful.
Questions
1. What are the advantages and disadvantages to setting a limit for the maximum depth for a DFD?
2. Is a level 4 DFD an appropriate limit? Why? Why not?</a>

                                            Formulating a Strategy: Following Apple TurnaroundThe firm's most important resources and capabilities are those which are durable, difficult to identify and understand, imperfect transferable, not easily replicated, and in which the firm possesses clear ownership. These are the company's 'most important assets' and need to be protected; and they play a pivotal role in the competitive strategy which the company pursues. The essence of strategy formulation, then, is to design a strategy that makes the most effective use of these core resources and capabilities. Consider, for example, the remarkable turnaround of Apple, the computer company behind the Macintosh computers, between 2000 to date. Fundamental was Steve Job's recognition that the company's sole durable, non-transferable, irreplicable asset was Apple image and the loyalty that accompanied that image. In virtually every other area of competitive performance-production cost, quality, product and process technology, and global market scope-Apple was greatly inferior to its other rivals, such as IBM. Apple's only opportunity for survival was to pursue a strategy founded upon Apple's image advantage, while simultaneously minimising Apple' disadvantages in other capabilities. Apple' new marketing strategy involved extending the appeal of the Apple image of individuality from its traditional customer group (tech savvy, graphic designers) to more a general, young professional types. Protection of the Apple name by means of tougher controls over dealers was matched by wider exploitation of the Apple name through entry in other industries such as the portable music business. Apple's share of the computer market went from 15% in 1985 to 4% in 2005 and lost around $700 million in only three months in 1997. However, thanks to the iPod and to the Apple's iTunes music stores, its shares grew 90% between 2001 up until today, i.e. from a mere $7/share. Apple is today the premier provider of MP3 players. Designing strategy around the most critically important resources and capabilities may imply that the firm limits its strategic scope to those activities where it possesses a clear competitive advantage. The principal capabilities of Apple, are in design and new products development; it lacked both the manufacturing capabilities to compete effectively in the world's computer market. Apple's turnaround from year 2000 followed it decision to specialise upon design and new product development. The ability of a firm's resources and capabilities to support a sustainable competitive advantage is essential to the time frame of a firm's strategic planning process. If a company's resources and capabilities lack durability or are easily transferred or replicated, then the company must either adopt a strategy of short-term harvesting or it must invest in developing new sources of competitive advantage.These considerations are critical for small technological start-ups where the speed of technological change may mean that innovations offer only temporary competitive advantage. The company must seek either to exploit its initial innovation before it is challenged by stronger, established rivals or other start-ups, or it must establish the technological capability for a continuing stream of innovations. The main issue for Apple is to make sure that it takes advantage of this window of opportunity. Because there are tougher competitors down the road and the more money it makes, the more companies will enter the market making harder for Apple to sustain this new found competitive advantage. In industries where competitive advantages based upon differentiation and innovation can be imitated (such as financial services, retailing, fashion clothing, toys), firms have a brief window of opportunity during which to exploit their advantage before imitators erode it away. Under such circumstances firms must be concerned not with sustaining the existing advantages, but with creating the flexibility and responsiveness that permits them to create new advantages at a faster rate than the old advantages are being eroded by competition                 Question What lessons can be learnt from Apple's Turnaround?​</a>

                                            Give your thought about this scenario: A teacher noticed a remarkable similarity among four programs turned in by different students. Apparently, three students in one classroom had copied a computer program from a student in another class, and then turned it in as their own work. The teacher and another faculty member had spent many hours investigating the situation and were able to conclusively prove the theft. The teacher told the students that he could not accept the programs, and gave the students an opportunity to make up the work within a limited time frame. Here is how the three students handled the situation : 1. Student A was embarrassed and apologized for violating the teacher's trust. He worked very hard during the time limit, sacrificing grades in other classes, but was able to turn in a better program than what was originally assigned for the copied program. 2. Student B said nothing, but did not have time to complete the program within the time limit due to pressures from other courses. He accepted the failing grade. He was having difficulty in the course anyway, so eventually dropped the class. 3. Student C did not apologize, but apparently found another program written by a student in a previous year for a different teacher, copied that program and turned it in as his own. The teachers were able to prove this second incident and called for a parent conference. Neither the parent nor the student apologize, but the parent blame the school, claiming that the teachers were at fault for having a system where students can take the "easy way out" by being able to copy work too easily.                                          Question :How should the teachers respond to the parental complaints of student C? if they fail the student, the student will likely be rejected from the Ivy League College and could lose scholarship opportunities. If they bow to the parent's pressure and allow a third try to make up the work, this student will have an affair advantage over student B? ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:1.1. Speed:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The speed of carrying out the given instruction logically and numerically is incomparable between a computer and human being. </strong></p><p>(Computer can perform and give instructions in less than a millionth of a second. The speed of the computer is specified in terms of Nano seconds and in Pico seconds, whereas human beings require most time to perform these functions.)</p><p>2. Accuracy:</p><p></p><p>Computer calculates very accurately and computer never does mistake although we often hear about the false results of computers. This may be due to the error in data entry or due to poorly designed program. Since, human beings do data entry and programming; hence, the error may make the results false. Otherwise, computer never does mistake. It works on the principle of “Garbage In, Garbage Out”. </p><p>Therefore, from speed point of view, computer’s functioning is very fast. </p><p><strong>Explanation:3. Versatility:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Previously, the computer was thought as only a calculating machine, but a computer cans also carryout logical operations.

Explain using one (1) of the “Theoretical Perspectives on Social Stratification”. Limit your answer to 8-10 sentences only.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Why</strong><strong> </strong><strong>do</strong><strong> </strong><strong>you</strong><strong> </strong><strong>think</strong><strong> </strong><strong>social</strong><strong> </strong><strong>stratification</strong><strong> </strong><strong>is</strong><strong> </strong><strong>universal</strong><strong>?</strong></p><p></p><p>Social stratification exists in every country. There is a rich, middle-class, and poor. This social stratification is due to an economical and political issue that is happening all around the world. We can see uprisings or protests happening around the globe, in Hong Kong, Indonesia, and also in our very own country. The proletariat and basic masses are resisting against the ruling class and bourgeoisie. </p><p></p><p><strong>What</strong><strong> </strong><strong>do</strong><strong> </strong><strong>you</strong><strong> </strong><strong>think</strong><strong> </strong><strong>technology</strong><strong> </strong><strong>plays</strong><strong> </strong><strong>in</strong><strong> </strong><strong>continuing</strong><strong> </strong><strong>social</strong><strong> </strong><strong>stratification</strong><strong> </strong><strong>in</strong><strong> </strong><strong>the</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Philippines</strong><strong>?</strong></p><p></p><p>As we go online, and scroll on social media sites, we see sometimes see people belittling other people for being unprivileged or poor. It is sad that these kinds of thing still happens up to this day. There are people who wants to feel empowered, and we've been conditioned to think that wealth and money means power. Because of that, some rich people think that they are above the others just because of their social and economical stand in life.</p><p></p><p><strong>Do</strong><strong> </strong><strong>you</strong><strong> </strong><strong>think</strong><strong> </strong><strong>having</strong><strong> </strong><strong>access</strong><strong> </strong><strong>to</strong><strong> </strong><strong>a</strong><strong> </strong><strong>computer</strong><strong> </strong><strong>gives</strong><strong> </strong><strong>a</strong><strong> </strong><strong>student</strong><strong> </strong><strong>an</strong><strong> </strong><strong>advantage</strong><strong> </strong><strong>over</strong><strong> </strong><strong>students</strong><strong> </strong><strong>who</strong><strong> </strong><strong>do</strong><strong> </strong><strong>not</strong><strong> </strong><strong>have</strong><strong> </strong><strong>access</strong><strong> </strong><strong>to</strong><strong> </strong><strong>a</strong><strong> </strong><strong>computer</strong><strong>?</strong></p><p></p><p>Absolutely yes. Some students are unprivileged and due to this, they are not able to reach their full potential in learning. Especially now during the time of alternative learning, there are schools that requires online learning despite many of their students having no computer or in a more worse situation, phone. Those who have computers or gadgets have it easier since they don't have to worry about it anymore, while those who doesn't have a computer or gadgets have to worry about not having a computer, and it hinders their learning or studies.</p><br />

Source: 5-A U.S. ARMY AND MARINE CORPS BATTLEFIELD LOGISTICS by Alan Dennis.
Shortly after the Gulf War in 1991 (Desert Storm), the U.S. Department of Defense realized that there were significant problems in its battlefield logistics systems that provided supplies to the troops at the division level and below. During the Gulf War, it had proved difficult for army and marine units fighting together to share supplies back and forth because their logistics computer systems would not easily communicate. The goal of the new system was to combine the army and marine corps logistics systems into one system to enable units to share supplies under battlefield conditions.The army and marines built separate as-is process models of their existing logistics systems that had 165 processes for the army system and 76 processes for the marines. Both process models were developed over a 3-month time period and cost several million dollars to build, even though they were not intended to be comprehensive.I helped them develop a model for the new integrated battlefield logistics system that would be used by both services (i.e., the to-be model). The initial process model contained 1,500 processes and went down to level 6 DFDs in many places. It took 3,300 pages to print. They realized that this model was too large to be useful. The project leader decided that level 4 DFDs was as far as the model would go, with additional information contained in the process descriptions. This reduced the model to 375 processes (800 pages) and made it far more useful.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>A discrete random variable is a variable that can only take on a finite or countable number of distinct values, while a continuous random variable can take on any value within a certain range.</p><p>In algebra, a variable is a symbol that represents an unknown value, while a random variable is a variable that takes on different values based on the outcome of a random process. Both variables can have values assigned to them, but random variables are based on probability.</p><p>The values of a random variable can be found by analyzing the probabilities of different outcomes in a random process and assigning values to those outcomes.</p><p>The steps in constructing a probability distribution include identifying the possible outcomes of a random process, assigning probabilities to each outcome, and calculating the expected value of the random variable.</p><p>a. Simple random sampling involves selecting individuals from a population randomly and independently, with an equal chance of being chosen. This technique can be used to select a sample of students from a school.</p><p>b. Systematic random sampling involves selecting individuals from a population based on a regular interval. This technique can be used to select a sample of products from a manufacturing line.</p><p>c. Stratified random sampling involves dividing a population into subgroups or strata and then selecting individuals from each stratum randomly. This technique can be used to select a sample of patients from a hospital based on different medical conditions.</p><p>d. Cluster sampling involves dividing a population into clusters or groups and then selecting one or more clusters randomly. This technique can be used to select a sample of schools in a district for a study.</p><p>e. Convenience sampling involves selecting individuals who are readily available or easily accessible. This technique can be used to select a sample of shoppers in a mall.</p><p>f. Purposive sampling involves selecting individuals based on specific criteria or characteristics. This technique can be used to select a sample of experts in a certain field.</p><p>Whether or not to use random sampling depends on the research question and the population being studied. If the population is large and diverse, random sampling can be useful to obtain a representative sample. A simple random sampling technique can be used to ensure that all individuals in the population have an equal chance of being selected.</p><p>It is more advantageous to compute the sample statistic because it is based on actual data collected from a sample of the population. The sample statistic can provide an estimate of the population parameter with a certain level of precision and confidence.</p><p>The advantage of choosing the population parameter is that it represents the true value of the characteristic being studied for the entire population. However, it can be difficult or impossible to obtain data for the entire population. The advantage of choosing the sample statistic is that it is based on actual data collected from a sample of the population, but it may not be a completely accurate representation of the population parameter.</p><br />

                            15. Formulating a Strategy: Following Apple TurnaroundThe firm's most important resources and capabilities are those which are durable, difficult to identify and understand, imperfect transferable, not easily replicated, and in which the firm possesses clear ownership. These are the company's 'most important assets' and need to be protected; and they play a pivotal role in the competitive strategy which the company pursues. The essence of strategy formulation, then, is to design a strategy that makes the most effective use of these core resources and capabilities. Consider, for example, the remarkable turnaround of Apple, the computer company behind the Macintosh computers, between 2000 to date. Fundamental was Steve Job's recognition that the company's sole durable, non-transferable, irreplicable asset was Apple image and the loyalty that accompanied that image. In virtually every other area of competitive performance-production cost, quality, product and process technology, and global market scope-Apple was greatly inferior to its other rivals, such as IBM. Apple's only opportunity for survival was to pursue a strategy founded upon Apple's image advantage, while simultaneously minimising Apple' disadvantages in other capabilities. Apple' new marketing strategy involved extending the appeal of the Apple image of individuality from its traditional customer group (tech savvy, graphic designers) to more a general, young professional types. Protection of the Apple name by means of tougher controls over dealers was matched by wider exploitation of the Apple name through entry in other industries such as the portable music business. Apple's share of the computer market went from 15% in 1985 to 4% in 2005 and lost around $700 million in only three months in 1997. However, thanks to the iPod and to the Apple's iTunes music stores, its shares grew 90% between 2001 up until today, i.e. from a mere $7/share. Apple is today the premier provider of MP3 players. Designing strategy around the most critically important resources and capabilities may imply that the firm limits its strategic scope to those activities where it possesses a clear competitive advantage. The principal capabilities of Apple, are in design and new products development; it lacked both the manufacturing capabilities to compete effectively in the world's computer market. Apple's turnaround from year 2000 followed it decision to specialise upon design and new product development. The ability of a firm's resources and capabilities to support a sustainable competitive advantage is essential to the time frame of a firm's strategic planning process. If a company's resources and capabilities lack durability or are easily transferred or replicated, then the company must either adopt a strategy of short-term harvesting or it must invest in developing new sources of competitive advantage.These considerations are critical for small technological start-ups where the speed of technological change may mean that innovations offer only temporary competitive advantage. The company must seek either to exploit its initial innovation before it is challenged by stronger, established rivals or other start-ups, or it must establish the technological capability for a continuing stream of innovations. The main issue for Apple is to make sure that it takes advantage of this window of opportunity. Because there are tougher competitors down the road and the more money it makes, the more companies will enter the market making harder for Apple to sustain this new found competitive advantage. In industries where competitive advantages based upon differentiation and innovation can be imitated (such as financial services, retailing, fashion clothing, toys), firms have a brief window of opportunity during which to exploit their advantage before imitators erode it away. Under such circumstances firms must be concerned not with sustaining the existing advantages, but with creating the flexibility and responsiveness that permits them to create new advantages at a faster rate than the old advantages are being eroded by competition                 Question What lessons can be learnt from Apple's Turnaround?​</h2><br />

                            23. Give your thought about this scenario: A teacher noticed a remarkable similarity among four programs turned in by different students. Apparently, three students in one classroom had copied a computer program from a student in another class, and then turned it in as their own work. The teacher and another faculty member had spent many hours investigating the situation and were able to conclusively prove the theft. The teacher told the students that he could not accept the programs, and gave the students an opportunity to make up the work within a limited time frame. Here is how the three students handled the situation : 1. Student A was embarrassed and apologized for violating the teacher's trust. He worked very hard during the time limit, sacrificing grades in other classes, but was able to turn in a better program than what was originally assigned for the copied program. 2. Student B said nothing, but did not have time to complete the program within the time limit due to pressures from other courses. He accepted the failing grade. He was having difficulty in the course anyway, so eventually dropped the class. 3. Student C did not apologize, but apparently found another program written by a student in a previous year for a different teacher, copied that program and turned it in as his own. The teachers were able to prove this second incident and called for a parent conference. Neither the parent nor the student apologize, but the parent blame the school, claiming that the teachers were at fault for having a system where students can take the "easy way out" by being able to copy work too easily.                                          Question :How should the teachers respond to the parental complaints of student C? if they fail the student, the student will likely be rejected from the Ivy League College and could lose scholarship opportunities. If they bow to the parent's pressure and allow a third try to make up the work, this student will have an affair advantage over student B? ​</h2><br />
                        <p>The student was being too arrogant, he didn't apply any effort to make a</p><p>program of his own even though he was given a second chance. It is not the school's fault that the student was able to copy another student's work. The parent might also be at fault for spoiling the child/student. I believe that the school should not tolerate such disgraceful behaviour from a student and should give him an appropriate punishment.</p><p></p><p>p.s. all of these are just my thoughts and opinions about the scenario. I might be considered too harsh by some people but this is my honest opinion. </p><br />
