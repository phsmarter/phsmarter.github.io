                                            History of the philippines
The history of the Philippines is known to have begun at least 709,000 years ago as suggested by the discovery of Pleistocene stone tools and butchered animal remains associated with hominin activity.[1] Homo luzonensis, a species of archaic humans, was present on the island of Luzon at least 67,000 years ago.[2][3] The earliest known modern human was from the Tabon Caves in Palawan dating about 47,000 years.[4] Negrito groups were the first inhabitants to settle in the prehistoric Philippines.[5] By around 3000 BC, seafaring Austronesians reached northern Philippines migrating southward from Taiwan.[6]
Scholars generally believe that these social groups eventually developed into various settlements or polities with varying degrees of economic specialization, social stratification, and political organization.[7] Some of these settlements (mostly those located on major river deltas) achieved such a scale of social complexity that some scholars believe they should be considered early states.[8] This includes the predecessors of modern-day population centers such as Maynila, Tondo, Pangasinan, Cebu, Panay, Bohol, Butuan, Cotabato, Lanao, and Sulu[9] as well as some polities, such as Ma-i, whose possible location is Mindoro or Laguna.[10]
These polities were either influenced by the Hindu-Buddhist[11] Indian religion, language, culture, literature and philosophy from India through many campaigns from India including the South-East Asia campaign of Rajendra Chola I,[12] Islam from Arabia, or were Sinified tributary states allied to China. These small maritime states flourished from the 1st millennium.[13][14] These kingdoms traded with what are now called China, India, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.[15] The remainder of the settlements were independent barangays allied with one of the larger states. These small states alternated from being part of or being influenced by larger Asian empires like the Ming Dynasty, Majapahit and Brunei or rebelling and waging war against them.
The first recorded visit by Europeans is Ferdinand Magellan's expedition who landed in Homonhon Island, now part of Guiuan, Eastern Samar on March 17, 1521. They lost a battle against the army of Lapulapu, chief of Mactan, where Magellan was killed.[16][17][18] Spanish colonialism began with the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi's expedition on February 13, 1565, from Mexico. He established the first permanent settlement in Cebu.[19] Much of the archipelago came under Spanish rule, creating the first unified political structure known as the Philippines. Spanish colonial rule saw the introduction of Christianity, the code of law, and the oldest modern university in Asia. The Philippines was ruled under the Mexico-based Viceroyalty of New Spain. After this, the colony was directly governed by Spain.
Spanish rule ended in 1898 with Spain's defeat in the Spanish–American War. The Philippines then became a territory of the United States. U.S. forces suppressed a revolution led by Emilio Aguinaldo. The United States established the Insular Government to rule the Philippines. In 1907, the elected Philippine Assembly was set up with popular elections. The U.S. promised independence in the Jones Act.[20] The Philippine Commonwealth was established in 1935, as a 10-year interim step prior to full independence. However, in 1942 during World War II, Japan occupied the Philippines. The U.S. military overpowered the Japanese in 1945. The Treaty of Manila in 1946 established the independent Philippine Republic.</a>

                                            introduction During the years of American colonialism and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, Manuel Luis Quezon was arguably the most eminent and well-known pre-war Filipino leader. He was unmatched in his involvement in Philippine affairs during the years from 1907 until his death in 1944. Over the course of a career spanning the duration of American colonial authority in the Philippines, Manuel Luis Quezon possessed unrivaled knowledge of territorial politics, which culminated in his service as the Commonwealth's first president. Quezon originally fought against the United States during its invasion of the islands in the early 1900s, but with to the sheer force of his personality and natural political skill, he rapidly propelled himself into a Resident Commissioner post. He was young and brilliant politician, possessed "an ability and persistence rare and creditable to any representative in any parliament in the world," according to a political rival. In private meetings with the President and influential committee chairs, he assessed the problems and crafted legislative solutions that ultimately led to the "Jones Act of 1916," which is possibly his most cunning political triumph. Quezon was cautious of instant independence, but he worked extremely hard in the US House of Representatives to guarantee greater autonomy for his country. He once said, “Considering the time I have been here, the character of the subject, and the influences I had to fight, I feel inclined to say that I am almost surprised that I have secured so much”. Ever since he retired as a Resident Commissioner, he continued to mold the office by selecting and sometimes dismissing his appointees. Quezon was regarded as "bright but lazy," but he showed off his courageous, brash, and irritable combat style when he joined Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary forces during the revolution against Spain. Prior to turning himself in to the Americans in 1899, he was promoted from private to major. After serving six months in prison, he was released and sent back to Manila. Filipinos regard Quezon as the country's second President after Aguinaldo, despite the fact that Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary Republica Filipina was not recognized by other countries. Quezon is known as the "Father of the Republic of the Philippines" and the "Father of Filipino Independence" because of his efforts to encourage the Philippines' independence from the American administration. The Filipino people's peaceful suffrage has elevated him to that eminent position twice. When he speaks, he does so as more than just the official representative of his country. He speaks as the undisputed leader of a race that has pushed him to the top for the last two decades. make a reflection about this please I need this​</a>

                            5. History of the philippines
The history of the Philippines is known to have begun at least 709,000 years ago as suggested by the discovery of Pleistocene stone tools and butchered animal remains associated with hominin activity.[1] Homo luzonensis, a species of archaic humans, was present on the island of Luzon at least 67,000 years ago.[2][3] The earliest known modern human was from the Tabon Caves in Palawan dating about 47,000 years.[4] Negrito groups were the first inhabitants to settle in the prehistoric Philippines.[5] By around 3000 BC, seafaring Austronesians reached northern Philippines migrating southward from Taiwan.[6]
Scholars generally believe that these social groups eventually developed into various settlements or polities with varying degrees of economic specialization, social stratification, and political organization.[7] Some of these settlements (mostly those located on major river deltas) achieved such a scale of social complexity that some scholars believe they should be considered early states.[8] This includes the predecessors of modern-day population centers such as Maynila, Tondo, Pangasinan, Cebu, Panay, Bohol, Butuan, Cotabato, Lanao, and Sulu[9] as well as some polities, such as Ma-i, whose possible location is Mindoro or Laguna.[10]
These polities were either influenced by the Hindu-Buddhist[11] Indian religion, language, culture, literature and philosophy from India through many campaigns from India including the South-East Asia campaign of Rajendra Chola I,[12] Islam from Arabia, or were Sinified tributary states allied to China. These small maritime states flourished from the 1st millennium.[13][14] These kingdoms traded with what are now called China, India, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.[15] The remainder of the settlements were independent barangays allied with one of the larger states. These small states alternated from being part of or being influenced by larger Asian empires like the Ming Dynasty, Majapahit and Brunei or rebelling and waging war against them.
The first recorded visit by Europeans is Ferdinand Magellan's expedition who landed in Homonhon Island, now part of Guiuan, Eastern Samar on March 17, 1521. They lost a battle against the army of Lapulapu, chief of Mactan, where Magellan was killed.[16][17][18] Spanish colonialism began with the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi's expedition on February 13, 1565, from Mexico. He established the first permanent settlement in Cebu.[19] Much of the archipelago came under Spanish rule, creating the first unified political structure known as the Philippines. Spanish colonial rule saw the introduction of Christianity, the code of law, and the oldest modern university in Asia. The Philippines was ruled under the Mexico-based Viceroyalty of New Spain. After this, the colony was directly governed by Spain.
Spanish rule ended in 1898 with Spain's defeat in the Spanish–American War. The Philippines then became a territory of the United States. U.S. forces suppressed a revolution led by Emilio Aguinaldo. The United States established the Insular Government to rule the Philippines. In 1907, the elected Philippine Assembly was set up with popular elections. The U.S. promised independence in the Jones Act.[20] The Philippine Commonwealth was established in 1935, as a 10-year interim step prior to full independence. However, in 1942 during World War II, Japan occupied the Philippines. The U.S. military overpowered the Japanese in 1945. The Treaty of Manila in 1946 established the independent Philippine Republic.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>American influence is certainly much more dominant today. Especially with the language.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I think this is due to the fact that media during the time of Americans is much more accessible. Plus the Americans introduced many reforms in education and health that most Filipinos smile upon. Americans are better and have been preparing Nation Building in the Philippines. In short, the Spaniards culture were simply outdated when the Americans, hence Filipinos chose to adhere more to American cultures and branding. </p><p>But we cannot deny the impact of the Spaniards especially with religion.</p><br />

                            14. introduction During the years of American colonialism and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, Manuel Luis Quezon was arguably the most eminent and well-known pre-war Filipino leader. He was unmatched in his involvement in Philippine affairs during the years from 1907 until his death in 1944. Over the course of a career spanning the duration of American colonial authority in the Philippines, Manuel Luis Quezon possessed unrivaled knowledge of territorial politics, which culminated in his service as the Commonwealth's first president. Quezon originally fought against the United States during its invasion of the islands in the early 1900s, but with to the sheer force of his personality and natural political skill, he rapidly propelled himself into a Resident Commissioner post. He was young and brilliant politician, possessed "an ability and persistence rare and creditable to any representative in any parliament in the world," according to a political rival. In private meetings with the President and influential committee chairs, he assessed the problems and crafted legislative solutions that ultimately led to the "Jones Act of 1916," which is possibly his most cunning political triumph. Quezon was cautious of instant independence, but he worked extremely hard in the US House of Representatives to guarantee greater autonomy for his country. He once said, “Considering the time I have been here, the character of the subject, and the influences I had to fight, I feel inclined to say that I am almost surprised that I have secured so much”. Ever since he retired as a Resident Commissioner, he continued to mold the office by selecting and sometimes dismissing his appointees. Quezon was regarded as "bright but lazy," but he showed off his courageous, brash, and irritable combat style when he joined Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary forces during the revolution against Spain. Prior to turning himself in to the Americans in 1899, he was promoted from private to major. After serving six months in prison, he was released and sent back to Manila. Filipinos regard Quezon as the country's second President after Aguinaldo, despite the fact that Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary Republica Filipina was not recognized by other countries. Quezon is known as the "Father of the Republic of the Philippines" and the "Father of Filipino Independence" because of his efforts to encourage the Philippines' independence from the American administration. The Filipino people's peaceful suffrage has elevated him to that eminent position twice. When he speaks, he does so as more than just the official representative of his country. He speaks as the undisputed leader of a race that has pushed him to the top for the last two decades. make a reflection about this please I need this​</h2><br />
