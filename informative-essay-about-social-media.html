Fact or Bluff
 Nowadays, many Filipinos are confused about every statement that they hear or read in any news platforms. Agreements or disagreements are popping in in social media. Whether these statements are truth or opinion becomes a subject matter for everyone. Thus, the question is: “Is it a fact or a bluff?”
 I think no one values honesty. “BMD denies withholding funds”, “No Filipino is affected by pandemic in the US”, “Bitoy passes away”, “Palacio Filipino unaware of China’s firm”, “No Filipino believes worst of COVID-19 pandemic yet to come”…. These were just a few of headlines that we read on the newspaper and watch over the television, or even read on the online sites. In my opinion, these statements are more of a kind of a bluff than a fact. Moreover, if these are facts then we should have found proofs to verify these statements. Some are manipulating everything to hide the truth. Is it a fact or a bluff?
 I believe that Filipinos deserve to be informed of the truth. For instance, 57% based on the SWS survey of Filipinos believe worst of the pandemic yet to come. How can we enjoy the holiday seasons amidst this prediction? I think no Filipino family can have a merry Christmas this year. All of us will have “tawilis” on our table. Is it a fact or a bluff?

The introduction of social networking sites, in particular, has revolutionized the way we communicate and provided us with an avenue to interact and socialize without having to meet face-to-face with people. 2. Behind all these benefits and advantages, however, lies a myriad of consequences that we often neglect to see. 3. In reality, social networking sites are consuming our lives and daily activities at a rate faster than we can reap their benefits, though some of the adversities may be mitigated through moderation and responsibility. 4. It allow them to continuously socialize with and even meet new people with the same interests, and, not to mention, also keeps them entertained and well-informed with current happenings. 5. Moreover, excessive use of social media distracts us from more important things and activities. 6. Although not immediately visible, social media plays a role in determining a person's mental well-being. 7. Another issue with social networking sites is the fact that it is so liberated that it makes it prone to different risks and crimes. 8. As a result, we, as users of social media, have to be more sensitive and cautions of what we post online in order to prevent harming ourselves or other people. 9. Finally, social media may become a huge distraction to our real lives. 10. All in all, social media is packed with hidden but possibly threatening consequences.​</a>

                            7. Direction: Read the essay below. Choose the statements that show opinions. Write them on a separate answer sheet.
Fact or Bluff
 Nowadays, many Filipinos are confused about every statement that they hear or read in any news platforms. Agreements or disagreements are popping in in social media. Whether these statements are truth or opinion becomes a subject matter for everyone. Thus, the question is: “Is it a fact or a bluff?”
 I think no one values honesty. “BMD denies withholding funds”, “No Filipino is affected by pandemic in the US”, “Bitoy passes away”, “Palacio Filipino unaware of China’s firm”, “No Filipino believes worst of COVID-19 pandemic yet to come”…. These were just a few of headlines that we read on the newspaper and watch over the television, or even read on the online sites. In my opinion, these statements are more of a kind of a bluff than a fact. Moreover, if these are facts then we should have found proofs to verify these statements. Some are manipulating everything to hide the truth. Is it a fact or a bluff?
 I believe that Filipinos deserve to be informed of the truth. For instance, 57% based on the SWS survey of Filipinos believe worst of the pandemic yet to come. How can we enjoy the holiday seasons amidst this prediction? I think no Filipino family can have a merry Christmas this year. All of us will have “tawilis” on our table. Is it a fact or a bluff?
Activity 1: Share your Thoughts. Discuss your answer with an adult in your family and try to exchange ideas on this activity.
1.Were you able to identify opinionated statements and true statements?
2.What was your basis in identifying them?
Was it easy or difficult?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Opinions found :</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>
</p><p>-I think no one values honesty.  </p><p>-In my opinion, these statements are more of a kind of a bluff than a fact.
</p><p>-I believe that Filipinos deserve to be informed of the truth.  </p><p>-I think no Filipino family can have a merry Christmas this year. All of us will have “tawilis” on our table.
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Yes I was able to differentiate facts and opinions.
</p><p>2. It was easy because there are clue words such as "I think", "I believe", and "In my opinion".</p><br />

There are increasing indications that the world will look different after the crisis and that globalization will be questioned in many areas. According to these observations, the COVID-19 crisis would mark a turning point. In times of deep uncertainty, science is asked to look to the future and to flank a rational discourse about how to react to the current global crisis, and therefore now better cope with other tantamount global challenges such as the climate change.</p><p> </p><p>sana po makatulong</p><p></p><br />
