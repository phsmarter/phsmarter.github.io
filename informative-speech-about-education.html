                            28. Write an informative speech about the importance of family in education, decision making and strengthening faith​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Family values are unique to each family; however, they provide families with a perspective on life, a way of viewing the world and their circumstances, as well as a sense of identity by assisting family members in better understanding their history. The fact that values are so important to families is that they can give family members a sense of hope, meaning, and significance, especially when they are faced with challenges and crisis situations, is part of the reason for this. When people aren't living their lives in a way that is consistent with their values, they may even experience feelings of despair.</p><p></p><p>A second reason that values are important is that they serve as a foundation for protection and guidance as well as affection and support.. Instilling family values can protect and guide children against making harmful decisions in the future because they teach them a sense of what is and is not acceptable. They can make a positive contribution to relationships and have an impact on judgments, behaviors, and parenting styles. A great deal of what we do and how we react to different situations and topics is influenced by our personal values. Values provide families with a perspective on life, a way of viewing the world and their circumstances, as well as an identity by assisting family members in better understanding their own history. Family involvement in planning and decision making is important because families know their child best. Family input is instrumental in making sure that the student receives appropriate support, and that necessary changes are made so they can be fully included in the classroom. Research indicates that family and community involvement in schools is associated with improvements in students' academic achievement, higher attendance rates, and improved quality of school programs, as well as improved student behavior and school discipline.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
