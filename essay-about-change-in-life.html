                            1. Makena essay 500 word about self anything change in life​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Humans are not meant to stop growing. In fact, no living thing on earth is meant to stop growing. We are all alive, reaching for the sun.
</p><p>
</p><p>Progress in life is all about reinvention. I am going to preface all of this by saying that reinvention is not the same thing as endlessly seeking reward or achievement. There is a difference. Seeking an achievement usually implies an "end." You win the trophy and then you're "done." That's not what you want to aim for--because as soon as you say you're "done," you are no longer reaching and stretching yourself, which means you stop growing.
</p><p>
</p><p>Reinvention, however, leaves the end open--which is actually a good thing. Reinvention is what allows you endless opportunities to continue exploring new parts of yourself. Exploration is growth, and growth in this sense is not outward facing but inward.
</p><p>
</p><p>Whenever you find something about yourself you want to change, you need to look for a way to reinvent it.
</p><p>
</p><p>1. See yourself outside yourself.
</p><p>Imagine you are a sculptor. A sculptor looks at his or her piece of stone and endlessly questions new ways to shape it. And if he or she thinks of something to change, there is no emotional attachment. They just do it. This is how you need to see yourself--as a work of art, always in progress. No need to get upset, or come down hard on yourself when you see something you do not like. Instead, like an artist, just get to work.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Find the habit associated with the thing you want to change.
</p><p>Far too often, people focus too much on the thing they want to change instead of the habits that formed the thing in the first place. For example: They try to solve being overweight with doing a lot of ab exercises, without acknowledging that the problem is their poor diet. To truly reinvent aspects of yourself, you have to find the habit that created that trait in the first place--and then adjust the habit.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Practice every day, no matter what.
</p><p>Change is not something you do some days and then take a break from other days. Change is a shift in lifestyle. It requires daily dedication, to the point where that new habit takes the place of an old one and no longer requires conscious effort.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Set realistic goals.
</p><p>You can't just wake up one morning and say, "I'm not going to be impatient anymore!" Yes, you are. And you actually help yourself by acknowledging that a bad habit like that won't be solved immediately. Instead, set the goal to be more patient during your team meeting that happens every morning. Use that as an isolated practice space and subconscious reminder of what it is you want to practice. Focus on that for a few weeks, and then go from there.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. Constantly look in the mirror.
</p><p>Things get dangerous when you refuse to stop and really look at yourself--when you avoid self-reflection. There is a time and a place for "go go go" mode, and then there is a time and place for reflection mode. Both are necessary. And you will quickly find that unless you take the time to ask yourself the tough questions, you will fall off track and not know how you got there.
</p><p>
</p><p>6. Surround yourself with people who will tell you the truth.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Change can be difficult, but it is also an inevitable part of life. Whether it is a small change, such as switching up your daily routine, or a larger one, like moving to a new city, change can bring both challenges and opportunities. In my life, I have had to make several changes and each one has taught me something new about myself and the world around me.</p><p>One of the most significant changes I have made in my life was moving to a new city for school. This was a huge step for me, as I had never been away from home for an extended period of time. The transition was difficult at first, as I had to adjust to being on my own, making new friends, and navigating a new environment. However, as time went on, I began to thrive in my new surroundings. I made close friends, discovered new passions, and gained a sense of independence that I never had before. This experience taught me that change can be scary, but it can also be incredibly rewarding if you are open to it.</p><p>Making changes in life can be difficult, but it is also necessary for growth and self-discovery. It can be easy to get comfortable in our routines and to resist change, but it is important to remember that change can bring new opportunities and experiences. In my life, I have learned that it is important to be open to change, to embrace new experiences, and to trust that things will work out in the end.</p><br />

                            3. ESSAY ABOUT HOW DID OUR SUBJECT ON LIFE AND WORKS OF RIZAL CHANGED YOU? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The study of the life and works of Jose Rizal has had a profound impact on my understanding of Philippine history and my own identity as a Filipino.</p><p></p><p>Before studying Rizal, I had a limited understanding of the events that led to the Philippines becoming a colony of Spain, and the subsequent struggle for independence. Through reading Rizal's writings, such as "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo", I gained a deeper understanding of the injustices and oppression that the Filipino people faced during that time. Rizal's writings not only exposed the injustices and corruption of the Spanish colonial government, but also highlighted the resilience and determination of the Filipino people to fight for their rights.</p><p></p><p>Rizal's writings also helped me to better understand the Philippines' cultural identity. Rizal was a true patriot, and his works were infused with pride in the Philippines' unique culture and history. Through his writings, I learned about the customs, traditions, and beliefs of the Philippines, which helped me to appreciate my own heritage.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Rizal's writings also helped me to develop a sense of social responsibility. Rizal was not only a writer, but also a reformer who advocated for the rights of the Filipino people. His example of standing up for what is right, even in the face of oppression, has inspired me to become more engaged in the issues that affect my community and to take action to make a difference.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the study of the life and works of Jose Rizal has changed me in many ways. It has broadened my understanding of Philippine history and culture, and has inspired me to become more socially responsible. Rizal's legacy continues to be a source of inspiration for all Filipinos, and I am proud to be a part of that legacy.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        The coronavirus has transformed life as we know it. Schools are closed, we’re confined to our homes and the future feels very uncertain. Why write at a time like this?<br /><br />For one, we are living through history. Future historians may look back on the journals, essays and art that ordinary people are creating now to tell the story of life during the coronavirus.<br /><br />But writing can also be deeply therapeutic. It can be a way to express our fears, hopes and joys. It can help us make sense of the world and our place in it.<br /><br />Plus, even though school buildings are shuttered, that doesn’t mean learning has stopped. Writing can help us reflect on what’s happening in our lives and form new ideas.<br /><br />

The distribution of fossils across the continents is one line of evidence pointing to the existence of Pangaea.Pangaea Proxima (also called Pangaea Ultima, Neopangaea, and Pangaea II) is a possible future supercontinent configuration. Consistent with the supercontinent cycle, Pangaea Proxima could occur within the next 200 million years.Pangea Ultima is projected as the next supercontinent 250 million years. If you incorporate the velocities and trajectories of current plate movement, then you can model how continents will evolve. The landmass itself would extend 13,000 miles with one superocean covering two-thirds of Earth.</p><br />

He participated in the contention and he used to have a go at instructing me concerning his experience, yet I didn't focus on him. For the present circumstance I was only 13 year old and for me that stuff was debilitating. Without a doubt my sidekicks were a higher need than to focus on him.

I grew up in a caring and nurturing home where I always felt safe and cherished from a young age. My parents always treated me as if I mattered. Throughout my life, I've been a tenacious young man, If things didn't go my way, I used to throw a tantrum. Despite the fact that my mother loved me unconditionally, I was a very demanding child. My mother was always understanding and patient with me, and she used to explain things to me in such a manner that I could understand why things didn't always work out the way I wanted them to. I never wanted to understand her preachings as a child, though. However, a trip to an orphanage on a school trip completely transformed my perspective on life.</p><p></p><p>The place where orphans (children who are homeless and have no parents) are cared for is known as an orphanage. Our school once arranged an educational trip to an orphanage institute when I was in fourth grade. We were instructed to bring whatever we wished to donate. My mum gave me some old toys, clothes, and sweets as a gift. We were able to gather a large amount of information for distribution.</p><p></p><p>All of the children gathered in a hall as we entered the institution. Children of all ages were present. They looked up at us with a hopeful look in their eyes. We were given the task of dispersing the items and spent some time with them. They were ecstatic when they received these old items. We learned from our conversations with them that they only have two or three dresses to choose from. For their food, they'll have a plate and a bowl. The food that was supplied to them was always the same and restricted in quantity. There aren't many meal options for them to choose from. They have the same set of toys to play with. These children have no idea what it is to be loved, cared for, or adored. They have no right to demand anything. I realized all of my mistakes after seeing how horrible every child's situation was. I realized how fortunate I am to be able to enjoy all of the luxuries.</p><p></p><p>When my parents criticized me for not studying correctly, making mistakes, or not listening to them, I didn't enjoy it because they were concerned about every word they uttered. They were there for me at every stage of my life, no matter how ill they were. But I felt so sorry for these children because they don't have the words to express their concern, rage, or affection. For me, going to the orphanage is a life-changing experience. I started to appreciate the little things in life from that day on. I've never been one to demand unexpected things. I feel compelled to assist everyone who is in need. As time went on, I began to grasp my mother's preachings, and, with her aid, I learned how to deal with my own emotions and situations, which formed my conduct and personality in the process. I consider myself exceedingly blessed to have parents who take care of me in every way possible. It is for this reason that I am really grateful.</p><p></p><p>===Ani===</p><p></p>#HopeItHelps^-^<br />
