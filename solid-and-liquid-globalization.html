                                            {A. Classification B. Explanation}
1. Fishes are water animals. A fish usually has tails and paired fins on its back
and on its belly that enable it to swim. Almost all kinds of fish are covered
with scales. Scales are thin but tough sheets arranged all over their bodies.
Fishes also have gills. The gills are found in slits near the head of the fish
behind its mouth. Gills let the fish breathe in water.
2. Non-biodegradable materials are materials that cannot be decomposed. All
materials derived from non-living things are non-biodegradable. Examples of
this are plastic, cans, metals, and rubbers.
3. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object or a material. It can
be measured in grams (g) or kilograms (kg).
4. Brittleness is a property of solids to be broken or shattered into pieces.
Glass and chalk are brittle substances that cannot be bent.
5. Plastics are insulators of heat and therefore, plastics can somehow maintain
the temperature inside the water jug.
6. Matter is composed of tiny building blocks called molecules. Molecules are
further composed of the tiniest part of matter referred to as atoms.
7. Water is essential to life on Earth. It its three phrases (soil, liquid, and gas),
water ties together the major parts of the Earth’s climate. System-air, clouds,
the ocean, lakes, vegetation, snowpack, and glaciers. The water cycle shows
the continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. It is a
complex system that includes many different processes.
8. Angiosperms are classified into monocots and dicots based on the its
characteristics. Monocots are flowering plants that produce seeds with one
seed leaf. Dicots are flowering plants that produce seeds with two seed leaves.
9. Global warming is a serious problem on Earth nowadays. It is the increase
in the average temperature of the earth’s atmosphere.
10. The properties of matter can be classified into two: general and special
properties. General properties are those characteristics that are present in
all kinds of matter. The special properties are those characteristics found in
some materials.</a>

                                            Answer Plss 
A. Classification B. Explanation
_____1. Fishes are water animals. A fish usually has tails and paired fins on its back and on its belly that enable it to swim. Almost all kinds of fish are covered with scales. Scales are thin but tough sheets arranged all over their bodies. Fishes also have gills. The gills are found in slits near the head of the fish behind its mouth. Gills let the fish breathe in water.
_____2. Non-biodegradable materials are materials that cannot be decomposed. All materials derived from non-living things are non-biodegradable. Examples of this are plastic, cans, metals, and rubbers.
_____3. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object or a material. It can be measured in grams (g) or kilograms (kg).
_____4. Brittleness is a property of solids to be broken or shattered into pieces.Glass and chalk are brittle substances that cannot be bent.
_____5. Plastics are insulators of heat and therefore, plastics can somehow maintain the temperature inside the water jug.
_____6. Matter is composed of tiny building blocks called molecules. Molecules are further composed of the tiniest part of matter referred to as atoms.
_____7. Water is essential to life on Earth. It its three phrases (soil, liquid, and gas),water ties together the major parts of the Earth’s climate. System-air, clouds,the ocean, lakes, vegetation, snowpack, and glaciers. The water cycle showsthe continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. It is a complex system that includes many different processes.
_____8. Angiosperms are classified into monocots and dicots based on the its characteristics. Monocots are flowering plants that produce seeds with one seed leaf. Dicots are flowering plants that produce seeds with two seed leaves.
______9. Global warming is a serious problem on Earth nowadays. It is the increase in the average temperature of the earth’s atmosphere.
______10. The properties of matter can be classified into two: general and special properties. General properties are those characteristics that are present in all kinds of matter. The special properties are those characteristics found in some materials.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Liquidity of New Age • Eventhough globalization means more liquidity of everything, solid structures survive in the world. The idea of Flows • Another key concept in thinking about globalization. • Movement of people, things, information, and places due, in part, to the increasing porosity of global barriers.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In this regard, what is liquid globalization?</p><p></p><p>Globalization is increasingly characterized by flows of liquid phenomena including people, objects, decisions, information, and places. Many global flows are interconnected – they do not occur in isolation. Others might be multi-directional flows – all sorts of things flow in every.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, what is the theory of globalization? All theories of globalization have been put hereunder in eight categories: liberalism, political realism, Marxism, constructivism, postmodernism, feminism , Trans-formationalism and eclecticism. Each one of them carries several variations.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, why is globalization a liquid?</p><p></p><p>Because so much of the world has “melted” or is in the process of “melting” and has become liquefied, globalization is increasingly characterized by great flows of increasingly liquid phenomena of all types, including people, objects, information, decisions, places, and so on.</p><p></p><p>What are the metaphors of globalization in contemporary world?</p><p></p><p>Like any aspect of world politics, globalization is bound up in metaphors. The countless and widely varying examples include 'creolization', 'flexibilization', 'glocalization', 'McWorld', and 'virtual reality'. Such utterances generate mental associations that can deeply shape overall knowledge of globalization.</p><br />

                            16. {A. Classification B. Explanation}
1. Fishes are water animals. A fish usually has tails and paired fins on its back
and on its belly that enable it to swim. Almost all kinds of fish are covered
with scales. Scales are thin but tough sheets arranged all over their bodies.
Fishes also have gills. The gills are found in slits near the head of the fish
behind its mouth. Gills let the fish breathe in water.
2. Non-biodegradable materials are materials that cannot be decomposed. All
materials derived from non-living things are non-biodegradable. Examples of
this are plastic, cans, metals, and rubbers.
3. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object or a material. It can
be measured in grams (g) or kilograms (kg).
4. Brittleness is a property of solids to be broken or shattered into pieces.
Glass and chalk are brittle substances that cannot be bent.
5. Plastics are insulators of heat and therefore, plastics can somehow maintain
the temperature inside the water jug.
6. Matter is composed of tiny building blocks called molecules. Molecules are
further composed of the tiniest part of matter referred to as atoms.
7. Water is essential to life on Earth. It its three phrases (soil, liquid, and gas),
water ties together the major parts of the Earth’s climate. System-air, clouds,
the ocean, lakes, vegetation, snowpack, and glaciers. The water cycle shows
the continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. It is a
complex system that includes many different processes.
8. Angiosperms are classified into monocots and dicots based on the its
characteristics. Monocots are flowering plants that produce seeds with one
seed leaf. Dicots are flowering plants that produce seeds with two seed leaves.
9. Global warming is a serious problem on Earth nowadays. It is the increase
in the average temperature of the earth’s atmosphere.
10. The properties of matter can be classified into two: general and special
properties. General properties are those characteristics that are present in
all kinds of matter. The special properties are those characteristics found in
some materials.</h2><br />
