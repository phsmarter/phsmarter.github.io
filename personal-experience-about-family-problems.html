Can you explain the political context of the issue/problem/phenomenon? how can political science help explain and address the issue or problem? ( in the philippines)
(PLEASE ANSWER THIS ONE ABOVE)
ABOUT LGBT
below are my groupmates answers on other questions(IT COULD HELP YOU). and i have to answer that one above. I hope my answer makes sense with my groupmates answers. and even better if the answer is long as my groupmates answers.
What is the issue phenomenon that you choose?
The phenomenon that we chose is the discrimination against LGBT students in the Philippines. Schools should be safe places for everyone. But in the Philippines, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) too often find that their schooling experience is marred by bullying, discrimination, lack of access to LGBT-related information, and some cases of physical or sexual assault. These abuses can cause deep and lasting harm and curtail students' right to education, protected under Philippine and international law.
Can you explain the social content of the issue/problem/phenomenon? How can Sociology help understand and address the issue or problem?
LGBTQ rights as gender rights- Lets us all remember that it is not only women and man who should be considered when gender equality is discussed. True gender equalities deals with the empowerment of the marginalized sector of society; women who are deprived of their basic rights, men who are abused and laughed at due to social anomalies, and the LGBTQ community that continues to face discrimination and hatred, which hinder their full potential as persons and human beings. 
Sociology examines the relationship between individuals and society, which includes social institutions like the family, gender, military, economy and education. As a social science, sociology offers an objective and systematic approach to understanding the causes of social problems.</a>

                            29. I GIVE YOU 100 POINTS
Can you explain the political context of the issue/problem/phenomenon? how can political science help explain and address the issue or problem? ( in the philippines)
(PLEASE ANSWER THIS ONE ABOVE)
ABOUT LGBT
below are my groupmates answers on other questions(IT COULD HELP YOU). and i have to answer that one above. I hope my answer makes sense with my groupmates answers. and even better if the answer is long as my groupmates answers.
What is the issue phenomenon that you choose?
The phenomenon that we chose is the discrimination against LGBT students in the Philippines. Schools should be safe places for everyone. But in the Philippines, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) too often find that their schooling experience is marred by bullying, discrimination, lack of access to LGBT-related information, and some cases of physical or sexual assault. These abuses can cause deep and lasting harm and curtail students' right to education, protected under Philippine and international law.
Can you explain the social content of the issue/problem/phenomenon? How can Sociology help understand and address the issue or problem?
LGBTQ rights as gender rights- Lets us all remember that it is not only women and man who should be considered when gender equality is discussed. True gender equalities deals with the empowerment of the marginalized sector of society; women who are deprived of their basic rights, men who are abused and laughed at due to social anomalies, and the LGBTQ community that continues to face discrimination and hatred, which hinder their full potential as persons and human beings. 
Sociology examines the relationship between individuals and society, which includes social institutions like the family, gender, military, economy and education. As a social science, sociology offers an objective and systematic approach to understanding the causes of social problems.</h2><br />
