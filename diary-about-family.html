There was even a time that we went to my grandfather's house and my sister dropped her phone at the family pond, so she went looking at it and we all ended up taking an hour at the lake, covered with water. It was the best. I hope this will be happening again at the near future.

My future husband will be strong and kind, he will love me. One day we would buy a house. I don’t want to have a big house, it should be little, quite and cozy. Maybe we will have children. I want to have a little daughter so that I can play with her. I would teach her to read, to write, to swim, to dance. I know that children is a big responsibility.<br />
