Taxation not only pays for public goods and services; it is also a key ingredient in the social contract between citizens ard the economy. Helps build the Nation. The cost of running an entire country, especialy one that is as large and populated as ours, is humongous. It is through the taxes we pay that the government can perform civil operations. In other words, without taxes, it would be impossible for the government to run the country. 8​</a>

                                            Make an expository text about this information. Department of National Defense (DND) officer-in-charge Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. clarified that the proposed enhanced Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program would allow trainees to beef up their resilience and character -- qualities that are believed to foster good mental health. The DND chief made this clarification Monday night after some reports claimed that ROTC would help "cure" or address mental health issues. "We have learned of the sensitivities raised by our mental health practitioners and advocates on what they believe is the improper use at the Senate hearing on Monday, February 6, of the word 'cure' for mental health issues," Galvez said. The DND chief said they understood and appreciated the concerns of these groups as mental health is an issue that affects the broadest spectrum of society. "What we intended to convey during the hearing was that through our enhanced ROTC program, we would be able to build the strength of character and resilience of our trainees, qualities which positively foster mental health," Galvez said. He also added that the ROTC program also aims to develop among the trainees the basic psychosocial support competencies that are crucial in responding to stressful situations and contexts. Galvez stressed that the ROTC program they envisioned in the DND includes courses that are specifically designed to foster resilience, self-leadership, character-building and discipline. "We believe these are virtues that our trainees must cultivate not only for their personal growth and development as individuals, but more importantly, enable them to play a key role in building a just, humane and democratic society," he added. Galvez also assured the public that DND leadership shall carefully take into account the spirit of Republic Act 11036 (Mental Health Act of 2018) and the issues raised by our mental health experts in the crafting of the ROTC training program.​</a>

In other words, without taxes, it would be impossible for the government to run the country. 8​</h2><br />

                            7. Make an expository text about this information. Department of National Defense (DND) officer-in-charge Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. clarified that the proposed enhanced Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program would allow trainees to beef up their resilience and character -- qualities that are believed to foster good mental health. The DND chief made this clarification Monday night after some reports claimed that ROTC would help "cure" or address mental health issues. "We have learned of the sensitivities raised by our mental health practitioners and advocates on what they believe is the improper use at the Senate hearing on Monday, February 6, of the word 'cure' for mental health issues," Galvez said. The DND chief said they understood and appreciated the concerns of these groups as mental health is an issue that affects the broadest spectrum of society. "What we intended to convey during the hearing was that through our enhanced ROTC program, we would be able to build the strength of character and resilience of our trainees, qualities which positively foster mental health," Galvez said. He also added that the ROTC program also aims to develop among the trainees the basic psychosocial support competencies that are crucial in responding to stressful situations and contexts. Galvez stressed that the ROTC program they envisioned in the DND includes courses that are specifically designed to foster resilience, self-leadership, character-building and discipline. "We believe these are virtues that our trainees must cultivate not only for their personal growth and development as individuals, but more importantly, enable them to play a key role in building a just, humane and democratic society," he added. Galvez also assured the public that DND leadership shall carefully take into account the spirit of Republic Act 11036 (Mental Health Act of 2018) and the issues raised by our mental health experts in the crafting of the ROTC training program.​</h2><br />

I strongly believe that<strong> </strong><strong>Bayanihan</strong><strong> </strong>and the <strong>strong practice of respect</strong> should be <strong>essential </strong>in all nations. Bayanihan or the act of volunteering can help in the unison of the community. And we all know that a <strong>united </strong>community can reach <strong>greater heights</strong> in its progress. Respect is also a core trait of being a Filipino. However, in our case, it is only about respect for the elders, which I would like to <strong>change </strong>if I'm going to build a nation. I strongly believe that <strong>respect should be given to everyone</strong> regardless of age. It is also a part of inclusivity which is an emerging issue in today's society after studies show that an inclusive community means there are <strong>fewer inequalities</strong> which translates to a <strong>progressive nation. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Learn more about The Filipino Way here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2590627</p><p>#SPJ1</p><p><strong></strong></p><br />
