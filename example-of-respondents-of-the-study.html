the variables of the study and construct a conceptual framework.
Research Hypothesis
A hypothesis is a prediction of the possible outcomes of a study (Fraenkel &amp;
Wallen, 2009). Hypotheses are statements in quantitative research in which the
investigator makes a prediction or a conjecture about the outcome of a relationship
among attributes or characteristics (Creswell, 2012)
Example of a Research 
Hypothesis
Question: Is there a significant 
relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?
Null Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between the Grade 11 student-
respondents' availability of internet connection at home and their average sleeping
time?

ABSTRACTThe study determines the frequency of performance activities employed by senior high mathematics teachers and its relationship to the attitude of the students towards the subject. It is a division-wide study which includes six hundred forty-four (644) grade 12 students of the three pioneering public senior high schools in Dumaguete City, as the respondents. Results showed that the respondents experienced performance activities in their Mathematics classes every class session (46.10%) followed by every other class session (37.54%) and then once a week (13.24%). It was revealed in the study that the respondents are very positive in learning Math when they can communicate with classmates and do performance activities. The respondents believed that Math concepts are important in everyday living. It was also found out that sex and age are not influencing factors in the students' attitude in Mathematics and the more frequent the teachers give performance and group activities, the more positive the attitude of the students become in learning Mathematics. Findings of the study were disseminated to encourage teachers to continuously provide hands-on and other performance tasks to develop positive attitude towards the subject. The present K to 12 grading system of the Department of Education which gives emphasis on performance tasks should be continuously utilized. Evaluation:​</a>

                        <p>I have accepted the fact that people who suffer from anxiety and depression will never be cured. Therapy is always there but I've never really seen it as an option probably because I live in the Philippines. However, I meet more and more people who have chosen to get help and so far, there are mixed opinions. The Philippines already has the Mental Health Act approved by the two houses of the senate which hopefully will be passed into law this year (2018). It's a clear indication that the country is moving towards making people aware of mental health and helping those who are in constant battle with mental health problems.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

ABSTRACTThe study determines the frequency of performance activities employed by senior high mathematics teachers and its relationship to the attitude of the students towards the subject. It is a division-wide study which includes six hundred forty-four (644) grade 12 students of the three pioneering public senior high schools in Dumaguete City, as the respondents. Results showed that the respondents experienced performance activities in their Mathematics classes every class session (46.10%) followed by every other class session (37.54%) and then once a week (13.24%). It was revealed in the study that the respondents are very positive in learning Math when they can communicate with classmates and do performance activities. The respondents believed that Math concepts are important in everyday living. It was also found out that sex and age are not influencing factors in the students' attitude in Mathematics and the more frequent the teachers give performance and group activities, the more positive the attitude of the students become in learning Mathematics. Findings of the study were disseminated to encourage teachers to continuously provide hands-on and other performance tasks to develop positive attitude towards the subject. The present K to 12 grading system of the Department of Education which gives emphasis on performance tasks should be continuously utilized. Evaluation:​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>TYPES OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT</p><p>COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT MODELS</p><p>The following community engagement models are supported by the Office of Community Engagement through community-engaged learning courses, student employment, or volunteer opportunities for groups or individuals.</p><p></p><p>Community Building</p><p>Projects that intentionally bring people together to simply get to know one another. Examples include the Morris Community Meal.</p><p></p><p>Community Education</p><p>Projects that provide instructional services or curricula, or serve to educate the public about a social issue (in a non-partisan way). Examples include the TREC program, Community ESL classes, and Gather in the Park.</p><p></p><p>Community Organizing</p><p>Projects that bring people together with the goal of solving a community issue. Please note that OCE cannot work on partisan issues, but can contribute to creating solutions for non-partisan, local issues. An example is assistance in establishing the Latino Parent Advisory Board for the local school.</p><p></p><p>Deliberative Dialogue</p><p>Projects that intentionally bring people together to build understanding across differences.</p><p></p><p>Direct Service</p><p>Projects that provide a service or product to an individual, group, or the community as a whole. Examples include filling a volunteer shift at a local organization, creating social media tools for an organization, or creating a community mural.</p><p></p><p>Economic Development</p><p>Projects that work on developing the regional economy in a sustainable way. Note that OCE does not partner with for-profit entities except when doing so would benefit the community as a whole and not the for-profit only organization. Examples include feasibility studies for new businesses and projects that attract people to small town business disricts.</p><p></p><p>Engaged Research</p><p>Research that directly benefits the community by clarifying the causes of a community challenge, mapping a community's assets, or contributing to solutions to current challenges and also fits a faculty member's research agenda. In the best case scenario, faculty with research expertise work alongside community members and students on such projects. An example would be the MIEI community needing assessment.</p><p></p><p>Institutional Engagement</p><p>University resources intentionally offered without undue barriers to the community. OCE can play a role in envisioning institutional engagement efforts. Examples include making Briggs library cards available for community members, making campus events accessible, and choosing to use local and sustainable businesses to supply services or goods.</p><p></p><p>Give 1 Example of Community Engagement and atleast 3 objectives</p><br />
