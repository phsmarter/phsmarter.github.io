                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Marxism is a social, political, and economic philosophy named after Karl Marx. It examines the effect of capitalism on labor, productivity, and economic development and argues for a worker revolution to overturn capitalism in favor of communism. Marxism posits that the struggle between social classes—specifically between the bourgeoisie, or capitalists, and the proletariat, or workers—defines economic relations in a capitalist economy and will inevitably lead to revolutionary communism.</p><p></p><p>KEY TAKEAWAYS</p><p>Marxism is a social, political, and economic theory originated by Karl Marx that focuses on the struggle between capitalists and the working class.</p><p>Marx wrote that the power relationships between capitalists and workers were inherently exploitative and would inevitably create class conflict.</p><p>He believed that this conflict would ultimately lead to a revolution in which the working class would overthrow the capitalist class and seize control of the economy.</p><p>Understanding Marxism</p><p>Marxism is both a social and political theory, which encompasses Marxist class conflict theory and Marxian economics. Marxism was first publicly formulated in 1848 in the pamphlet The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, which lays out the theory of class struggle and revolution. Marxian economics focuses on the criticisms of capitalism, which Karl Marx wrote about in his book Das Kapital, published in 1867.12</p><p></p><p>Class conflict and the demise of capitalism</p><p>Marx’s class theory portrays capitalism as one step in the historical progression of economic systems that follow one another in a natural sequence. They are driven, he posited, by vast impersonal forces of history that play out through the behavior and conflict among social classes. According to Marx, every society is divided into social classes, whose members have more in common with one another than with members of other social classes.</p><p></p><p>The following are elements of Marx’s theories of how class conflict would play out in a capitalist system.</p><p></p><p>Capitalist society is made up of two classes: the bourgeoisie, or business owners, who control the means of production, and the proletariat, or workers, whose labor transforms raw commodities into valuable economic goods.</p><p>Ordinary laborers, who do not own the means of production, such as factories, buildings, and materials, have little power in the capitalist economic system. Workers are also readily replaceable in periods of high unemployment, further devaluing their perceived worth.</p><p>To maximize profits, business owners have an incentive to get the most work out of their laborers while paying them the lowest possible wages. This creates an unfair imbalance between owners and laborers, whose work the owners exploit for their own gain.</p><p>Because workers have little personal stake in the process of production, Marx believed they would become alienated from it, as well as from their own humanity, and turn resentful toward business owners.</p><p>The bourgeoisie also employ social institutions, including government, media, academia, organized religion, and banking and financial systems, as tools and weapons against the proletariat with the goal of maintaining their position of power and privilege.3</p><p>Ultimately, the inherent inequalities and exploitative economic relations between these two classes will lead to a revolution in which the working class rebels against the bourgeoisie, takes control of the means of production, and abolishes capitalism.</p><p>Thus Marx thought that the capitalist system inherently contained the seeds of its own destruction. The alienation and exploitation of the proletariat that are fundamental to capitalist relations would inevitably drive the working class to rebel against the bourgeoisie and seize control of the means of production. This revolution would be led by enlightened leaders, known as “the vanguard of the proletariat,” who understood the class structure of society and who would unite the working class by raising awareness and class consciousness.</p><p></p><p>As a result of the revolution, Marx predicted that private ownership of the means of production would be replaced by collective ownership, first under socialism and then under communism. In the final stage of human development, social classes and class struggle would no longer exist.</p><p></p><p>Karl Marx believed that the proletariat would overthrow capitalism in a violent revolution.</p><p></p><p>Communism vs. Socialism vs. Capitalism</p><p>Marx and Engels' ideas laid the groundwork for the theory and practice of communism, which advocates for a classless system in which all property and wealth are communally (rather than privately) owned. Although the former Soviet Union, China, and Cuba (among other nations) have had nominally communist governments, there’s never actually been a purely communist state that has completely eliminated personal property, money, and class systems.</p><p></p><p>.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

DepEd Kto12 Program2.	School Rules and Regulation3.	The Philippine Political Structurepaki sagot plsssss​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The DepEd Kto12 Program is an educational reform program in the Philippines that aims to enhance the quality of education and prepare Filipino students for the demands of the 21st century. It is an expansion of the previous 10-year basic education curriculum to a 12-year program that includes Kindergarten, six years of elementary education, four years of junior high school, and two years of senior high school. The program focuses on providing students with a more holistic and relevant education, with a curriculum that includes academic, technical-vocational, and sports and arts tracks. It also aims to produce graduates who are better equipped to pursue higher education, entrepreneurship, or employment.</p><p></p><p>The DepEd Kto12 Program has been implemented in stages since 2011 and has faced various challenges, including inadequate facilities, teacher shortages, and curriculum gaps. However, it has also received support from various stakeholders, including the government, educators, parents, and students. The program has been seen as a step towards addressing the country's education system's shortcomings and ensuring that Filipino students are better prepared for the challenges of the future.</p><p></p><p>Source: https://www.deped.gov.ph/k-to-12/about-k-to-12/</p><p></p><p>2. School rules and regulations are essential in maintaining a safe and orderly learning environment for students. These rules may vary from school to school, but common examples include dress codes, attendance policies, disciplinary procedures, and academic standards. The primary purpose of school rules is to promote student welfare and academic success by establishing clear expectations for behavior and conduct. These rules help students develop responsibility, respect, and self-discipline, and ensure that they are able to focus on their studies without distraction or disruption.</p><p></p><p>However, the implementation of school rules and regulations should also take into account the unique needs and circumstances of individual students. It is important to consider the socio-economic background, culture, and beliefs of students to avoid discrimination or marginalization. Effective communication and collaboration between school administrators, teachers, parents, and students are also essential in ensuring that school rules are fair, reasonable, and consistently enforced.</p><p></p><p>Source: https://www.edutopia.org/article/why-rules-matter-school</p><p></p><p>3. The Philippine political structure is a democratic republic with a presidential system of government. The country's political system is governed by a written constitution, which sets out the powers and functions of the three branches of government: the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The president is the head of state and government, and is elected every six years through a popular vote. The legislative branch is composed of a bicameral congress, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The judicial branch is independent and is composed of various courts, including the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, and Regional Trial Courts.</p><p></p><p>The Philippine political structure has undergone various changes and challenges throughout history, including periods of martial law and political instability. The country's political system has also been shaped by various cultural and social factors, including the influence of religion, ethnic diversity, and economic development. Despite these challenges, the Philippines has continued to uphold its democratic ideals, with a vibrant civil society, free press, and active citizen participation in governance.</p><p></p><p>Source: https://www.state.gov/reports/2019-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/philippines/</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Spanish colonial period in the Philippines was the period during which the Philippines were part of the Spanish Empire as the Captaincy General of the Philippines from 1565 to 1898. The islands were part of the larger Spanish East Indies. Forty-four years after Ferdinand Magellan landed in the Philippines and died in the Battle of Mactan in 1521, the Spanish explored and colonialized the islands, starting with the founding of Cebu by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi in 1565. Manila was made the capital of the Philippines in 1571. This was the time of the reign of King Philip II of Spain, whose name has remained attached to the country. The Spanish colonial period ended with the Philippine Revolution and Spanish-American War in 1898, which marked the beginning of the American colonialization of the Philippines</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sana makatulong</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Poverty can be defined as a state of affairs in which a family's fundamental requirements, such as food, shelter, clothes, and education, are not met on a regular basis. It can lead to a variety of additional issues, such as low literacy, unemployment, starvation, and so on. Because of a lack of financial resources, a poor individual is unable to further their education and hence remains unemployed. An unemployed guy is unable to provide his family with enough and healthy food, resulting in their health deteriorating. A person who is physically weak will be unable to perform the necessary tasks. A person who is out of work will always be destitute. This leads us to believe that poverty is at the heart of all social problems.</p><p></p><p>"Poverty is not a natural phenomenon; it is a result of human activity." The statement above is correct because the majority of the causes of poverty are the result of human activity. There are several factors that contribute to poverty, but the most significant is population growth. The growing population is placing an increasing strain on the resources and budgets of governments. To feed, house, and provide jobs for an increasing number of people, governments are finding it increasingly difficult.</p><p></p><p>Other factors include a lack of education, conflict, natural disasters, a lack of work, a lack of infrastructure, political instability, and a variety of other factors as well. For example, if a person is unable to find work, he or she will become unemployed and will be unable to earn enough money to meet the basic needs of his or her family, resulting in poverty. A person's lack of education forces him to choose lower-paying occupations, which further impoverishes him. Lack of infrastructure means that a country lacks industries, banks, and other financial institutions, which results in a lack of employment prospects. Natural calamities such as floods and earthquakes are also a contributing factor to poverty.</p><br />
