                            2. give examples of how Definition and Classification is applied beyond writing academic essays​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>
</p><p>1: Choose an abstract word with a complex meaning.[1]
</p><p>A simple word that refers to a concrete word will not give you much to write about, but a complex word that refers to an abstract concept provides more material to explore.
</p><p>
</p><p>Typically, nouns that refer to a person, place, or thing are too simple for a definition essay. Nouns that refer to an idea work better, however, as do most adjectives.
</p><p>For example, the word “house” is fairly simple and an essay written around it may be dull. By switching to something slightly more abstract like “home,” however, you can play around with the definition more. A “home” is a concept, and there are many elements involved in the creation of a “home.” In comparison, a “house” is merely a structure.
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>2: Make sure that the word is disputable.
</p><p>Aside from being complex, the word should also refer to something that can mean different things to different people.
</p><p>
</p><p>A definition essay is somewhat subjective by nature since it requires you to analyze and define a word from your own perspective. If the answer you come up with after analyzing a word is the same answer anyone else would come up with, your essay may appear to lack depth.
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>3: Choose a word you have some familiarity with.
</p><p>Dictionary definitions can only tell you so much. Since you need to elaborate on the word you choose to define, you will need to have your own base of knowledge or experience with the concept you choose.
</p><p>
</p><p>For instance, if you have never heard the term “pedantic,” your understanding of the word will be limited. You can introduce yourself to the word for your essay, but without previous understanding of the concept, you will not know if the definition you describe is truly fitting.
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>4: Read the dictionary definition.
</p><p>While you will not be relying completely on the dictionary definition for your essay, familiarizing yourself with the official definition will allow you to compare your own understanding of the concept with the simplest, most academic explanation of it.
</p><p>
</p><p>As an example, one definition of “friend” is “a person attached to another by feelings of affection or personal regard.”[2] Your own ideas or beliefs about what a “friend” really is likely include much more information, but this basic definition can present you with a good starting point in forming your own.
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>5: Research the word’s origins.
</p><p>Look up your chosen word in the Oxford English Dictionary or in another etymology dictionary.[3]
</p><p>
</p><p>These sources can tell you the history behind a word, which can provide further insight on a general definition as well as information about how a word came to mean what it means today</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A definition essay can be deceivingly difficult to write. This type of paper requires you to write a personal yet academic definition of one specific word. The definition must be thorough and lengthy. It is essential that you choose a word that will give you plenty to write about, and there are a few standard tactics you can use to elaborate on the term. Here are a few guidelines to keep in mind when writing a definition essay.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1: <strong>Choose an abstract word with a complex meaning.</strong></p><p></p><p>2: <strong>Make sure that the word is disputable.</strong></p><p></p><p>3: <strong>Choose a word you have some familiarity with</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            3. ESSAY GIVE YOUR OWN EXAMPLE SENTENCES/DIALOGUES OF EACH CLASSIFICATION. 5 SENTENCES/DIALOGUES IN EACH CLASSIFICATION Oral Communication in Context​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>
</p>1. Directed Dialogues
<p>It is considered as the simplest kind of interlocution that is used in literary writing. This interaction happens directly between two people – character A &amp; character B.
</p><p>
</p><p>“What did you eat for breakfast?”
</p><p>
</p><p>“Eggs and ham.”
</p><p>
</p>2. Misdirected Dialogue
<p>This looks like a natural communication between two participants where they do not answer direct questions. The tone and the manner of the communication might vary only when a third participant interrupts in the conversation.
</p><p>
</p><p>“It’s pretty sunny.”
</p><p>
</p><p>“Then it’s a good day to have a picnic.”
</p><p>
</p>3. Modulated Conversation
<p>In this type of dialogue, the conversation provides important details. This generally increases the tension of narration or it might reveal the key aspect of the conversation. It is the gradual retrospection and a way to develop a plot or observation.
</p><p>
</p><p>“You are never around when I was growing up.”
</p><p>
</p><p>“I had to work very hard so you can grow up.”
</p><p>
</p>4. Interpolation Conversation
<p>This type of conversation is used for the insertion. In simple words, interpret some information where you are not given important details directly.  
</p><p>
</p><p>“I’m having a fever.”
</p><p>
</p><p>“You must have colds.”
</p><p>
</p>5. Inner (Internal) Dialogue  
<p>In inner (internal) dialogue, the people speak to themselves and express their attitudes or opinions.  People use inner dialogue to express their flow of consciousness and loneliness.  
</p><p>
</p><p>Example:
</p><p>
</p><p>‘Want to come over to my place and watch television?’ John asks as the train pulls out of town. ‘It’s Thunderbirds today.’
</p><p>
</p>6. Outer Dialogue  
<p>Outer dialogue is a dialogue where people talk to other people. It is a classical dialogue and this type of dialogue is seen most of the time.  
</p><p>
</p><p>Example of dialogues:
</p><p>
</p><p>• In first-person narration:
</p><p>
</p><p>• I cannot believe I hurt my brother. Will he ever forgive me?
</p><p>
</p><p>• In third-person narration:
</p><p>
</p><p>• “I cannot believe I hurt my brother. Will he ever forgives me?” wondered James.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We’ve been focusing on broad categories of reading materials so far: literature, journalism, textbooks, and academic writing. Since most of the reading (and writing!) you’ll do throughout your college career falls into the “academic writing” category, this is a good point to slow down and examine the building blocks of academic writing more closely.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>i wish this help</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The purpose of narration is to tell a story or relate an event. Narration is an especially useful tool for sequencing or putting details and information into some kind of logical order, usually chronological. Literature uses narration heavily, but it also can be useful in non-fiction, academic writing for strong impact.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>2. The purpose of description is to recreate, invent, or visually present a person, place, event, or action so that the reader can picture that which is being described. It is heavily based on sensory details: sight, sound, smell, feel, taste.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>3.Defintion moves beyond a dictionary definition to deeply examine a word or concept as we actually use and understand it.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>4.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>5.Comparison focuses on similarities between things, and contrast focuses on their differences. We innately make comparisons all the time, and they appear in many kinds of writings. The goal of comparison and contrast in academic essays is generally to show that one item is superior to another, based on a set of evaluations included as part of the writing.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>6 .Classification takes one large concept, and divides it into individual pieces. A nice result from this type of writing is that it helps the reader to understand a complex topic by focusing on its smaller parts. This is particularly useful when an author has a unique way of dividing the concepts, to provide new insight into the ways it could be viewed.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>7.Analyzing a process can also be thought of as “how-to” instruction. Technical writing includes a lot of process analysis, for instance. Academic writing can incorporate process analysis to show how an existing problem came to be, or how it might be solved, by following a clear series of steps.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>8.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>9.This type of academic writing has two equally important tasks: clearly identifying a problem, and then providing a logical, practical solution for that problem. Establishing that a particular situation IS a problem can sometimes be a challenge–many readers might assume that a given situation is “just the way it is,” for instance.</p><p></p><p>decorative image</p><p>Often in your academic studies, you will be asked to apply a specific thinking pattern in an essay assignment. For example:</p><p></p>Compare the economic theories of Maynard Keynes and Milton Friedman. (comparison and contrast)Discuss the effects of the U.S. civil war on the U.S. cotton industry during and in the decade immediately after the war. (cause and effect)Identify the different literary techniques that Faulkner applies in his short story, “A Rose for Emily,” explaining how he uses each technique to add to the suspense of the story.

 1. Since the meaning of a word can change through time and the perception of any word can also be interpreted differently by people, it is necessary to put a denotation so that there is an experience-based definition in the essay.
 2. Connotation and extended definition are optional in writing a definition essay because people have different interpretations of words and concepts and including them would only confuse readers.
 3. The process of explaining and giving examples to clarify how the writer understand a concept is called persuasion.
 4. The main purpose of exemplification is to make even more understandable complex ideas, concepts, words, and expressions to your target readers.
 5. Enumerating facts is a technique in exemplification that relies on the individual interpretations of people on certain events, situations, ideas and concepts in supporting your point.
 6. When dealing with a Supportive Audience, pathos is the most effective appeal that you can use.
 7. Specifically in essay writing, comparison cannot be done alone nor contrast because they are complementary to each other.
 8. Personification is a technique in comparison and contrast that assigns the characteristics of non-humans to human to personify the subject.
 9. Causal Analysis can be translated into this diagram:
EFFECTS → SITUATION → CAUSES. Meaning, the author may present the causes towards the effects, or begin with the effects and proceed towards cause.
 10. The effect is what prompted something to happen.
 11. Detailing the process and giving directions are parts of explanatory mode of paragraph development.
 12. Explanation or discussion aims to make the readers understand and explain a particular statement or a theory.
 13. Classification entails categorization, which enables one to group together items according to their similarities.
 14. Exclusiveness, in a paragraph of classification, is characterized by having parallel similarities in the divisions you make in your writing.
 15. Division is a technique in classification wherein the concept or topic is broken down into its essential parts.</h2><br />

Sa kasagsagan nito, higit sa 188 bansa, na sumasaklaw sa humigit-kumulang 91% ng mga naka-enroll na mag-aaral sa buong mundo, ay nagsara ng kanilang mga paaralan upang subukang pigilan ang pagkalat ng virus.1 Ang mga pagsasara ng paaralan ay may tunay na epekto sa lahat ng mga mag-aaral, ngunit lalo na sa mga pinaka-mahina. na mas malamang na makaharap ng karagdagang mga hadlang.2 Mga bata at kabataan mula sa mga pamilyang mababa ang kita at solong magulang; imigrante, refugee,3 etnikong minorya4 at Katutubo5 background; na may magkakaibang pagkakakilanlan ng kasarian6 at oryentasyong sekswal;7 at ang mga may pangangailangan sa espesyal na edukasyon8 ay nagdurusa sa pamamagitan ng pagkakaitan ng mga pagkakataon sa pisikal na pag-aaral, suportang panlipunan at emosyonal na makukuha sa mga paaralan at mga karagdagang serbisyo tulad ng mga pagkain sa paaralan.9 Nanganganib silang mahuli at mahiwalay sa paaralan. sarado ang mga pinto.

Higit pa sa mga pagsasara ng paaralan, sinusuri din ng Policy Brief na ito ang isyu ng muling pagbubukas ng paaralan sa pamamagitan ng paglalahad ng mga kasalukuyang hakbang ng mga bansa at pagbibigay ng mga policy pointer na naglalayong tiyakin na ang pandemya ay hindi higit na makakahadlang sa pagsasama ng mga mahihinang estudyante sa mga sistema ng edukasyon.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana maka tulong po pa brailiest nalang po</p><br />
