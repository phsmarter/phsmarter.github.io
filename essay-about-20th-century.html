</p><p>Communist Leaders of the 20th Century
</p><p>
</p><p>Vladimir Lenin, Ho Chi Minh and Moa Zedong were all leaders who were visionaries and revolutionaries who changed the world. They used communist ideals and propaganda to engage peasants and the working class to fight for freedom and to preserve their cultural values. Each leader and his followers successfully changed the economic and political structure of their countries as well as influencing the rest of the world for decades to come.
</p><p>
</p><p>Vladimir Lenin – Russian Revolutionary
</p><p>
</p><p>Prologue
</p><p>
</p><p>Vladimir Lenin was a Bolshevik Leader for the 1917 October Revolution, and the first Head of State for the Soviet Union.</p><br /><p>Driven by oppression and exploitation of the working classes, he was totally dedicated to the cause, even ending friendships that obstructed the movement’s progress. He masterminded the Bolshevik takeover of power in Russia in 1917, known as the October Revolution.
</p><p>
</p><p>Situational Events
</p><p>
</p><p>During the First World War, Russia was suffering and in chaos and Lenin took his chance to overthrow the provisional government and founded the first Socialist state in the world. In power the Bolshevik Party became known as the Communist Party and the realities of governing such a huge and diverse country, brought to its knees by war, famine and disease, quickly displaced the aspirations and optimism of the people’s revolution. Certainly, Lenin was intelligent, enthusiastic, and a strong willed person. However, possession of the all those traits does not necessarily explain the phenomena of being an effective leader. At the same time, the situational factors are very important considerations that influence success or failure. Situational influences play crucial role in leadership success. There were many critical situational factors that had an effect on the revolutionary process in October 1917.
</p><p>
</p><p>• The country was exhausted by war with Germany (the I World War 1914-1917).
</p><p>
</p><p>• The Government did not have enough money to continue the war.</p><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>SIMILARITIES:</p><p></p><p>The art of the 20th century embraced the newness of a new era. Rejecting realistic representation and traditional aesthetics, various styles of Abstract Expressionism arose, the most prominent and influential of which was Cubism. A lot of revolutionized genres of arts emerged in the 20th century. It became more rebellious and broke out of conventions. Contemporary movements and developments came out such as Dadaism, Abstract Expressionism, and others.</p><p></p><p>DIFFERENCES:</p><p></p><p>Although in the 20th century, arts have changed drastically, the differences between the arts have larger gaps due to creative differences and more discoveries. As most art forms are contemporary, some took a twist on the traditional takes. Most 20th-century art pieces are based on pop cultures like Hollywood, Literature, music, and more. Some art forms reflect political agendas like Soviet and Communism propaganda which is an ironic take and is a polar opposite on other art forms. Other art forms promote freedom of creativity, breaking out of conservatism. However, political arts are meant to control and throw over subversive ideas. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>20th-century classical music describes art music that was written nominally from 1901 to 2000, inclusive. Musical style diverged during the 20th century as it never had previously. Consequently, this century was without a dominant style. Modernism, impressionism, and post-romanticism can all be traced to the decades before the turn of the century, but can be included because they evolved beyond the musical boundaries of the 19th-century styles that were part of the earlier common practice period. Neoclassicism and expressionism came mostly after 1900. Minimalism started much later in the century and can be seen as a change from the modern to post-modern era, although some date post-modernism from as early as ca. 1930. Aleatory, atonality, serialism, musique concrète, electronic music, and concept music were all developed during this century. Jazz and ethnic folk music became important influences on many composers during this century.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helped</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Not to be confused with contemporary art, the “modern art” label refers to late 19th and early-to-mid 20th century art. Works produced during this time showcase artists' interest in re-imagining, reinterpreting, and even rejecting traditional aesthetic values of preceding styles.</p><p>Although many different styles are encompassed by the term, there are certain underlying principles that define modernist art: A rejection of history and conservative values (such as realistic depiction of subjects); innovation and experimentation with form (the shapes, colours and lines that make up the work).Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s, and denotes the styles and philosophies of the art produced during that era. The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation.Post modern art is a body of art movements that sought to contradict some aspects of modernism or some aspects that emerged or developed in its aftermath. In general, movements such as intermedia, installation art, conceptual art and multimedia, particularly involving video are described as postmodern.</p><p></p><p>explaination:</p><p></p><p>hope you understand thank you</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES OF ARTWORKS IN THE 20TH CENTURY
<p>
</p><p><strong> SIMILARITIES:</strong>
</p><p>The art of the 20th century embraced the newness of a new era. Rejecting realistic representation and traditional aesthetics, various styles of Abstract Expressionism arose, the most prominent and influential of which was Cubism. A lot of revolutionized genres of arts emerged in the 20th century. It became more rebellious and broke out of conventions. Contemporary movements and developments came out such as Dadaism, Abstract Expressionism, and others. </p><p>
</p><p><strong>DIFFERENCES:</strong>
</p><p>Although in the 20th century, arts have changed drastically, the differences between the arts have larger gaps due to creative differences and more discoveries. As most art forms are contemporary, some took a twist on the traditional takes. Most 20th-century art pieces are based on pop cultures like Hollywood, Literature, music, and more. Some art forms reflect political agendas like Soviet and Communism propaganda which is an ironic take and is a polar opposite on other art forms. Other art forms promote freedom of creativity, breaking out of conservatism. However, political arts are meant to control and throw over subversive ideas.  </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/7171470</p><br />

A distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means (electroacoustic music) and that produced using electronics only.[1] Electromechanical instruments have mechanical elements, such as strings, hammers and electric elements, such as magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, electric piano and the electric guitar, which are typically made loud enough for performers and audiences to hear with an instrument amplifier and speaker cabinet. Pure electronic instruments do not have vibrating strings, hammers or other sound-producing mechanisms. Devices such as the theremin, synthesizer and computer can produce electronic sounds.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>20th century is an era of varied musical styles.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>20th-century classical music describes art music that was written nominally from 1901 to 2000, inclusive. Musical style diverged during the 20th century as it never had previously. Consequently, this century was without a dominant style. Modernism, impressionism, and post-romanticism can all be traced to the decades before the turn of the century, but can be included because they evolved beyond the musical boundaries of the 19th-century styles that were part of the earlier common practice period. Neoclassicism and expressionism came mostly after 1900. Minimalism started much later in the century and can be seen as a change from the modern to post-modern era, although some date post-modernism from as early as ca. 1930. Aleatory, atonality, serialism, musique concrète, electronic music, and concept music were all developed during this century. Jazz and ethnic folk music became important influences on many composers during this century.</p><br />
