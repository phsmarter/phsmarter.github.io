                                            Read the following persuasive essay carefully. Encircle the verbs, box the adjectives, and underline the adverbs that express strong or pressing points. Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It has been discovered that most people who struggle with drug addiction began experimenting with drugs in their teens.  Teenage drug abuse is one of the largest problems in society today and the problem grows and larger every year.  Drugs are a pervasive force in our culture today.  To expect kids not to be influenced by the culture of their time is as unrealistic as believing in the tooth fairy (Bauman 140).  Teens may feel pressured by their friends to try drugs, they may have easy access to drugs, they may use drugs to rebel against their family or society, or they may take an illegal drug because they are curious about it or the pleasure that it gives them. After interviewing my teenage cousin whom has been in several altercations.</p><p>My teenage cousin advised me that after she passed the stage of being pressured by her peers to use drugs and alcohol, she began using it to make her feel better because she was suffering from depression.  Depression is the result of chemical imbalance and environmental influence.  Drugs and alcohol are the most readily available methods of emotional anesthesia, if not on hand; they would find a substitute (Henican 141).  She would use drugs when she would think about her incarcerated dad that has been in and out of her life from birth.  Her family members would try to encourage her and would often tell her, “If you continue to do the things that you are doing, you will end up like your dad incarcerated.”  She rebels against her mother and stepfather when they try to correct her and discipline her.  She doesn’t like to follow the rules at home or school and acts like she doesn’t do anything wrong.  Something psychologically is really going on with her mentally, that is one of the side effects that drugs causes.  Seeing there is no way out feeling lonely like no one cares and no prospects for improvement leads to depression.  Depression is something that many teens deal with during their lives.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Prevention can be broadly defined to encompass an array of noncoercive activities intended to prevent, reduce, or delay the occurrence of drug-taking or associated complications, such as clinical syndromes of drug dependence and threats to public safety. This chapter emphasizes nonlegal, noncoercive approaches to reducing drug use in populations that are not yet seriously involved with drugs. They include efforts to educate people about the consequences of substance use, to change their beliefs about the acceptability or utility of substance use, and to increase or make more salient the costs of substance use. We address what is known, what is not known, and what data and research are needed to increase useable knowledge about the effectiveness of a wide range of approaches.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>ESSAY ABOUT DRUG USE AND ABUSE TO ENCOUNTER:</strong></p><p></p><p>Drug abuse has a very broad impact. In a very small scope, namely oneself, it is known that drugs will cause various <strong>disturbances</strong> to the body's systems. These disturbances will interfere with the health of the user's body. If health problems have been found<strong> in high school students </strong>who are still young and have a bright future to serve the country and become good citizens.</p><p></p><p>In general, drugs can change the life of a high school student and lead him to bad things. A high school student should carry out his duties as a student by studying as much as he can and being active in various other youth activities. However, in fact, students who abuse drugs for recreational purposes cannot live life as they should. In addition, drugs also <strong>destroy a person</strong> from an economic point of view, regardless of age. </p><p></p><p><strong>Solution to Prevent or Avoid Drug Abuse</strong></p><p>The first solution that can be implemented and can be quickly applied to the wider community is <strong>public service advertisements</strong> in various media, such as cinema and social media. The reason for choosing cinema and social media as a means of spreading messages to prevent drugs is because these two media are media that, in the 21st century, are very much in demand by high school aged students.</p><p></p><p>There should be students who act as <strong>anti-drug ambassadors</strong> throughout the Philippines. Today, high school students are often friends in "exclusive" friendship groups. Thus, it is often difficult to influence such people, because they trust their friends more than experts. They trust the judgment of friends more than legally enforced law. Therefore, there needs to be representatives from each of these groups who are summoned to become representatives of anti-drug activists in their friendship groups.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about<strong> oral drugs</strong> here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/11682798</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

</p><p>
</p><p>You recognize that you cannot use drugs and alcohol like others and that you may need treatment and ongoing support to prevent relapse. Is it possible to prevent drug addiction altogether? Anything is possible, but if you are predisposed genetically to addiction your chances are greater for developing an addiction. This means that if drug or alcohol addiction runs in your family, then you too may be at risk.
</p><p>
</p><p>Society may try to prevent drug addiction through education. However, if you are already struggling with substance abuse then you may need treatment to prevent continued use and consequences. If you are looking at this page, you probably are questioning whether or not you have a problem with substances. In that case, you may need substance abuse treatment rather than trying to reverse the snowball of addiction.
</p><p>
</p><p>Steps to Prevent Drug Addiction
</p><p>
</p><p>The best tool against developing an addiction is avoiding drug or alcohol use in the first place. But that’s easier said than done. Many people begin using as young as age 13 and are too young to realize the damaging impact addiction will have on their lives. If you are lucky to have recognized the addiction pattern early, then follow these steps to prevent drug addiction.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Prevention is better than cure” is also true here. Tobacco, drugs/alcohol abuse are more during young age and during adolescence.</p><p>Thus remedial measures should be taken well in time. In this regard the parents and teachers have a special responsibility.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The following measures would be particularly useful for prevention and control of alcohol and drug abuse in adolescents.</p><p>1. Avoid undue Peer Pressure:</p><p>Every child has his/her own choice and personality, which should be kept in mind. So a child should not be pressed unduly to do beyond his/ her capacities, be it studies, sports etc.</p><p>2. Education and counselling:</p><p></p><p></p><p>Education and counselling are very important to face problems, stresses, disappointments and failure in life. These should be taken as part of life. One should utilize a child’s energy in some other activities like sports, music, reading, yoga and other extra curricular activities.</p><p>3. Seeking help from parents and peers:</p><p>Whenever, there is any problem, one should seek help and a guidance from parents and peers. Help should be taken from close and trusted friends. This would help young to share their feelings of anxiety and wrong doings.</p><p>4. Looking for Danger Signs:</p><p>If friends find someone using drugs or alcohol, they should bring this to the notice of parents of teacher so that appropriate measures would be taken to diagnose the illness and the causes. This would help in taking proper remedial steps or treatment.</p><p>5. Seeking Professional and Medical helps:</p><p>Highly qualified psychologists, psychia­trists and de-addiction and rehabilitation programmes can help individuals who are suffering from drug/alcohol abuse. If such help is provided to the affected persons, with sufficient efforts and will power, the patient could be completely cured and lead normal and healthy life.</p><p></p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Drugs are nothing but certain substances that make you addicted to them and change your lifestyle. The change that comes within your lifestyle is mostly negative. It is known to alter reality in such a way that you forget your roots and become prone to succumbing to your bad habits. The main change comes into your mental and physical wellbeing. This gives way to financial problems and negative effects on family and even professional relationships.</p><p></p><p>Drugs are not to be taken lightly as a problem. They are something that is often taken lightly and are taken within but is soon found to be irreparable mistakes. Drug use is mostly opted for when you are trying to cope up in a situation where you are emotionally tired and you feel that taking drugs would free you of the pain. This is the reason why most of the young generation falls prey to this demon.</p><p></p><p>Drug abuse is the most problematic cause of death in the world. Around 350,000 die from overdoses of smoking, drugs, and drinking as well. It is high time that we understand the seriousness of drug abuse and stay as far as possible from it.</p><br />

Help prevent teen drug abuse by talking to your teen about the consequences of using drugs and the importance of making healthy choices.Various factors can contribute to teen drug use and misuse.

                            21. Read the following persuasive essay carefully. Encircle the verbs, box the adjectives, and underline the adverbs that express strong or pressing points. Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</h2><br />
