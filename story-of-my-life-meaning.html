LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

Strong family ties and relationshipwas built - even Tiktok videos arewell-liked and performed by elders together with their children; the environment issmoothly recovering from pollution and breakage - pollution temporarily halted for amonth of locked down; most people cultivated the landeven pots and plasticcontainers were used to plant for future consumption. Discipline was instilled - mostlearned how to follow rules an seed how to wait and giveturns to others. Diligence inearning a living and finding means were made satisfied through online selling. HealthWas even worth thepricel - we are even encouraged to wash hands and eat vegetablesalways.Education had never stopped upon finding means - different learningmodalities are offered to us. Concerns and love to one another are fostered - givingand sharing were evident; andmost especially our faith and trust in God are restored.We are all taught to adjust ourselves in this New Normal life and everyone isincluded. And that's for our good to keep us safe fromharm and to stay alive.As I raised my head, I know that this is just a testof time. A period of everyone's life to be resilient, cared,hopeful, and prayerful. I believe that this pandemic willend the soonest and everything will just be a part of thehistory of human life.​what are the possible cause and effect in this story and possible solution</a>

                                            Sample Critique Lee, published by Crime Factory Posted in Short Story Reviews, tagged Cameron Ashley, Crime Factory, Eric Beetner, fiction, Lee Marvin, publishing, reading, short story. The Dirty Dozen, writing on May 28, 2013. I recently finished a fiction anthology called, Lee. The book features seventeen short stories, all written by crime writers, and inspired by Lee Marvin- his life, his movies. The stories flow in chronological order with the first taking place In 1944 and the last in 1987, just after Lee died. Frankly, I thought the concept was a little goffy, and I didn't really expect the book to be that good. I bought it only because its publisher, Crime Factory, had published two of my short stories. I like what they'd done in their journal, and figured I'd check out what else they've brought to the world.  &lt; I'm happy to admit that I was very wrong. Not only is every story in the collection really good, but it turns out that the concept really worked. In a word, the book rocks! It was fun to see how the different authors tackled the task of writing a Lee Marvin inspired story. I particularly liked the stories: "1966: JUST Swell," Cameron Ashley* *1967". The Gun Hunter. Eric Beetner. Beetner's novel The Devil doesn't Want Me has now moved up to number three on my reading list, which hopefully means I'll get to it in June. I feel good that in my own little way I'm associated with this writer, at least tangentially. Finishing Lee has also made me more interested in Lee Marvin's movies. I watched the man Who shot Liberty Valence during a film class in college and was blown away by his performance, but I don't think I seen another one of his movies. And I consider myself something of an old film buff. I took a step toward correcting this oversight last night by watching the Dirty Dozen- awesome! -CC Roy Jacob Posted by: Abdulat 8/10/2008 12:46 pmyung picture po yung sasagotan thank you po ​</a>

                                            It was sunday in the afternoon after we got to the beach we were at the church, i was so excited to swim since it has been moths that i haven’t go to the beach , so i change my formal dress off and change into my rashguard swimsuit then i met my cousins and my relative . After that we ate some lunch then I said to my cousin that we should go swimming. She said ok but we didn't know what was coming next . The level of the beach water was at our neck and there were waves but not that big . Then someone was approaching us. There were 6 boys , we were surrounded by them then they catcalled us .We couldn't do anything since they were bigger than us ….. We were really scared and on top of that they tried to touch me and my cousin . I also had to lie about where I live, but thank god I saw my sibling who is close to us, that was so that was the excuse to leave in that situation. I really don't know if i feel anger ,regret, grief or sadness i almost cried of what happened, I mean it has happened 2 times already but that kind of catcalling was the worst of them all. And after that i still can't have the courage to tell it to my family since it was my first time to be catcalled in the worst way . BASED ON A REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE FOR GIRLS LIKE USI'mma just give mah coins but pls read my story so everyone can be aware of being catcalled ​</a>

My classes started at seven o`clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health and the following year I was taken by my father to San Juan De Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to manila ans spoke to my Dominican professors who by this time, had become very fond of me and. told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer but could not pray for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpersin the University of Santo Tomas with eoom and board and free tuition. Thus I was able to take up the study of law."1.

While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his ricefield, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My andclasses started at seven o’clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.” 1.

A doctor entered the hospital in a hurry after being called in for an urgent surgery. He answered the call ASAP, changed his clothes &amp; went directly to the surgery block. He found the boy’s father pacing in the hall waiting for the doctor. On seeing him, the dad yelled: “Why did you take all this time to come? Don’t you know that my son’s life is in danger? Don’t you have any sense of responsibility?” The doctor smiled and said: “I am sorry, I wasn’t in the hospital and I came as fast as I could after receiving the call… And now, I wish you’d calm down so that I can do my work.” “Calm down? What if your son was in this room right now, would you calm down? If your own son dies now what will you do?” said the father angrily.           The doctor smiled again and replied: “… Doctors cannot prolong lives. Go and intercede for your son, we will do our best by God’s grace” “Giving advises when we’re not concerned is so easy,” murmured the father. The surgery took some hours after which the doctor went out happy, “Your son is saved!”. And without waiting for the father’s reply, he carried on his way running. “If you have any questions, ask the nurse!!” “Why is he so arrogant? He couldn’t wait some minutes so that I can ask about my son’s state,” commented the father when seeing the nurse minutes after the doctor left. The nurse answered, tears coming down her face: “His son died yesterday in a road accident, he was at the burial when we called him for your son’s surgery. And now that he saved your son’s life, he left running to finish his son’s burial.” PROCESSING QUESTIONS:  1.	What is your opinion about the attitude of the father in the story? 2.	What do you think is the best way response of the father in the story? 3.	If you are in the situation of the Doctor would you do the same things to his son.? 4.

LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

                            6. But in some way or another, the pandemic which caused sudden fallures anddisappointments in life and labor transforms the ordinary into an extraordinary renewalof what was lost. Strong family ties and relationshipwas built - even Tiktok videos arewell-liked and performed by elders together with their children; the environment issmoothly recovering from pollution and breakage - pollution temporarily halted for amonth of locked down; most people cultivated the landeven pots and plasticcontainers were used to plant for future consumption. Discipline was instilled - mostlearned how to follow rules an seed how to wait and giveturns to others. Diligence inearning a living and finding means were made satisfied through online selling. HealthWas even worth thepricel - we are even encouraged to wash hands and eat vegetablesalways.Education had never stopped upon finding means - different learningmodalities are offered to us. Concerns and love to one another are fostered - givingand sharing were evident; andmost especially our faith and trust in God are restored.We are all taught to adjust ourselves in this New Normal life and everyone isincluded. And that's for our good to keep us safe fromharm and to stay alive.As I raised my head, I know that this is just a testof time. A period of everyone's life to be resilient, cared,hopeful, and prayerful. I believe that this pandemic willend the soonest and everything will just be a part of thehistory of human life.​what are the possible cause and effect in this story and possible solution</h2><br />
                        <p>Cause - The animal influenza viruses such as SARS and Covid-19 that has emerges.  </p><p>Effect - it spreads all over the world to humans and animals which causes death. Everyone was been forced to just stay in their respective homes (quarantine) especially children and senior citizens that is more prone in virus. Because of quarantine, as the story says, strong family ties were built,the environment was smoothly recovering from pollution and breakage - pollution temporarily halted because of a month of lock down, Students were being taught through online or modules, and most importantly our faith and trust in God were restored.</p><p>Possible solution - Possible solution is to follow the rules that must be follow to prevent the spread of the virus like always wash hands, always drink water, take vitamins, eat proper foods, don't go outside if there is no important walk, always use mask and face shield when in the outside, social distance to people, and clean the surroundings. If You were exposed like  frontliners from their patients that is positive or when you are experiencing the symptoms, you have to do the 14 days quarantine rule or if possible go to the hospital if you cant handle it anymore. We also need to support each other and help others that are in need. We have to work together to fight the pandemic that was happening. Most importantly Prayers and Faith with God and Jesus Christ His Son.</p><br />

                            14. Sample Critique Lee, published by Crime Factory Posted in Short Story Reviews, tagged Cameron Ashley, Crime Factory, Eric Beetner, fiction, Lee Marvin, publishing, reading, short story. The Dirty Dozen, writing on May 28, 2013. I recently finished a fiction anthology called, Lee. The book features seventeen short stories, all written by crime writers, and inspired by Lee Marvin- his life, his movies. The stories flow in chronological order with the first taking place In 1944 and the last in 1987, just after Lee died. Frankly, I thought the concept was a little goffy, and I didn't really expect the book to be that good. I bought it only because its publisher, Crime Factory, had published two of my short stories. I like what they'd done in their journal, and figured I'd check out what else they've brought to the world.  &lt; I'm happy to admit that I was very wrong. Not only is every story in the collection really good, but it turns out that the concept really worked. In a word, the book rocks! It was fun to see how the different authors tackled the task of writing a Lee Marvin inspired story. I particularly liked the stories: "1966: JUST Swell," Cameron Ashley* *1967". The Gun Hunter. Eric Beetner. Beetner's novel The Devil doesn't Want Me has now moved up to number three on my reading list, which hopefully means I'll get to it in June. I feel good that in my own little way I'm associated with this writer, at least tangentially. Finishing Lee has also made me more interested in Lee Marvin's movies. I watched the man Who shot Liberty Valence during a film class in college and was blown away by his performance, but I don't think I seen another one of his movies. And I consider myself something of an old film buff. I took a step toward correcting this oversight last night by watching the Dirty Dozen- awesome! -CC Roy Jacob Posted by: Abdulat 8/10/2008 12:46 pmyung picture po yung sasagotan thank you po ​</h2><br />

It was sunday in the afternoon after we got to the beach we were at the church, i was so excited to swim since it has been moths that i haven’t go to the beach , so i change my formal dress off and change into my rashguard swimsuit then i met my cousins and my relative . After that we ate some lunch then I said to my cousin that we should go swimming. She said ok but we didn't know what was coming next . The level of the beach water was at our neck and there were waves but not that big . Then someone was approaching us. There were 6 boys , we were surrounded by them then they catcalled us .We couldn't do anything since they were bigger than us ….. We were really scared and on top of that they tried to touch me and my cousin . I also had to lie about where I live, but thank god I saw my sibling who is close to us, that was so that was the excuse to leave in that situation. I really don't know if i feel anger ,regret, grief or sadness i almost cried of what happened, I mean it has happened 2 times already but that kind of catcalling was the worst of them all. And after that i still can't have the courage to tell it to my family since it was my first time to be catcalled in the worst way . BASED ON A REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE FOR GIRLS LIKE USI'mma just give mah coins but pls read my story so everyone can be aware of being catcalled ​</h2><br />

A doctor entered the hospital in a hurry after being called in for an urgent surgery. He answered the call ASAP, changed his clothes &amp; went directly to the surgery block. He found the boy’s father pacing in the hall waiting for the doctor. On seeing him, the dad yelled: “Why did you take all this time to come? Don’t you know that my son’s life is in danger? Don’t you have any sense of responsibility?” The doctor smiled and said: “I am sorry, I wasn’t in the hospital and I came as fast as I could after receiving the call… And now, I wish you’d calm down so that I can do my work.” “Calm down? What if your son was in this room right now, would you calm down? If your own son dies now what will you do?” said the father angrily.           The doctor smiled again and replied: “… Doctors cannot prolong lives. Go and intercede for your son, we will do our best by God’s grace” “Giving advises when we’re not concerned is so easy,” murmured the father. The surgery took some hours after which the doctor went out happy, “Your son is saved!”. And without waiting for the father’s reply, he carried on his way running. “If you have any questions, ask the nurse!!” “Why is he so arrogant? He couldn’t wait some minutes so that I can ask about my son’s state,” commented the father when seeing the nurse minutes after the doctor left. The nurse answered, tears coming down her face: “His son died yesterday in a road accident, he was at the burial when we called him for your son’s surgery. And now that he saved your son’s life, he left running to finish his son’s burial.” PROCESSING QUESTIONS:  1.	What is your opinion about the attitude of the father in the story? 2.	What do you think is the best way response of the father in the story? 3.	If you are in the situation of the Doctor would you do the same things to his son.? 4.
