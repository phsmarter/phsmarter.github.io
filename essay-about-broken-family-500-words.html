                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>A broken family is a family that is not together and often has parents who are separated or divorced. It can be a difficult and challenging situation for children who have to navigate the complexities of a family that is no longer whole.</p><p></p><p>One of the most challenging aspects of a broken family is the feeling of loneliness. Children may feel alone, abandoned, or unloved, which can lead to feelings of sadness and depression. They may also feel angry, confused, and frustrated as they try to make sense of the changes happening around them.</p><p></p><p>In addition, a broken family can lead to financial difficulties, as one parent may be left to support the family on their own. This can lead to stress and strain on the family, as they struggle to make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>Despite these challenges, there are many positive things that can come out of a broken family. For example, children may become more independent and self-sufficient, as they learn to take care of themselves and their siblings. They may also develop strong bonds with other family members, such as grandparents or aunts and uncles.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, a broken family can be a difficult and challenging situation for children. However, with love, support, and perseverance, they can overcome these challenges and thrive.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>What the adjective words in the essay? </p><p></p><p>The adjectives used in the essay are:</p><p></p><p>difficult</p><p>challenging</p><p>whole</p><p>lonely</p><p>abandoned</p><p>unloved</p><p>sad</p><p>depressed</p><p>angry</p><p>confused</p><p>frustrated</p><p>positive</p><p>independent</p><p>self-sufficient</p><p>strong</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Family is one of the most important and influential aspects of our lives. It is the foundation of our personal growth, our socialization, and our support system. Family can be defined in many ways, but generally refers to a group of individuals who are related to each other by blood, marriage, or adoption. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of family and its impact on our lives.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>First and foremost, family provides us with a sense of belonging and identity. Our family is where we come from, and it shapes who we are as individuals. Family traditions, customs, and beliefs are passed down from generation to generation, and they help us to understand our heritage and where we fit in the world. Being part of a family gives us a sense of purpose and meaning, and it helps us to define our place in society.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Secondly, family plays a crucial role in our personal development. The love, care, and support that we receive from our family members are essential for our emotional and physical well-being. Family members are often the first people we turn to when we are in need of help, advice, or comfort. They are our role models and mentors, and they provide us with guidance and encouragement as we navigate through life's challenges.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In addition to providing us with emotional support, family also helps us to develop important social skills. Through interactions with family members, we learn how to communicate effectively, how to resolve conflicts, and how to build healthy relationships. We also learn the importance of responsibility, respect, and trust, which are essential qualities for success in both our personal and professional lives.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Family is also a source of strength and resilience during times of adversity. When faced with challenges such as illness, financial difficulties, or other crises, family members often come together to support each other and overcome these obstacles. The bonds of love and loyalty that exist within a family are powerful, and they can help us to overcome even the toughest of circumstances.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Lastly, family provides us with a sense of security and stability. It is a place where we can feel safe and protected, and where we can always turn to when we need help or support. This sense of security allows us to explore the world around us, take risks, and pursue our dreams and aspirations with confidence.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, family is a vital component of our lives, and it has a profound impact on our personal growth, socialization, and support system. It provides us with a sense of belonging and identity, helps us to develop important social skills, and offers us strength and resilience during times of adversity. It also provides us with a sense of security and stability, allowing us to pursue our goals and aspirations with confidence. Therefore, it is important to value and nurture the relationships within our families, and to recognize the many benefits that come with being part of a strong and supportive family unit.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Family is one of the most important aspects of our lives. It is where we find love, support, and a sense of belonging. A family is a group of people who are related to one another either by blood, marriage, or adoption. They share a common bond that transcends all other relationships.</p><p></p><p>The importance of family cannot be overstated. It is the first social institution that we encounter in our lives. The family provides us with a sense of identity and helps us develop a sense of belonging. It is through our family that we learn our values, beliefs, and customs. The family is also the primary source of emotional support and protection for us. When we face challenges or difficulties, our family is always there to help us overcome them.</p><p></p><p>Family relationships can take many forms. They can be nuclear, consisting of parents and their children, or they can be extended, including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. Regardless of the form, family relationships are based on love, trust, and mutual respect. Members of a family should support and care for each other, even in difficult times.</p><p></p><p>Families play a crucial role in the development of children. A healthy family environment helps children develop a positive self-image, learn social skills, and develop a sense of responsibility. Children who grow up in supportive and nurturing families are more likely to be successful in their personal and professional lives. They are also less likely to engage in risky behaviors such as drug use or crime.</p><p></p><p>However, families are not without their challenges. Conflicts, disagreements, and misunderstandings are common in family relationships. These challenges can sometimes lead to estrangement or a breakdown in communication. It is essential to work through these challenges and maintain open lines of communication within the family. Counseling or therapy can be helpful in resolving these issues.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, the definition of family has expanded. Same-sex couples, single-parent families, and blended families are becoming more common. These families face unique challenges but are no less valuable than traditional families. Love, support, and commitment are the foundation of all families, regardless of their structure.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, family is an essential aspect of our lives. It provides us with love, support, and a sense of belonging. Family relationships are based on mutual respect, trust, and care for one another. Families play a crucial role in the development of children and contribute to their success in life. Although families face challenges, it is important to work through them and maintain open lines of communication. All families are valuable, regardless of their structure, and should be celebrated and supported.</p><br />

My day is filled with many different tasks, both big and small, all of which are essential to the care and comfort of the person I am caring for.</p><p>My day usually starts very early, with me getting up before my loved one to prepare their breakfast and medications.

This includes making sure that their clothes are clean and ready to wear, their bed is made, and their room is tidy.</p><p>Once my loved one is up and dressed, I help them with any personal hygiene tasks they need assistance with, such as bathing or getting dressed.

MARAMING SALAMAT</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Being a caregiver is a challenging and rewarding job. It requires a lot of patience, compassion, and dedication. As a caregiver, my day starts early in the morning, and it is packed with various tasks that revolve around the needs of the people I take care of. My day usually starts with preparing breakfast for my clients. I make sure to follow their dietary requirements, and I always try to make their meals nutritious and appetizing. After breakfast, I assist them with their daily routines, such as brushing their teeth, bathing, and getting dressed. Depending on their health condition, some clients may need help with mobility, such as getting in and out of bed, or using a wheelchair. Throughout the day, I ensure that my clients take their medications on time, as prescribed by their doctor. I monitor their vital signs, such as blood pressure, pulse rate, and blood sugar level. I also keep track of any changes in their health conditions and report them to their healthcare providers. Aside from their physical needs, I also provide emotional support to my clients. I listen to their stories and concerns, and I try my best to be a good listener and a comforting presence. I engage them in activities that they enjoy, such as reading, watching movies, or playing games. These activities help them maintain their cognitive function and improve their mood. </p><p>As a caregiver, I also manage their household chores, such as cleaning, cooking, and doing laundry. These tasks may seem trivial, but they are crucial in maintaining a clean and healthy living environment for my clients. In the evening, I help my clients prepare for bed. I assist them with changing into their sleepwear, brushing their teeth, and getting into bed. Before I leave for the day, I make sure that they have everything they need within reach, such as water, medication, and their phone. Being a caregiver is not an easy job, but it is a fulfilling one. The satisfaction that I get from seeing my clients happy and healthy is immeasurable. As a caregiver, I am not just providing physical assistance, but I am also building relationships with my clients and their families. It is a privilege to be a part of their lives and to make a difference in their daily routines. </p><p>In conclusion, a day in my life as a caregiver is filled with various tasks that cater to the needs of my clients. From preparing their meals to managing their medications, I am always ready to provide the best care possible. It is a challenging job, but the rewards are priceless. I am grateful for the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of the people I take care of, and I hope to continue doing so for as long as I can.</p><br />

                        <p>The basic source of Philippine tax law is the National Internal Revenue Law, which codifies all tax provisions, the latest of which is embodied in Republic Act No. 8424 (“The Tax Reform Act of 1997”).  It amended previous national internal revenue codes, which was approved on December 11, 1997. A copy of the Tax Reform Act of 1997, which took effect on January 1, 1998, can be found here.The Philippines has entered into several tax treaties for the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to income taxes.  At present, there are 31 Philippine Tax Treaties in force.   Copies are available at the BIR Library and the International Tax Affairs Division of the BIR, which is under the Deputy Commissioner for Legal and Inspection Group.</p><p></p><p>The Philippine Treaty Series, edited and annotated by Haydee Yorac and published by Law Publishing House, University of the Philippines, is available in seven (7) volumes, covering the years 1944 to 1978 . The Philippine Treaty Index, by Benjamin Domingo, covers the years 1978 to 1982. A copy of the Philippine Treaty Index is available in the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Library. These publications contain treaties entered into by the Philippines. Tax privileges and exemptions granted under treaties to which the Philippines is a signatory are recognized under Philippine tax law.  Copies of treaties entered into by the Philippines with other countries and/or international organizations, from 1983 up to the present, are available at the DFA Library.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a post-secondary environment, academic expectations change from what you may have experienced in high school. The quantity of work you are expected to do is increased. When instructors expect you to read pages upon pages or study hours and hours for one particular course, managing your workload can be challenging. This chapter includes strategies for studying efficiently and managing your time.</p><p></p><p>The quality of the work you do also changes. It is not enough to understand course material and summarize it on an exam. You will also be expected to seriously engage with new ideas by reflecting on them, analyzing them, critiquing them, making connections, drawing conclusions, or finding new ways of thinking about a given subject. Educationally, you are moving into deeper waters. A good introductory writing course will help you swim.</p><br />

                            16. Write a 300 to 500 word essay about the status of democracy in the philippines.l​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The 2010 campaign has drawn to a close, and it’s time to distill my experiences after registering hundreds of miles by land, sea, and air crisscrossing the country as a party-list candidate.
</p><p>
</p><p>On the purely physical side, my shaking thousands of hands—I estimated some 3,500 in one two-hour period in the public market in Angeles, Pampanga—has apparently given my right arm a life of its own, like that of Dr. Strangelove or one of Jim Carrey’s characters. It twitches uncontrollably when not in action, as if waiting impatiently to be fed.
</p><p>There is no doubt in my mind that Philippine democracy is alive. Everywhere I went, there was intense interest in the candidates, particularly the presidential candidates, with many pausing from their labors to inquire which presidential nominee I favored and what program my party Akbayan had to offer. Everywhere the courtship of the voter was intense. Gone are the days when the “command vote” for a candidate could be considered sufficient to deliver victory. Except in the remotest places, the “market vote” has increased in both size and decisiveness. The market vote is no statistical abstraction for candidates: In almost every municipality and city, it has become de rigueur for candidates to present and sell themselves in the public market, trying to shake every hand within reach, even the wet hands of fish and meat vendors embarrassed to extend them.
</p><p>
</p><p>Most of the time, the cynics say, the people are at the mercy of the politicians. Maybe, but for at least three months every three years, the politicians are at the mercy of the voters.
</p><p>
</p><p>Philippine democracy is alive, but is it well?
</p><p>
</p><p>It is difficult to answer in the affirmative. The reason for this goes beyond the fact that come election day, scores will have been gunned down and huge sums will have been passed out to buy votes.
</p><p>
</p><p>What worries me, more than the violence and the vote-buying, of which we will always have a good dosage of, is the skyrocketing cost of elections. P9 billion is now said to be a conservative estimate for a presidential run, and P1.1 billion for somebody running for the Senate is said to be a low figure. For a candidate for Congress, P450 million is definitely on the low side. Most of these sums are spent on media outreach, particularly television. One is tempted to say the media is king. It might be more appropriate to say that the market is king, since it is the demand for advertising space, in a system where there are few legal constraints on electoral spending on media exposure, that raises its price many times over in the course of the 12-week election period.

Family is very important and valuable to me and is something that should never be taken for granted. “To me a family is whoever I can depend on for support, to laugh with, to play with, and to share the challenges and rewards of life with.” “Family means having someone to love you unconditionally in spite of you and your shortcomings. Family is loving and supporting one another even when it's not easy to do so.Freedom is the choice to live your life doing what you want, to live where you want, to eat by choice and to learn what your heart desires.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>  <strong>1        </strong><br />          The status of democracy in the Philippines is a complex and multifaceted issue. On one hand, the Philippines is a democratic country with regular elections, a free press, and a relatively active civil society. On the other hand, the country has a long history of corruption, political violence, and human rights abuses, which have undermined the integrity and effectiveness of its democratic institutions.</p><p></p><p>          One of the major challenges facing democracy in the Philippines is the concentration of power in the hands of a few elites. The country has a long history of oligarchic rule, with a small group of powerful families and businesses controlling much of the country's wealth and political power. This has led to widespread inequality and a lack of representation for the majority of Filipinos, particularly those in rural and marginalized communities.</p><p></p><p>          Another major challenge is the high level of corruption in the country. The Philippines ranks poorly on international measures of corruption, with high levels of both petty and grand corruption. This has led to a lack of trust in the government and democratic institutions, and has contributed to a sense of cynicism and disillusionment among the general public.</p><p></p><p>          Despite these challenges, there are also positive signs for democracy in the Philippines. The country has a vibrant civil society, with a strong tradition of advocacy and activism. There are also a number of strong democratic movements and organizations working to promote greater transparency, accountability, and participation in the political process.</p><p></p><p>          Overall, the status of democracy in the Philippines is mixed. While the country has made progress in building democratic institutions, there are still significant challenges to overcome in terms of inequality, corruption, and the concentration of power. However, with continued efforts by civil society and democratic movements, it is possible for the Philippines to continue to build a more inclusive and effective democracy.</p><p><strong>________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            22. essay about facemask 200- 300 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ON BEHALF of the physicians, nurses, and care teams at Mercy Health, we ask that you wear a mask when in public places to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, and perhaps even eliminate the disease from our community. This simple act can bring great benefit to many people.
</p><p>
</p><p>Wearing a mask can make all the difference for the people you love, your friends, neighbors, and our community. We have the ability to safeguard our older family members and protect those close to us who have underlying health issues. Wearing a mask can reduce threats to our community’s essential workers, including medical personnel, who’ve shown their commitment to our safety, health, and well-being. By wearing a mask and helping reduce the numbers of individuals who contract the disease, we can ensure fewer people will suffer serious, long-term effects that continue after recovery from the virus.  </p><p>Here are some guidelines for safeguarding yourself from the coronavirus: when wearing a face mask, be sure it fits properly, extending from the bridge of the nose to the chin, with no gaps along the sides. Wear a mask whenever you visit a public indoor space. When you’re outdoors and unable to maintain a safe social distance of at least 6 feet from other people, be sure to wear a mask.  </p><p>By combining frequent hand washing and social distancing with the use of a face mask, you are proactively safeguarding yourself, your family, friends, and neighbors from the virus. These are important steps that should be shared with those you know, including children ages 2 and older.  </p><p>Caregivers here in the Toledo region know the dangers posed by the coronavirus. We have cared for those who need help breathing in our hospitals. We have helped loved ones say good-bye to their family, sometimes the only way we can — through technology. We have watched as numbers ebb and flow for those who need emergent medical care. Health-care workers across the country have contracted this virus because they are on the front lines of this fight. We remain at a pivot point.  </p><p>The coronavirus remains a danger to all people. The Catholic Health Association, of which Mercy Health is a member, calls us to love thy neighbor by wearing a face mask. It is a safe, simple, and effective way of protecting everyone for the common good. And it shows respect and consideration for front-line workers, caregivers, and first responders.
</p><p>By wearing masks today, we’re working for a future in which our kids’ education is not compromised. One where grandparents can hug their grandkids again. A time when we can go on vacations without fear. The list of all we’ve given up because of the coronavirus is a long one. Together, we can slow the spread of the virus. For yourself, for those you love and all the people who are important in your life, all of us at Mercy Health ask that you wear a mask.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Please mark me brainliest if i'm correct thanks</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Being part of a broken family is something that many people live with, though a lot of the time, they don’t show it.</p><p>That one kid from class, a work-mate or even that cashier from your local Woolies could come from a broken family and you’d never even realise.</p><p></p><p>You learn from a young age that people are often insensitive, as most people don’t care about what’s going on at your home and often don’t acknowledge it if they don’t see it. While you’re not seeking any pity, a little consideration goes a long way. However, you go on to learn that if it doesn’t leave a physical mark, people often don’t care.</p><p></p><p>When you come from a broken family, it feels like you’re isolated and cut-off from the rest of the world. Being so distant to a parent or a sibling often pressures you into feeling like you need to deal with it by yourself. Why? Because it’s embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>It’s embarrassing because it feels like you’re the only one with a family who can’t seem to get along. It’s embarrassing because while everyone gets picked up by their parents, you’re left to hitching a ride or public transport.</p><p></p><p>It hurts. It hurts because it’s sometimes difficult to understand why your family is like this. Why you have to suffer while everyone else is so seemingly happy with their families. Why you hurt so badly when other families get along so well. Why it’s not your fault.</p><p></p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>#StaySafe</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Slowed academic development is another common way that separation of the parents affects children. The emotional stress of a divorce alone can be enough to stunt your child's academic progress, but the lifestyle changes and instability of a broken family can contribute to poor educational outcomes.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I was just six years old when my parents got divorced. When I tell people this, they are inclined to look at me with a melancholic expression and pity, but I always put a halt to it. I tell them that I was one of the fortunate few. My parents were civil to each other and my childhood was pretty decent.</p><p>I never considered either of my parents to be a single parent. Despite their divorce, they looked after me in unison. My time was divided amongst both of them. Half of the year, I resided at my father’s residence and the other half at my mother’s apartment. Their houses were just a ten minute drive from each other so I was never far away from either of them. Every Saturday night, we would have dinner together and there was no hostility. My parents were always present together to celebrate my birthdays, special festivals like Eid and important moments of my life like volleyball final matches, graduations and the list goes on. Even though, they were divorced, I had a functional life. </p><p>It seemed like my parents had figured out how to be divorced and still make sure I was not scarred by it. I had believed that I had been untouched by the horrible…show more content…</p><p>There have been many moments when instead of aiming to better my relationship with my husband, I was just avoiding conflict because deep inside, I believe conflict will eventually lead to divorce. The other day, my husband decided to invest our money from the joint account in a new construction venture even though I had told him not to. When I asked him about it, he listed the reasons as to why he believed strongly in the venture and could not let me make a mistake. After arguing a bit more, I stopped and said, “I guess you are right” with a big sigh. </p><br />
