                                            Teachings of Jesus in His Sermon on the Mount A. Do not store up treasure for yourself here on earth where moth and rust destroy it and where thieves can steal it. Store up treasure for yourself with God, where no moth or rust can destroy, nor thief come and steal it. B. No one can serve two masters; for he will either hate one and love the other, or he will be loyal to the first and look down on the second. You cannot at the same time serve God and money. C. This is why I tell you not to be worried about food and drink for yourself or about clothes for your body. Is not life more important than food and is not the body more important than clothes? D. Fortunate you are, when people insult you and persecute you and speak all kinds of evil against you because you are my followers. Be glad and joyful, for a great reward is kept for you in God. This is how these people persecuted the prophets who lived before you. E. Set your heart first on the kingdom and justice of God and all these things will be given to you. ​</a>

                                            TEXT #2: The article below written by Amy Alkon will inform you on how she viewed the beauty of an individual. Read and understand the text and determine Alkon's prejudice towards how people feel about improving their physical appearance. Write an essay explaining how prejudice is evident in the text. Men's looks matter to heterosexual women only somewhat. Most women prefer men who are taller than they are, with symmetrical features (a sign that potential is healthy and parasite-free). But, women across cultures are intent on finding male partners with high status, power, and access to resources-which means a really short guy can add maybe a foot to his height with a private jet. And, just like women who aren't very attractive, men who make very little money or are chronically out of work tend to have a really hard time finding partners. There is some male grumbling about this. Yet, while feminist journalists deforest North America publishing articles urging women to bow out of the beauty arms race and 7 "Learn to love that woman in the mirror!", nobody gets into the ridiculous position of advising men to "Learn to love that unemployed guy sprawled on the couch!" Now, before you brand me a traitor to my gender, let me say that I'm all for women having the vote, and I think a woman with a mustache should make the same money as a man with a mustache. But you don't help that woman by advising her, "No need to wax that lip fringe or work off that beer belly!" (Because the road to female empowerment is...looking just like a hairy old man?) pagawa namn po reporting napi kase nmin huhu gagawa lng po ng easy about that na gagawing  prejudice​</a>

The butter |make I will take to market, and with the money I get for it I will buy a lot of eggs forhatching. How nice it will be when they are all hatched, and the yard is full of fine youngchicks. Then when May day comes I will sell them, and with the money I'll buy a lovelynew dress to wear to the fair. All the young men will look at me. They will come andtry to impress me, but I shall very quickly send them about their business!"As she thought of how she would settle that matter, she tossed her headscornfully, and down fell the pail of milk to the ground.

He usually gets about 300-500 pesos a month by recycling most of his rubbish. It is not a lot of money but he is happy to have a little extra income. Most of the time he uses the money to take his wife to the cinema. His wife is always looking forward in going to cinema every end of the month. Sam has always been careful with his money and teaches his children the importance of money and how to protect the environment by recycling.Questions:1. What does Sam want to people do?2. How much does he earn?3. what does he recycle?4. What does he do with the money?5. What does Sam teaches to his children?​</a>

Read and understand the text and determine Alkon's prejudice towards how people feel about improving their physical appearance. Write an essay explaining how prejudice is evident in the text. Men's looks matter to heterosexual women only somewhat. Most women prefer men who are taller than they are, with symmetrical features (a sign that potential is healthy and parasite-free). But, women across cultures are intent on finding male partners with high status, power, and access to resources-which means a really short guy can add maybe a foot to his height with a private jet. And, just like women who aren't very attractive, men who make very little money or are chronically out of work tend to have a really hard time finding partners. There is some male grumbling about this. Yet, while feminist journalists deforest North America publishing articles urging women to bow out of the beauty arms race and 7 "Learn to love that woman in the mirror!", nobody gets into the ridiculous position of advising men to "Learn to love that unemployed guy sprawled on the couch!" Now, before you brand me a traitor to my gender, let me say that I'm all for women having the vote, and I think a woman with a mustache should make the same money as a man with a mustache. But you don't help that woman by advising her, "No need to wax that lip fringe or work off that beer belly!" (Because the road to female empowerment is...looking just like a hairy old man?) pagawa namn po reporting napi kase nmin huhu gagawa lng po ng easy about that na gagawing  prejudice​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The article by Amy Alkon titled "Men's Looks Matter Less to Women Than You Think" discusses the preferences of heterosexual women when it comes to physical appearance in men. Alkon suggests that women prefer men who are taller than them with symmetrical features, indicating good health and lack of parasites. However, the author notes that women place a greater emphasis on a potential partner's status, power, and access to resources than their physical appearance. The article also highlights the challenges faced by men who have low income or are chronically unemployed in finding partners.</p><p></p><p>Prejudice is evident in the text as the author appears to hold biased views against women who do not conform to societal beauty standards. Alkon criticizes feminist journalists who encourage women to embrace their natural appearance and not participate in the "beauty arms race." She argues that advising women to "Learn to love that woman in the mirror!" is ridiculous and suggests that women need to remove their mustache or work off their beer belly to achieve empowerment. This indicates a prejudice towards women who do not conform to traditional beauty standards.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the author shows a biased attitude towards men who are chronically unemployed or make very little money. Alkon suggests that men who are in this position have a difficult time finding partners, and nobody advises them to "Learn to love that unemployed guy sprawled on the couch!" This statement implies that men who are not financially successful do not deserve love or respect, which is a prejudiced view.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Amy Alkon's article exhibits prejudice towards individuals who do not conform to traditional beauty standards and those who are not financially successful. The author's opinions suggest that societal norms regarding beauty and wealth are more important than individual worth and contribute to harmful attitudes towards marginalized individuals.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa brainlist po </p><br />

                        1. Wisdom, Passion, Solitude<p>Wisdom — it empowers humans' soul</p><p>Passion — depicts your motivation towards a           specific knowledge and/or goal</p><p>Solitude — it allows an individual to captivate his/her inner thoughts</p><p></p><p>2. Evolution and Creation are two things that dislikes each other. In my opinion though, I reckon in evolution. There are so many evidences out there that soothes the idea of evolution—consider "fossils" for example. There is a link between our species and these ancient fossils that lived ages from now, which utterly depicts the idea of evolution itself.</p><p></p><p>3. Humans are evolving sluggishly, in that sense it's quite complicated for us "humans" to be able to sustain the capacity of our brains to make instantaneous change towards the things that we do the most. Exploring is big deal for us, but even though we've got the knowledge; the technology to do so. We will not be able to explore the universe and unveil it's most frustrating and darkest secrets that will only coexist in a curious mind of a homo sapiens.</p><p></p><p>4.
