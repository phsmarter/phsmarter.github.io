                            3. What is the relationship of the physical characteristic of the region to its natural resources?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> Location: Position on Earth's Surface
</p><p>Absolute and relative location are two ways of describing the positions and 
</p><p>distribution of people and places on the earth's surface.
</p><p>Absolute location answers the questions: Where is it?
</p><p>Absolute location is nothing more than a simple dot--often identified as a grid 
</p><p>coordinate on the surface of the earth. Latitude and longitude can be used to 
</p><p>pinpoint a location. For example, the absolute location of New Orleans, 
</p><p>Louisiana, is 30 degrees north, 90 degrees west. Finding absolute location is 
</p><p>the starting point for geographic research.
</p><p>Relative location is the relationship of a place to other places.
</p><p>For example, New Orleans is located at the place where the Mississippi River
</p><p>empties into the Gulf of Mexico, which gives it easy access to ocean and river
</p><p>shipping. Your home has a relative location. Where is it located in relation to
</p><p>schools, stores, and convenient transportation?
</p><p>Location is only one piece of the framework of geography, yet it is an important
</p><p>theme because it helps us know and express where things are.
</p><p>Discuss answers to these questions about your location: • What are the latitude and longitude coordinates of your absolute location. • What is your relative location and the relationship of your location to other
</p><p>locations? • How does the importance of your location change over time?
</p><p>II. Place: Physical and Human Characteristics
</p><p>The theme of place addresses this question: What's it like there? This theme
</p><p>considers the characteristics that make one place different from all other places on earth.
</p><p>Geographers describe a place by two kinds of characteristics; physical and human.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. INJURYUnintentional or intentional damage to the body resulting from acute exposure to thermal, mechanical, electrical, or chemical energy or from the absence of such essentials as heat or oxygen. Injuries can be further classified based on the events and behaviors that precede them as well as the intent of the persons involved. At the broadest level, injuries are classified as either violence or unintentional injuries.
</p><p>2. INTENTIONAL INJURY ARE INJURIES RESULTING FROM VIOLENCE.
</p><p>3. SELF INFLICTED WHEN A PERSON HARMS HIMSELF/HERSELF ON PURPOSE
</p><p>4.  SUICIDE the intentional taking of one’s own life. Many of those who attempt suicide do not receive mental and emotional counselling because their families try to hide the problem because they are ashamed of it. Because of this, the problem is not solved and the attempt to commit suicide can be repeated.
</p><p>5.  PARASUICIDE a suicide attempt in which a person does not intend to die. It is often a cry for help, meaning, the person wants others to know what she/he is feeling. Despite this, parasuicide should be taken seriously because it may also lead to death.
</p><p>6. ASSAULT WHEN PERSON/PERSONS HARM ANOTHER ON PURPOSE
</p><p>7. COMMITTED WITHIN THE FAMILY  DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - an act that includes physical assault, sexual abuse and verbal abuse. There are some children who experience domestic violence in their homes. Their parents may think that their children do not know about the violence, but most of the time, the children are aware of it. They can feel helpless, scared and upset. Some of them blame themselves as they feel like the violence is their fault

</strong></p><p><strong>Natural resources have a double-edge effect on economic growth, in that the intensity of its use raises output, but increases its depletion rate. Natural resource is a key input in the production process that stimulates economic growth.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Physical characteristics include the natural environment, such as landforms, elevation, water features, climate, soil, natural vegetation, and animal life. ... Human characteristics also include the built environment, such as houses, roads, and other infrastructure.</p><p>
</p><p>Resources characteristics: Resources have three main characteristics namely 1) Utility, 2) Limited availability, 3) Potential for depletion or consumption. Scarcity is the fundamental economic problem of having humans who have unlimited wants and needs in a world of limited resources.
</p><p>Any natural substance that humans use can be considered a natural resource. ... Natural resources are used to make food, fuel and raw materials for the production of goods. All of the food that people eat comes from plants or animals. Natural resources such as coal, natural gas and oil provide heat, light and power.atural resources, both renewable and non-renewable, and ecosystem services are a part of the real wealth of nations. They are the natural capital out of which other forms of capital are made. They contribute towards fiscal revenue, income, and poverty reduction.</p><p>Physical characteristics include land forms, climate, soil, and natural vegetation. For example, the peaks and valleys of the Rocky Mountains form a physical region. Some regions are distinguished by human characteristics. These may include economic, social, political, and cultural characteristics.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Vulnerability and Risk</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>What is Vulnerability</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Vulnerability describes the characteristics and circumstances of a community, system or asset that make it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard. There are many aspects of vulnerability, arising from various physical, social, economic, and environmental factors. Examples may include:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>poor design and construction of buildings,  </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>inadequate protection of assets,</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>lack of public information and awareness,</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>limited official recognition of risks and preparedness measures, and</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>disregard for wise environmental management.  </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Vulnerability varies significantly within a community and over time. This definition identifies vulnerability as a characteristic of the element of interest (community, system or asset) which is independent of its exposure. However, in common use the word is often used more broadly to include the element’s exposure.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The above explanation was taken from the United Nations (UN) International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) Terminology on Disaster Risk Reduction. Follow the link to look up other terminologies.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>There are four (4) main types of vulnerability:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1. Physical Vulnerability may be determined by aspects such as population density levels, remoteness of a settlement, the site, design and materials used for critical infrastructure and for housing (UNISDR).</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Example: Wooden homes are less likely to collapse in an earthquake, but are more vulnerable to fire.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>2. Social Vulnerability refers to the inability of people, organizations and societies to withstand adverse impacts to hazards due to characteristics inherent in social interactions, institutions and systems of cultural values. It is linked to the level of well being of individuals, communities and society. It includes aspects related to levels of literacy and education, the existence of peace and security, access to basic human rights, systems of good governance, social equity, positive traditional values, customs and ideological beliefs and overall collective organizational systems (UNISDR).</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Example: When flooding occurs some citizens, such as children, elderly and differently-able, may be unable to protect themselves or evacuate if necessary.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3. Economic Vulnerability. The level of vulnerability is highly dependent upon the economic status of individuals, communities and nations The poor are usually more vulnerable to disasters because they lack the resources to build sturdy structures and put other engineering measures in place to protect themselves from being negatively impacted by disasters.  </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Example: Poorer families may live in squatter settlements because they cannot afford to live in safer (more expensive) areas.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>4. Environmental Vulnerability. Natural resource depletion and resource degradation are key aspects of environmental vulnerability.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Example: Wetlands, such as the Caroni Swamp, are sensitive to increasing salinity from sea water, and pollution from stormwater runoff containing agricultural chemicals, eroded soils, etc.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>What is Risk</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Risk (or more specifically, disaster risk) is the potential disaster losses (in terms of lives, health status, livelihoods, assets and services) which could occur to a particular community or a society over some specified future time period. (Reference UNISDR Terminology)</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>It considers the probability of harmful consequences, or expected losses (deaths, injuries, property, livelihoods, economic activity disrupted or environmentally damaged) resulting from interactions between natural or human induced hazards and vulnerable conditions.  </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Risk can be calculated using the following equation: Risk = Probability of Hazard x Degree of Vulnerability.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>There are different ways of dealing with risk, such as:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Risk Acceptance: an informed decision to accept the possible consequences and likelihood of a particular risk.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Risk Avoidance: an informed decision to avoid involvement in activities leading to risk realization.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Risk Reduction refers to the application of appropriate techniques to reduce the likelihood of risk occurrence and its consequences.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Risk Transfer involves shifting of the burden of risk to another party. One of the most common forms of risk transfer is Insurance.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The Need for Assessments</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Before steps can be taken to reduce risk and vulnerability, they must first be understood. Vulnerability assessments and risk analyses allow for the identification of areas of critical concern and help to guide mitigation efforts. There are a variety of methods by which these assessments can be conducted and organizations such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have even developed their own tools to aid this process:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Threat/Vulnerability Assessments and Risk Analysis - Whole Building Design Guide</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Risk and Vulnerability Assessment Tool</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Community Vulnerability Assessment Tool</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The principal natural resource is freshwater. Living between the coast and the mountains is good. In some regions, snow and ice collect on the mountains and form a natural hoard of freshwater that will be released in Spring. In other areas, mild weather can provide a steady supply of freshwater.</p><p>The second natural resource is arable land. Erosion breaks down rocky ground into soil. Volcanic soil is particularly good. Of course sunshine is good too - temperate regions tend to be favourable for production.</p><p>Sana po makatulong</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Infants, children, and youth are an important part of our community, and there are many people, services, and physical resources that can help them thrive. For example, pediatricians, child psychologists, and other healthcare professionals work tirelessly to ensure that children stay healthy and strong. They often form long-lasting relationships with families, providing personalized care and advice that can make a real difference in a child's life.</p><p></p><p>In addition, many community organizations and programs work to support children and youth. Sports teams, after-school clubs, and mentorship programs can provide a sense of belonging and help children develop important social skills. Schools, libraries, and other educational resources offer opportunities for children to learn and grow, expanding their knowledge and building their confidence.</p><p></p><p>Access to safe and healthy environments is also crucial for children's development. This includes access to clean water, nutritious food, and safe living spaces. Community services such as childcare services, food banks, and shelters can help families in need, ensuring that children have access to the basic necessities they need to thrive.</p><p></p><p>Above all, the love and support of families and caregivers are essential for children's well-being. Positive parenting practices and nurturing environments can help children develop resilience and emotional well-being. By working together to support and invest in these people, services, and physical resources, we can create a community that prioritizes the well-being and flourishing of our youngest members.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>8. Nutrition plays a critical role in physical fitness by providing the body with the energy and nutrients needed to support exercise and recovery. To optimize your diet for fitness, focus on consuming a balanced mix of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats. Aim to consume nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Additionally, stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day and before, during, and after exercise. It may also be helpful to work with a registered dietitian or certified nutrition coach to develop a personalized nutrition plan that meets your unique fitness goals and needs.</p><p></p><p>9. Cultural, social, and economic factors can all impact physical activity and fitness levels in different populations. For example, cultural norms may discourage certain types of physical activity, social factors such as time constraints may limit opportunities for exercise, and economic factors may limit access to fitness resources. Strategies to promote more equitable access to fitness resources could include offering affordable fitness options, providing education on the benefits of physical activity, and addressing cultural and social barriers through community outreach and engagement programs.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

The Challenge of Initiative: As stated earlier, no one on this planet can survive without doing activities. So, the first challenge to performing an activity is the challenge of initiative. When we are assigned an activity, we must start doing it. Without our initiative, the activity will remain pending; it will lead us to trouble. We must overcome all type of procrastination and do the activity.</p><p>2.       The Challenge of Knowledge: The second most important challenge is the challenge of knowing how to do an activity. If we have the knowledge, we will easily do it. However, if we lack knowledge, we will keep postponing it.  So, we must overcome this challenge of knowledge.</p><p>3.       The Challenge of Right Attitude: If we have the right attitude to the activity or life in general, we will be able to do the activity in time and efficiently. Poor, irresponsible, and careless attitude will keep the completion of activity pending.</p><p>4.       The Challenges of Resources: In order to perform an activity successfully, we must also have all the resources to perform that activity. For example, if we want to climb Mt. Everest, we should not only have the expertise, knowledge, willingness, training, and motivation, but enough resources such as money and equipment also.</p><p>5.        Apart from the above mentioned challenges, we must also overcome the challenges of poor focus, lackadaisical approach, mediocrity, complacence, etc.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>p</strong></p><p></p><br />
