                                            Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Socialization is the process of learning and adapting to the norms, values, and customs of a particular society or group. The processes involved in socialization include:</p><p></p><p>a. Enculturation: The process of learning one's own culture and internalizing the values, beliefs, and behaviors of that culture.</p><p></p><p>b. Social learning: Learning from the observation and interaction with others in society, such as parents, siblings, peers, and teachers.</p><p></p><p>c. Role-taking: The ability to put oneself in another person's position and understand their point of view. This involves taking on different roles and understanding the expectations and responsibilities associated with those roles.</p><p></p><p>The nature of influence that comes from socialization is profound, as it shapes an individual's attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Socialization influences how individuals interact with others, make decisions, and view the world around them.</p><p></p><p>2. The key agents of socialization in the development of a child are:</p><p></p><p>a. Family: Parents and other family members provide the first and most influential socialization experiences for a child.</p><p></p><p>b. Peers: As children grow older, peers become increasingly important agents of socialization. Children learn from their peers about social norms, values, and behaviors.</p><p></p><p>c. Teachers: Teachers play a crucial role in the socialization of children, as they provide guidance and instruction on how to behave in the classroom and in society.</p><p></p><p>d. Community: The community in which a child lives can also play a role in socialization, as children learn from the norms and values of their community.</p><p></p><p>3. Socialization with family, teachers, peers, and community can result in various individual attributes and characteristics. For example:</p><p></p><p>a. Family socialization can result in a child developing a sense of identity, values, and beliefs that are reflective of their family's culture and traditions.</p><p></p><p>b. Socialization with teachers can result in a child developing a sense of discipline, responsibility, and respect for authority figures.</p><p></p><p>c. Socialization with peers can result in a child developing social skills, such as communication and cooperation, as well as a sense of belonging and identity within their peer group.</p><p></p><p>d. Socialization with the community can result in a child developing an understanding of social norms and values, as well as a sense of civic responsibility and community engagement.</p><p></p><p>Overall, socialization is a critical process that shapes an individual's development, values, and behavior. It is a lifelong process that occurs through various agents and experiences, and it is important to be aware of the influences and impacts of socialization in order to understand and navigate one's social environment.</p><p><strong>MARK ME BRAINLIEST!</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Socialization is the process by which individuals learn and internalize the values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors of their society. It involves several processes, including:</p><p></p><p>Observational Learning: Individuals learn by observing the behaviors of others and the consequences of those behaviors.</p><p>Modeling: Individuals imitate the behavior of those they observe and respect.</p><p>Reinforcement: Individuals learn through reinforcement of behaviors that are desirable in their society.</p><p>Conditioning: Individuals learn through a process of conditioning, whereby they associate certain behaviors with specific consequences.</p><p>Communication: Individuals learn through communication with others, including verbal and nonverbal communication.</p><p></p><p>2. The influence that comes from socialization is significant and long-lasting. Socialization shapes an individual's personality, attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors. It provides individuals with a sense of social identity, and it helps them to understand their place in society.</p><p></p><p>3. The key agents of socialization in the development of a child are:</p><p>Family: Parents and other family members are the first and most influential agents of socialization in a child's life.</p><p>School: Teachers and peers are important agents of socialization in a child's life, as they provide opportunities for social interaction and learning.</p><p>Community: Community institutions, such as places of worship, clubs, and organizations, also play a role in socializing children.</p><p>4. Socialization with family, teachers, peers, and community can result in various individual attributes and characteristics, such as: Social skills: Children who have positive socialization experiences tend to develop good social skills, such as communication, cooperation, and empathy.</p><p>Self-esteem: Children who have positive socialization experiences tend to develop high self-esteem and a sense of self-worth.</p><p>Cultural identity: Socialization helps individuals develop a sense of cultural identity, which contributes to their overall sense of identity and belonging.</p><p>Emotional development: Socialization can contribute to emotional development, including the ability to regulate emotions and cope with stress.</p><p>Moral development: Socialization helps individuals develop a sense of morality and ethical behavior.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

What are the processes involved in socialization? 2. What is the nature of influence that comes from socialization? 3.  Who are the key agents of socialization in the development of a child? 4. What individual attributes and characteristics can result from socialization with family, teachers, peers, and community?​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. In my opinion, socialization involves a series of processes through which individuals learn and internalize the norms, values, beliefs, and behaviors of their society. These processes include:</p><p></p><p>a) Primary Socialization: This process occurs in early childhood and involves the acquisition of basic social skills, language, and cultural norms from parents or primary caregivers.</p><p></p><p>b) Secondary Socialization: This process occurs throughout life and involves learning and adapting to the norms and values of different social groups, such as schools, workplaces, and religious institutions.</p><p></p><p>c) Anticipatory Socialization: This process occurs when individuals prepare for future roles and statuses by adopting the behaviors, attitudes, and values associated with those roles. For example, a student preparing for a professional career may engage in internships or apprenticeships to learn the expectations of that profession.</p><p></p><p>d) Resocialization: This process occurs when individuals undergo a significant change in their social environment, leading to a reevaluation and restructuring of their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Examples include transitioning from military to civilian life or from prison to society.</p><p></p><p>2. The nature of influence that comes from socialization is multi-faceted and powerful. Socialization shapes our identity, beliefs, values, attitudes, and behaviors by providing us with a framework for understanding and participating in society.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Socialization is the process through which individuals acquire the knowledge, skills, values, and behaviors that are necessary to participate effectively in their society. It is a lifelong process that begins at birth and continues throughout an individual's life. There are several processes involved in socialization, including:</p><p>a) Primary socialization: This occurs during early childhood and is primarily influenced by the family. It involves the acquisition of basic skills such as language, self-care, and social norms from parents or caregivers.</p><p></p><p>b) Secondary socialization: This takes place during later childhood and adolescence and is influenced by other agents of socialization such as schools, peers, and media. It involves learning more complex social skills, cultural norms, and values from sources outside of the family.</p><p></p><p>c) Anticipatory socialization: This occurs when individuals learn and adopt behaviors, values, and roles that are associated with a future social status or role they aspire to, such as preparing for a career or becoming a parent.</p><p></p><p>The nature of influence that comes from socialization is multifaceted. Socialization shapes an individual's identity, self-concept, beliefs, values, and behaviors. It helps individuals internalize societal norms, values, and expectations, and guides their interactions with others. Socialization also plays a significant role in the development of social bonds, cultural identity, and the formation of one's personality.</p><p></p><p>2.The key agents of socialization in the development of a child are:</p><p>a) Family: Family is the primary agent of socialization, and it is where children first learn social norms, values, and basic skills. Parents, siblings, and other family members transmit cultural, religious, and societal values to children and shape their early socialization experiences.</p><p></p><p>b) Schools: Schools are important agents of socialization as they provide formal education, social interaction with peers, and exposure to various cultural norms and values. Teachers and classmates play a significant role in shaping a child's beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors.</p><p></p><p>c) Peers: Peers, including friends, classmates, and playmates, also play a crucial role in socialization. Peer influence can shape a child's behavior, values, and attitudes towards social norms and cultural practices.</p><p></p><p>d) Community: The community, including neighborhoods, religious institutions, and other community organizations, also influences a child's socialization. Community values, traditions, and norms can shape a child's identity and sense of belonging.</p><p></p><p>3.Socialization with family, teachers, peers, and the community can result in various individual attributes and characteristics, including:</p><p>a) Cultural identity: Socialization influences an individual's sense of cultural identity, including their language, beliefs, customs, and traditions. It shapes their cultural values, norms, and practices, which can impact their behavior and attitudes towards others.</p><p></p><p>b) Personality traits: Socialization experiences can shape an individual's personality traits, such as extroversion, introversion, openness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability. These traits can affect an individual's behavior and interactions with others.</p><p></p><p>c) Social skills: Socialization agents, such as family, schools, and peers, play a crucial role in developing an individual's social skills, including communication, conflict resolution, and cooperation. These skills are important for successful social interactions in various settings.</p><p></p><p>d) Gender roles: Socialization influences the development of gender roles and expectations, including attitudes and behaviors associated with femininity and masculinity. These roles can impact an individual's beliefs, behaviors, and choices throughout their life.</p><p></p><p>e) Moral values: Socialization plays a significant role in the development of an individual's moral values and ethical beliefs. Family, schools, and other agents of socialization help individuals internalize societal norms and values related to right and wrong, which can guide their decision-making and behavior.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>paki brainliest po thank u &lt;3<br />

                            4. Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?
