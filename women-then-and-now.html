                            15. What are the roles of men and women before versus now​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The roles of men and women now are equal unlike the past.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The roles of men and women in the past are different from the roles that we have today. Men in the past are expected to be working outside to support the family financially and mostly doesn't do housework. Men now can do housework (househusbands). Women in the past are likely to stay in the house and do all the housework. Women today are now working outside while their partners stay in the house. Men in the past are taught to be tough and not cry so they can't show any weakness unlike the men today are can cry because crying is not a weakness but are emotions. Women in the past cannot or are not allowed to be a leader because of gender inequality but women today can even become a president of a country. But whatever the reasons are, i can say that i like the roles of men and women now than their roles in the past</p><br />

                        things have changed. Today, women are senior rabbis in pulpits that once would not hire women. Most synagogues have women wardens, and women serving in all capacities of leadership. Non-gender specific, inclusive language is enshrined in our newer liturgies, and men as well as women find it liberating. Women perform every mitzvah available in many synagogues. And study passages in siddurim reflect this wider perspective.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Yes, in my opinion women still suffer from gender inequality up until now although it is less intense that how it use to be. For example, parents not wanting their daughters to have boyfriends for they are afraid it might get pregnant. I think it should be their sons who need to learn something. Another thing is the contraceptive pills, I hope they invented it for men. They can impregnant ladies everyday and women can only get pregnant once in 9 months which means guys produce more child than women in comparison. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sign In</p><p></p><p>Gender</p><p>7 Leadership Lessons Men Can Learn from Women</p><p>by Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic and Cindy Gallop</p><p>April 01, 2020</p><p></p><p>Although there is a great deal of public interest in ensuring more women become leaders, thereby reversing their under-representation in the ranks of power, too many suggested solutions are founded on the misconception that women ought to emulate men. The thinking is: “If men have most of the top roles, they must be doing something right, so why not get women to act like them?”</p><p></p><p>But this logic fails to account for the relatively dismal performance of most leaders — who are overwhelmingly male. As we have argued before, the real problem is not a lack of competent females; it is too few obstacles for incompetent males, which explains the surplus of overconfident, narcissistic, and unethical people in charge.</p><p></p><p>As a consequence, gender differences in leadership effectiveness (what it takes to perform well) are out of sync with gender differences in leadership emergence (what it takes to make it to the top). Indeed, research shows that the prevalence of male senior leaders is not a product of superior leadership talent in men. Rather, large quantitative studies, including meta-analyses, indicate that gender differences in leadership talent are either nonexistent, or they actually favor women.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, it would be more logical to flip the suggested remedy: instead of encouraging women to act like male leaders (many of whom are incompetent), we should be asking men in power to adopt some of the more effective leadership behaviors more commonly found in women. This would create a pool of better role models who could pave the way for both competent men and women to advance.</p><br />

                        It’s a real pleasure to be here today to celebrate International Women’s Day, happy International Women’s Day everybody, it is really an important date in the calendar – and I think it is important that we pause and reflect on that.<br /><br />First and foremost it’s an opportunity to recognise how much progress has been made, let’s not deny women today have opportunities today that our mothers grandmothers could only have dreamed of – so we must celebrate that and this is an important opportunity to do so.<br /><br />But it’s also an opportunity to recognise how much more progress we need to make until we live in a society where gender equality is something that we take for granted as a reality. Until there can be as many mediocre women in the same positions as men, until it’s not the case, that women as we do today, so often have to work twice as hard just to be considered half as good as our male counterparts.<br /><br />And I’m as conscious, even in my position, of the progress that we still have to make, as any other woman. I’m the First Minister of Scotland, the most senior politician in the country, yet the world I live and work in is still predominantly male.<br /><br />It’s a world where male culture still dominates, a world where the treatment that is dished out to women on a daily basis, the criteria that we are judged by, leads to a very different experience for women, than the experience for men.<br /><br />So this is a day where I think it is important to rededicate ourselves, not just as women, but to encourage our male allies to rededicate themselves for the battle for true gender equality. The day I became First Minister I made a speech in the Scottish Parliament and I talked then about my then, eight year old niece who is now 12 going on 26.<br /><br />But I spoke about my desire, and this can apply to all of us, that the world I want her to grow up as a woman in is a world which consigns to history the gender pay gap, where systemic under representation of women is a thing of the past, and where the deep-seated misogyny, that, let us be honest still exists in our society, and where you do not have to go very far in to the murky realms of social media to find it, where that is also a thing of the past.<br /><br />Let’s rededicate ourselves to that here on International Women’s Day. It is great to join all of you today for this very, very special event – an important opportunity to celebrate, to highlight and to promote the role of women generally, but in particular, the role of women in business. And I know that is something that Business Gateway Edinburgh does on a<br /><br />on a day-today basis and we saw a good example of that this morning – with the launch of Women in Business Growth Programme – a fantastic initiative that I warmly welcome and thoroughly endorse.<br /><br />That’s a programme targeted at women who have the ambition to grow their businesses. As part of the programme, they will have the opportunity to attend expert workshops, receive tailored support from Business Gateway Edinburgh and the aim is to give female entrepreneurs the knowledge they need – to better understand the business landscape, to develop new contacts and explore new markets.<br /><br />And that’s just one more way in which Business Gateway Edinburgh is looking to support women-led businesses – and promote entrepreneurship generally.<br /><br />Link: https://www.gov.scot/publications/women-in-business-first-ministers-international-womens-day-speech/ (hope it's correct, correct me if I'm wrong)<br />
