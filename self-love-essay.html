                                            Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

                                            Hello I will be sending little parts of my essay for people to correct, I want it to be perfect for my teacher to understand why they are so important to me.
All my life I have loved doing many things, but only a few amazing things have turned into big goals that have made me the person I am today.
	One of these amazing goals is in TKD. I have enjoyed doing TKD since I was in the kinder garden. I enjoy TKD because it has taught me honesty, integrity, perseverance, self-control, an indomitable spirit, and most importantly confidence. The dojang has taught me self-defense obviously, and I have stuck to it for many years. It is important to me because the people there have kept me going. Also, it is a very fun sport to do. With all of this information, I think you can conclude that this sport is very important to me. Since you probably understand now why I picked this sport. Even though I am very good and have my black belt, my journey will not stop there. I want to continue helping at the dojang, And go up in ranks. That is my current goal for TKD for now.</a>

                                            Hello, I will be sending parts of my essay for people to correct. Would want it to be perfect for my teacher to understand why they are so important to me.
All my life I have loved doing many things, but only a few amazing things have turned into big goals. That has made me the person I am today.
	One of these goals is in TKD. I have enjoyed doing TKD since I was in the kinder garden. I enjoy TKD because it has taught me honesty, integrity, perseverance, self-control, an indomitable spirit, and most importantly, confidence. The dojang has taught me self-defense, and I have stuck to it for many years. It is important to me because the people there have kept me going. Also, it is a fun sport to do. With all of this information, you can conclude that this sport is important to me. Since you probably understand now why I picked this sport. Even though I am very good and have my black belt, my journey will not stop there. I want to continue helping at the dojang, And go up in ranks. That is my current goal for TKD for now.</a>

Seventeenth-century images emphasized the title character’s pompous folly as well as the often rough-and-tumble action of many episodes.

The first representation of the scene appears in a Frankfurt edition of 1648, in which the windmill sail stabs Don Quixote.

In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag and off I went to collect my friends by way of bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. 
THE writer presented what point of view?

Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be.
What narrative device was used in the paragraph?
The correct answer is: Flashback

Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.

                            6. Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Introduction:<p>In her essay "Respect Begets Respect", Aruna Ladva emphasizes the importance of giving respect to all individuals, regardless of their actions, because every person is worthy of respect simply because they exist.</p><p></p>Body:<p>The author argues that respect is an innate quality that we possess, and we should not have to make an effort to give it. However, it is crucial to have self-respect before giving respect to others. Self-respect helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others and to build our sense of self from the inside. The author also notes that when we love and respect ourselves, we can see the beauty and specialties of others, making it easier to give respect and create harmony.</p><p></p>Idea 1:<p>According to the author, respect is not only for those who deserve it but for everyone. To give respect to all individuals, even those who do not measure up to our standards, is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect reflects more on us than the person in front of us. Waiting for others to become deserving or withholding respect until we feel they are worthy deprives us of exercising this quality, which is a valuable treasure.</p><p></p>Idea 2:<p>The author suggests that we are beings of love and that we should not seek love, approval, or regard from others because we already possess it within ourselves. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others. A person with self-respect understands that comparing or competing with others is futile and nonsensical. Comparing and competing are symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p></p>Idea 3:<p>Lastly, the author believes that each one of us came onto this earth to share a particular quality with the world. Therefore, it is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others, even when it is not readily apparent. Giving respect to others is a way of exercising and multiplying our quality of respect, which will inevitably earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Conclusion:<p>In conclusion, giving respect to all individuals is crucial, and it is an innate quality that we possess. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others, and it helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others. By looking for the beauty and specialties in others, we can exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will naturally earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Reflection:<p>After reading the essay, I learned that respect is not something that we have to earn but something that we should give freely to all individuals. Self-respect is crucial because it forms the foundation for giving respect to others. Comparing and competing with others are futile and nonsensical, and they stem from a fragile, inflated ego. It is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others to exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will earn us respect from others naturally.</p><p></p><p></p><strong>#</strong><strong>CarryOnLearning</strong><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><br />

I am also an ordinary individual who wants nothing but a better lifestyle for everyone in the next few days.</p><p></p><p>In the year 2010, face masks and face shields were not introduced. We only go outside just to enjoy life and do the usual things we are fond of doing. No community quarantines and distance between two or more individuals are not observed. We only want what makes everyone happy.  We do not have all the strict compliance and rules every time we go outside.  But we are in a different situation now.</p><p></p><p>From 2019 until now, one of the main questions students ask is “How long will this online class take?”</p><p></p><p>This has been one of the most important questions that students nowadays are asking. Public parks are now open where kids and adults can go. Churches are also serving the public and welcome visitors of any age. Public malls, which accommodate thousands of shoppers and guests every day, are also open. Why are schools still not ready to accept students?</p><p></p><p>The COVID-19 crisis has surprisingly changed the way people live and work. Aside from these, students are also adjusting to the new normal style of teaching just to be globally competitive when it comes to providing quality education. It has also caused a dramatic disruption in the delivery of education. The closures of schools and limited techniques to teach students to challenge our country’s literacy rate.</p><p></p><p>During the pandemic, new teaching styles and blended learning which are combinations of two or more methods have been introduced. The pandemic’s negative effect on the educational system is evident as the World Bank reports that Philippine education is disturbing for the year 2021. July 2021, the Malacañang palace expressed alarm over the World Bank report that over 80% of Filipino students fall below the minimum proficiency levels.</p><p></p><p>With the educational crisis our nation is facing, what are the other long-term negative effects will it bring? Will we still deal with the blended learning style or should we shift again to the face-to-face method?</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>You're Welcome&lt;//3</p><br />

                            22. informative essay about Why Self-Love is Key to Personal Growth and Happiness"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>nn</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Self-love refers to the act of accepting, valuing, and caring for oneself. It is a fundamental aspect of personal growth and happiness, as it enables individuals to feel more confident and satisfied with themselves and their lives. In this essay, we will explore the importance of self-love and how it can contribute to personal growth and happiness.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, self-love is essential for personal growth. When individuals love themselves, they are more likely to take care of themselves and prioritize their needs. This can include engaging in self-care activities, setting boundaries, and pursuing their passions and interests. By doing so, individuals can develop a stronger sense of identity and purpose, which can lead to a greater sense of fulfillment and happiness.</p><p></p><p>Self-love also plays a critical role in building resilience and coping with life's challenges. When individuals love themselves, they are more likely to be kind and compassionate to themselves when they make mistakes or experience setbacks. Rather than getting stuck in negative self-talk or self-blame, individuals with self-love are more likely to see these experiences as opportunities for growth and learning. As a result, they can bounce back more quickly and effectively from difficult situations.</p><p></p><p>In addition to personal growth, self-love is also a key component of happiness. Research has consistently shown that individuals with higher levels of self-esteem and self-worth are more likely to experience greater levels of happiness and life satisfaction. This is because self-love allows individuals to feel more comfortable in their own skin, accept their flaws and imperfections, and focus on their strengths and positive qualities.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>B. Self-Love:</strong></p><p></p><p>Loving yourself provides you with self-confidence, self-worth, and in general, you feel more positive. If you can learn to love yourself, you will feel happier and will learn to take better care of yourself.</p><p></p><p>Looking in the mirror, most of us see a lot of different flaws and remember too many past experiences and failings to love ourselves. The less you love yourself, listen to yourself, and understand yourself, the more confused, upset, and frustrated you will be in life. When you begin to love yourself and continue to love yourself more and more each day, things slowly will be a little bit better in every way possible.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, self-love isn’t always easy. </p><p></p><p>Accepting the pain and allowing yourself to be honest with who you are is a big step to loving yourself. Forgive yourself for past actions and things you are ashamed of doing.</p><p></p><p>Carrying a lot of negative emotions like jealousy, disgust, and rage can have a negative impact. We need to learn how to accept not only the emotions that create love, joy, and happiness but also the ones that cause fear, insecurity, and anger in our lives.</p><p></p><p>While we need to learn how to acknowledge and accept the pain with the love, another step is reconciling with a cold and unopened heart. Asking yourself if you fully love yourself can be very difficult because you must accept your flaws and faults.</p><p></p><p>Love is something we choose, the same way we choose anger, hate, or sadness. We have the power to forgive someone who has hurt us in the past. We can learn to finally heal from something when we can forgive. We can always choose love.</p><p></p><p>Learning to love yourself leads to better self-care. Examples of this could be taking a break from time to time and accepting that no one is perfect and things happen.</p><p></p><p>Another example could be saying no to others when you really don’t have the time or energy to say yes. We often do too much for other people because we want to please everyone. We can forget to look after ourselves and then we become overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>Today is the day you can love yourself completely with no expectations. Making the choice right now to choose your own love is the most powerful healing force you have.</p><p></p><p>Hope it helps...</p><br />

                            30. Refer to the given paragraph below, entitled “Picturing Don Quixote”: 
Seventeenth-century images emphasized the title character’s pompous folly as well as the often rough-and-tumble action of many episodes. The windmill scene, in which Don Quixote mistakes the technology that grinds the grain produced in the semi-arid Manchegan landscape for giants, became immediately iconic. The first representation of the scene appears in a Frankfurt edition of 1648, in which the windmill sail stabs Don Quixote.

In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag and off I went to collect my friends by way of bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. 
THE writer presented what point of view?

Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be.
What narrative device was used in the paragraph?
The correct answer is: Flashback
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.
