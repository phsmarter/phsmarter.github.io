                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Food,Water,Electricity,and shelter</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>1. What are needs?</strong></p><p></p><p>A need is something that is necessary for an organism to live a healthy life. Needs are distinguished from wants. ... In other words, a need is something required for a safe, stable and healthy life (e.g. air, water, food, land, shelter) while a want is a desire, wish or aspiration.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Differentiate needs from wants and wants from</strong><strong> </strong><strong>demands.</strong></p><p></p><p>In short, needs are things that satisfy the basic requirement. Wants are requests directed to specific types of items. Demands are requests for specific products that the buyer is willing to and able to pay for. In a consumer market examples are usually very clear to identify.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. What are the basic needs of</strong><strong> </strong><strong>man?</strong></p><p></p><p>Human beings have three basic needs: food, water and shelter. Two of these needs - food and shelter - are often met in some way by plants and animals.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Why are they called</strong><strong> </strong><strong>basic?</strong></p><p></p><p>Food, water, clothing, sanitation, education, healthcare and shelter are the basic needs of human. It called basic because it endeavors to characterize the outright least assets fundamental for long-term physical well-being, more often than not in terms of utilization of goods.</p><p></p><p><strong>5. Differentiate product from</strong><strong> </strong><strong>service.</strong></p><p></p><p>Products are tangible – they are physical in nature such that they can be touched, smelled, felt and even seen. Services are intangible and they can only be felt not seen. Need vs. Relationship– a product is specifically designed to satisfy the needs and wants of the customers and can be carried away.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>6. What are the physiological needs or basic needs? Give</strong><strong> </strong><strong>examples.</strong></p><p></p><p>Physiological needs: The first of the id-driven lower needs on Maslow's hierarchy are physiological needs. These most basic human survival needs include food and water, sufficient rest, clothing and shelter, overall health, and reproduction.</p><p></p><p><strong>7. What are security needs? Give</strong><strong> </strong><strong>examples.</strong></p><p></p><p>These security needs are important for survival, but they are not as important as the basic physiological needs. Examples of safety and security needs: safety, shelter, security, law &amp; order, employment, health, stability, etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>8. What are social needs?</strong></p><p></p><p>Social Needs: Belongingness, love, affection, intimacy, family, friends, relationships, etc. Esteem Needs: self-esteem, self-confidence, achievement, recognition, status, respect, etc. Cognitive needs: knowledge, meaning, understanding, etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>Hope</strong><strong> it</strong><strong> helps</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>.</strong></p><br />

                        <p>1. A need is something that is necessary for an organism to live a healthy life. Needs are distinguished from wants. ... In other words, a need is something required for a safe, stable and healthy life (e.g. air, water, food, land, shelter) while a want is a desire, wish or aspiration.</p><p></p><p>2. A need is something that is needed to survive. A want is something that an individual desires, but would be able to live without. A primary distinguishing feature of aneed is that it is necessary to sustain life. </p><p>Wants are requests directed to specific types of items. Demands are requests for specific products that the buyer is willing to and able to pay for. In a consumer market examples are usually very clear to identify. A person might have a need for reliable transportation.</p><p></p><p>3. Human beings have certain basic needs. We must have food, water, air, and shelter to survive.</p><p></p><p>4. If any one of these basic needs is not met, then humans cannot survive.</p><p></p><p>5. A product is a tangible item that is put on the market for acquisition, attention, or consumption, while a serviceis an intangible item, which arises from the output of one or more individuals. ... In most cases services are intangible, but products are not always tangible.</p><p></p><p>6. Physiological needs - these are biologicalrequirements for human survival, e.g. air, food, drink, shelter, clothing, warmth, sex, sleep. ... Maslow considered physiological needs the most important as all the otherneeds become secondary until these needsare met.</p><p>Physiological needs - these are biological requirements for human survival, e.g. air, food, drink, shelter, clothing, warmth, sex, sleep.</p><p></p><p>7. Safety and security needs are about keeping us safe from harm. These needs include shelter, job security, health, and safe environments. If a person does not feel safe in an environment, they will seek to find safety before they attempt to meet any higher level needs.</p><p></p><p>8. Social needs refer to the need to have relationships with others once the physiological and safety needs have been fulfilled. Maslow considered the social stage an important part of psychological development because our relationships with others help reduce emotional concerns such as depression or anxiety.</p><br />
