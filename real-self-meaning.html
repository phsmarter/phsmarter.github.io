                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In this passage, Aristotle's ethical system of "self realization" is introduced. This system involves a person acting in accordance with their nature and reaching their full potential in order to achieve contentment and do good. A baby is seen as a potential person who needs to realize their inherent potential to avoid frustration and failed goals. Happiness is the ultimate goal, and civic life or wealth are only seen as means to achieve self-realization. It is believed that developing one's talents and awareness of one's nature are crucial for attaining happiness.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
