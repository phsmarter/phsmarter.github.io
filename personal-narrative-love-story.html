And three, the letter is asking for some explanation of the untoward happenings here on planet Earth. Lastly, the letter will not be mailed but will be placed on the altar for the angels to carry to Jesus. Amazingly different in three ways, the letter holds the greatest message of all time-the message of love and justice, of brotherhood, and sisterhood. (Castillo, K.E. (2016).

What examples, reasons, or facts are presented to validate the generalization? What words or phrases introduce them? Remember that generalizations are like "big umbrellas." A summary restates only the main points of a text without giving examples or details such as dates, numbers or statistics. When you summarize, you keep in mind the answers to the (5) Wh's and How questions. Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text type. There are two main text types, factual and literary. Factual text types include factual description, recount, or persuasive. Literary text types include poetry, narrative or personal response. One of its kind is the narrative text. It is a type of literary text that tells a story. It presents series of events which can either be fiction or non-fiction. Fiction narrative may include picture books, cartoons, fantasy, adventure, science fiction, fairy tales, legends, fables or plays. Non-fiction narratives include autobiography, biography, memoir, diary and others. The basic elements of narrative include the theme, setting, characters and plot. Theme refers to the author's message about life or human nature he or she tries to convey in the story. The setting answers the when and where the story happens and the characters are the people, animals or things playing an important role for the events. The plot consists of the episodes happened from beginning, middle and ending events.please. po pasagot</a>

                                            Narrative 2: ―We are in a different war with COVID-19. This is not like ISIS where we can see the enemy,said Dr. Alicia Macmac, rural health unit officer in Lumba Bayabao, Lanao Del Sur. The impact of the Marawi City siege in 2017, an armed conflict between Philippine government forces and ISIL-affiliated militants, aggravated the poverty situation in Lanao del Sur, which is the poorest province in the country. More than 17,000 Maranao people displaced by the conflict remain in temporary shelters in the province. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased their vulnerability on top of the ongoing humanitarian situation. Dr. Macmac and other health care workers face enormous pressure to stop COVID-19 infections. As government-run hospitals face shortages of critical supplies to help contain the spread of the virus, UNICEF is providing disinfection supplies, tents, personal protective equipment, and infection prevention and control training for community health workers, sanitary engineers, and inspectors. 1.

                        <p><strong>RELATIONSHIPS</strong></p><p></p><p>Title: "What if We Had Never Met?"</p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>Have you ever thought about how different your life might be if you had never met a certain person? In this narrative essay, we will explore the hypothetical scenario of a relationship never coming to be, and the potential consequences of that missed connection.</p><p></p><p>Beginning of the story:</p><p></p><p>It was a typical Friday night when we first crossed paths. I was out with some friends at a local bar, trying to forget about a recent breakup, when I saw him across the room. Our eyes met, and it was like everything else around us disappeared. We spent the rest of the night talking and laughing, and I knew that this was the beginning of something special.</p><p></p><p>Middle Events:</p><p></p><p>Over the next few months, our relationship blossomed. We went on adventures together, explored new places, and spent countless hours getting to know each other. We were inseparable, and I couldn't imagine my life without him.</p><p></p><p>But then, one day, everything changed. I received a job offer in another state, and I knew that I had to take it. We talked about it and decided that we would make it work, even though we would be long distance. But as the days went by, the distance between us seemed to grow. We started to drift apart, and eventually, we decided to break up.</p><p></p><p>Ending of the story:</p><p></p><p>I moved away and started my new job, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. I tried to move on and focus on my career, but I couldn't help but think about what could have been. I often found myself wondering, "What if we had never met?"</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In the end, I realized that our relationship was just one of many possible paths that my life could have taken. But even though things didn't work out between us, I will always be grateful for the time we spent together. Our relationship may have been brief, but it was filled with love, laughter, and countless memories. And who knows, maybe one day our paths will cross again and we can pick up where we left off. Until then, I will always cherish the time we had together.</p><p></p><p><strong>EDUCATION</strong></p><p></p><p>Title: The Power of Education: A What-If Scenario</p><p></p><p>Introduction: Education has always been a crucial aspect of human life. It has the power to shape our minds, broaden our horizons, and open up opportunities for us. But what if we did not have access to education? How would our lives be different? This is the question we aim to explore in this narrative essay.</p><p></p><p>Beginning of the story: Imagine a world where education was not considered important. Children were not encouraged to go to school, and those who did were often ridiculed for their efforts. In this world, the pursuit of knowledge was seen as a waste of time and resources.</p><p></p><p>Middle Events: As a result of this lack of emphasis on education, many people struggled to find jobs and make a decent living. They were trapped in a cycle of poverty and had little hope of breaking free. Those who did manage to secure jobs often had to settle for low-paying, unskilled positions.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, without access to education, many people were unable to learn the skills needed to adapt to a rapidly changing world. As technology advanced, they were left behind, unable to compete in the job market or even keep up with the world around them.</p><p></p><p>Ending of the story: Eventually, the lack of education began to take a toll on society. Crime rates increased, and people became more isolated and unhappy. The economy struggled, and the overall quality of life declined. It was clear that the absence of education had severely impacted the world in a negative way.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion: In conclusion, education is a powerful tool that has the ability to shape our lives for the better. Without it, we would be unable to compete in a rapidly changing world and would be more likely to face poverty, isolation, and unhappiness. It is crucial that we prioritize education and provide access to it for all individuals.</p><p></p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p></p><p>Greetings, mortal.

Two, it is a letter addressed to Jesus Christ who is not a common person, relative, friend, or acquaintance. Jesus, for the Christians, is the Son of Mary. And three, the letter is asking for some explanation of the untoward happenings here on planet Earth. Lastly, the letter will not be mailed but will be placed on the altar for the angels to carry to Jesus. Amazingly different in three ways, the letter holds the greatest message of all time-the message of love and justice, of brotherhood, and sisterhood. (Castillo, K.E. (2016).

What examples, reasons, or facts are presented to validate the generalization? What words or phrases introduce them? Remember that generalizations are like "big umbrellas." A summary restates only the main points of a text without giving examples or details such as dates, numbers or statistics. When you summarize, you keep in mind the answers to the (5) Wh's and How questions. Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text type. There are two main text types, factual and literary. Factual text types include factual description, recount, or persuasive. Literary text types include poetry, narrative or personal response. One of its kind is the narrative text. It is a type of literary text that tells a story. It presents series of events which can either be fiction or non-fiction. Fiction narrative may include picture books, cartoons, fantasy, adventure, science fiction, fairy tales, legends, fables or plays. Non-fiction narratives include autobiography, biography, memoir, diary and others. The basic elements of narrative include the theme, setting, characters and plot. Theme refers to the author's message about life or human nature he or she tries to convey in the story. The setting answers the when and where the story happens and the characters are the people, animals or things playing an important role for the events. The plot consists of the episodes happened from beginning, middle and ending events.please. po pasagot</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a literary work, film, or other narrative, the plot is the sequence of events where each affects the next one through the principle of cause-and-effect.

Plots can vary from the simple—such as in a traditional ballad—to forming complex interwoven structures, with each part sometimes referred to as a subplot or imbroglio.</p><p></p><br />

                            22. Narrative 2: ―We are in a different war with COVID-19. This is not like ISIS where we can see the enemy,said Dr. Alicia Macmac, rural health unit officer in Lumba Bayabao, Lanao Del Sur. The impact of the Marawi City siege in 2017, an armed conflict between Philippine government forces and ISIL-affiliated militants, aggravated the poverty situation in Lanao del Sur, which is the poorest province in the country. More than 17,000 Maranao people displaced by the conflict remain in temporary shelters in the province. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased their vulnerability on top of the ongoing humanitarian situation. Dr. Macmac and other health care workers face enormous pressure to stop COVID-19 infections. As government-run hospitals face shortages of critical supplies to help contain the spread of the virus, UNICEF is providing disinfection supplies, tents, personal protective equipment, and infection prevention and control training for community health workers, sanitary engineers, and inspectors. 1.
