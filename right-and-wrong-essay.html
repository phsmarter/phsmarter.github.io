                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>it is our last and best judgment concerning what’s right and wrong, the tradition says that a conscience judgment binds us to obedience, not by chains, but by the force of the moral “ought.”  The ought binds us because in the end it is a judgement on ourselves: if I do what I judge I ought not to do (or vice versa), then I am willing to be an evil-doer.</p><p></p><p>Conscience Is “Supreme”</p><p></p><p>It is in this  sense that the tradition, following Aquinas, says that “conscience is supreme:” because in the last analysis, if I wish to be a good person, I must follow what I believe to be right and flee from what I believe to be evil; and that judgment comes from conscience.</p><p></p><p>This is even the case when my conscience is in error, because under the circumstances I don’t know I’m in error, and hence think my judgment is correct.  Therefore, to oppose my judgment would be, as far as I’m concerned, to do what I judge to be wrong, and this is always wrong, even if my judgment, because of a mistaken conscience, is wrong.  Blessed John Henry Newman writes:</p><p></p><p>If a man is culpable in being in error, which he might have escaped, had he been more in earnest, for that error he is answerable to God, but still he must act according to that error, while he is in it, because he in full sincerity thinks the error to be truth</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Welcome </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Self-Accountability</strong> comes to my mind. Making your own decisions makes you <strong>responsible</strong> for what comes out of that decision whether it was a positive move or not. Making your own decisions also allows you to make your own mistakes and learn from them. If you’ve ever had someone try to tell you not to do something without a better reason than, “I said so or it didn’t work” it’s not really a good enough reason not to do it. An argument for this way of thinking is that the choice is not in your hands, and so you don’t get to see what will happen if you do the same thing.</p><p></p><p>This is why advice is not considered a command. Someone can advise you on something, but usually there is an actual reason they give for why they state their position, you can do what you want with the information.</p><p></p><p>Obviously there are things you should avoid doing for reasons of safety and the laws we have set in our respective societies but, that doesn’t mean you can’t do the— just that you shouldn’t because there is a consequence involved. Self-accountability though is an important factor in how your life progresses. when you make choices, you make the choice to represent those choices if something happens as a result, this is something you don’t get a choice of.</p><p></p><p>If you choose to let others make the decision for you, you can have the illusion of not feeling responsible for what someone told you to do if you do it. Mistakes and choices exist for this reason so giving it away gives that away as well.</p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. "The eyes eat first" is a saying that emphasizes how presentation plays a significant role in our perception of food. This means that the way food is presented on the plate, its presentation, colors, and arrangement, influence how we perceive its flavor and quality, and can even affect our appetite. </p><p></p><p>2. "Cooking is a science; plating is an art" highlights the difference between the technical aspects of cooking, such as measurements and temperatures, and the artistic aspects of presentation. While cooking requires precision and adherence to specific techniques, plating involves creativity and aesthetic appeal. A well-plated dish can elevate a meal from good to exceptional. </p><p></p><p>In addition, it is essential to keep in mind that balance and taste are crucial in plating. Food should be arranged in a way that is visually appealing but also allows the diner to enjoy all the components of a dish together. The serving size should be appropriate, and the energy gained from the meal should not be disproportionate. Presentation should not override the taste of the food.</p><p></p><br />
