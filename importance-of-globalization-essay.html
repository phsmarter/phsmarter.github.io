It is concerned with health issues that transcend national borders or have the potential to impact the world’s economies and political climates.</p><p></p><p>Global health as a concept looks ahead so that nations can work together to prepare for possible problems.</p><p></p><p>In the case of COVID-19, the disease spread rapidly across the globe and many nations reached the brink of recession. However, that pandemic is just one example of numerous scenarios that, if not addressed, could threaten lives around the world. Global health emphasizes prevention at the population level and is vital to helping maintain global security. Global health is important because it aims to improve worldwide health, access to health care services and the quality of health care for all.</p><p></p><p>Global health considers several determinants, or factors, that influence health status. The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion lists several examples, including diet and physical fitness, lack of health care access, exposure to toxic substances and compliance with health and safety regulations. Though disruptions to global health can affect any nation, developing nations are more vulnerable because of their weaker socioeconomic infrastructures.</p><p></p><p>By analyzing a community’s personal, social, economic and environmental determinants, health experts can then promote wellness in a targeted fashion as well as help minimize the effects of diseases in that community. This in turn leads to a stronger economy, as fewer illnesses occur and productivity is not negatively impacted.</p><p></p><p>I hope my answer helped you. </p><p></p><p>-Alyannahqtzy</p><p></p><br />

                            3. write a short essay about the importance of global health??​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>the real point of global health, which is constantly brought up and then buried under the drumbeat of the aforementioned short-sightedness is how global health is an overall economic boon for all of us.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day we live in an ever shrinking complex society where what adversely affects others, sooner or later adversely affects us.</p><p></p><p>It is not for love of man that insurance companies so quickly boarded the preventive health train to cover well visits. And it is all about profit that major corporations invest millions of dollars in including wellness programs to their employees.</p><p></p><p>Illness has a personal cost to the individual and his or her family, but also an economic cost to the rest of us. It affects productivity at work, crime rates, and safety net costs.</p><p></p><p>Emergency rooms as a first line of defense against illness is an absurd allocation of resources. Doctors, nurses, and hospitals don’t work for free. So guess who is paying for all that unnecessary care?</p><p></p><p>And if you are healthy you are a contributor in so many other ways. My personal medical costs turned out to reach heights I might otherwise have thought extraordinary. Hundreds of thousands of dollars most years, millions over time. At a young age, when our children were in grammar and pre-school, my life was saved through extraordinary means and through the efforts of extraordinary people (I have not yet had the opportunity to detail this episode in my medical odyssey as my blog, lifeunderthecloud.com, is quite new and with all the demanding, newer adventures in medicine I have not yet had the opportunity to adequately chronicle it but promise to as soon as I can).</p><p></p><p>My children, now in their thirties have grown to be successful, loving contributors to society. I can’t say they would have turned out any different had I not had the medical resources available that I did, and passed a quarter century ago.

The song uses powerful words and phrases such as "likas na yaman" (natural resources), "kalikasan" (nature), and "ating mundo" (our world), to emphasize the importance of preserving our environment. These words and phrases remind us that the environment is a precious resource that we need to protect and conserve for future generations.</p><p></p><p>In light of the current issue of global environmental degradation, the message of "Kapaligiran" becomes even more relevant. The rapid growth of industrialization and economic globalization has brought about significant environmental problems such as climate change, deforestation, and pollution. The need for sustainable development has become more urgent than ever before. As we continue to pursue economic growth and development, it is important to remember that our environment is not just a resource to be exploited, but a fragile ecosystem that we need to maintain and protect. We need to take concrete actions to ensure that our natural resources are preserved for future generations and that our planet remains a livable place for all.</p><p></p><p>[tex]\\\[-Tricia[/tex]</p><br />

                        <p>The global health initiatives of our government are essential for addressing current health issues and trends. These initiatives provide a framework for governments, organizations, and individuals to work together to improve the health of people around the world. They also provide resources and support to help countries develop effective strategies to address their own health challenges.</p><p></p><p>The global health initiatives of our government focus on a variety of areas, including disease prevention and control, access to healthcare, nutrition, mental health, and environmental sustainability. These initiatives are designed to reduce the burden of disease and improve the quality of life for people in all countries. By providing resources and support for these initiatives, our government is helping to ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare services.</p><p></p><p>In addition, global health initiatives can help reduce disparities in healthcare access between different populations. For example, many countries have implemented programs that provide free or low-cost healthcare services for vulnerable populations such as children or those living in poverty. These programs can help reduce disparities in access to care between different populations by providing equal access to quality healthcare services regardless of income level or other factors. </p><p></p><p>Finally, global health initiatives can help promote public awareness about important health issues such as HIV/AIDS or malaria. By raising awareness about these issues through campaigns and other forms of outreach, our government can help ensure that people are informed about the risks associated with these diseases and how they can protect themselves from them. This increased awareness can lead to better prevention efforts which can ultimately lead to improved public health outcomes around the world. </p><p></p><p>Overall, the global health initiatives of our government are essential for addressing current health issues and trends around the world. By providing resources and support for these initiatives, our government is helping ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare services regardless of their income level or other factors. In addition, these initiatives can help reduce disparities in healthcare access between different populations while also promoting public awareness about important health issues such as HIV/AIDS or malaria.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Global health initiatives are important programs implemented by governments to address current health issues and trends. These initiatives are focused on promoting the health and well-being of the population through the provision of medical services, education, research, and development.</p><p></p><p>One of the main benefits of these initiatives is that they help to address global health concerns that are beyond the capacity of individual countries to address. For instance, the outbreak of pandemics such as COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of global health initiatives in combating diseases that pose a threat to the global population. Through international cooperation, governments can work together to develop vaccines, provide medical supplies, and support research to find effective treatments for these diseases.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, global health initiatives help to improve the overall health of populations in developing countries. Often, these countries have limited access to medical care, sanitation, and clean water. Global health initiatives help to address these challenges by providing funding, training, and resources to improve the quality of health care, increase access to medical services, and promote disease prevention and health education.</p><p></p><p>In addition, global health initiatives help to promote economic development by improving the health of populations. Healthy populations are more productive and better able to contribute to the growth of their communities and nations. Furthermore, improved health care and disease prevention can reduce healthcare costs and improve overall economic outcomes.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the importance of global health initiatives cannot be overstated. They are essential in addressing the current health issues and trends affecting our world, improving access to medical care, promoting disease prevention, and contributing to economic development. Governments must continue to prioritize and invest in these initiatives to ensure the health and well-being of their citizens and the global community as a whole.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Anwers:Globalization is about the interconnectedness of people and businesses across the world that eventually leads to global cultural, political and economic integration. It is the ability to move and communicate easily with others all over the world in order to conduct business internationally. The word, globalization, is relatively new, coined in the late 1970’s. The airplane, the telephone, and the Internet are just three inventions, which are attributable to the spread of globalization. Due to the increased demand in the high tech industry around the world, business and industry have potential for huge profits working globally. So in today’s world, globalization is an important concept for students in higher education to understand and appreciate because of the demand in business and industry to hire people who can work with people of other nations and cultures and if need be can travel independently internationally to promote their business or industry.

Reading may be boring to others, but the importance of this is to clear our heads and indulge ourselves in a world of a million words that clash together to make a compelling story that hooks us. This also helps us broaden our vocabulary and improve our understanding. Making friends is not a problem. People connect with others using books as their subject. It's like a seed that when watered, it sprouts into different possibilities. This can be used as a stress reliever since it relaxes our brain. </p><p></p><p></p><p>(sorry di nako nakaabot ng 300 words at nakalagay ng title, nagutom kasi ako)</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
