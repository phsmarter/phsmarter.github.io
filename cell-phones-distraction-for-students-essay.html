                                            A nationwide survey of Middle School students was conducted to determine whether or not talking or texting on a cell phone can be a distraction.  A total of 37,000  cell phone owners were surveyed and of those surveyed it showed that 9,250  had someone who was talking or texting walk into them.      If 192  students at Sebastian Middle School were randomly surveyed, I would predict that   of them will have someone who was talking or texting walk into them.</a>

The idea of excessive "screen time" worries many educators. Children can spend two hours to four hours each day in front of screens. Educators recommended that children engage in active play, and read. "Screen time" should be limited.​</a>

There are phones in each classroom and front office which can There has been a lot of discussion lately about whether kids should be allowed to use cell phones in be used for emergencies or to contact parents when that is needed. Phones can be a major distraction for many kids Also, these days phones can be used by some kids to bully others. Today's modern classrooms have phones that dial out. There is also a phone in the office. If someon needs to call a student's parent it can be done from one of the phones in the school in the unlikely event there is a weather emergency and power goes out, including the phone lines, all of the teachers have cell phones which they can use. There is really no reason for students to have a phone with them-up until tes years ago cell phones were not around and students managed just fine in school all day. Cell phones can be a big distraction during the school day. If kids bring their phones to class and to use them they won't be paying attention. There are too many games and apps on phones that can ou attention away from what they are supposed to be doing in school/There are already so many things th distract kids away from their lessons without adding cell phones to the mix. Cell phones are another way that kids bully each other. There are already too many ways kids mean to each other at school, phones would just add another method for mean-spirited kids to haras kids/Unfortunately, there are always a few kids who go out of their way to give others a hard time ar phones are allowed in school it will give them one more tool to use to hurt others.

                            9. 2. Modern cell phones are sophisticated device. Cell phones don't contribute to leaming potentially a distraction says Thomas Sherman. The idea of excessive "screen time" worries many educators. Children can spend two hours to four hours each day in front of screens. Educators recommended that children engage in active play, and read. "Screen time" should be limited.​</h2><br />
                        <p>Sherman listed a few other reasons for not having cell phones in school including that the ringing can be a distraction. Cell phones could contribute to social inequities creating a new level of "have/have-not" distinction. There may also be a "keep up with Jones'" response as new and fancier phone technology comes along. Cell phones are small and getting smaller, thus, are easily lost and a potential target for theft.</p><br />

A nationwide survey of middle school students was conducted to determine whether or not talking or texting on a cell phone can be a distraction. A total of 37,000 cell phone owners were surveyed and of those surveyed it showed that 9,250 had someone who was talking or texting walk into them</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The survey found that out of 37,000 middle school students who owned cell phones, 9,250 reported that they had experienced someone walking into them while talking or texting on their phone. This suggests that a significant number of students are potentially distracted by their cell phones while walking, and that this behavior may pose a safety risk. It's important to note that this survey only captures self-reported incidents and may not be representative of the broader population, so further research may be needed to fully understand the impact of cell phone use on safety</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Love: Inspiration or Distraction?</p><p></p><p>Love is a powerful emotion that can inspire us to do great things or distract us from achieving our goals. It can be a source of motivation and drive, or it can be a hindrance that keeps us from reaching our full potential. Some people believe that love is an essential ingredient for a fulfilling life, while others argue that it can be a dangerous distraction that leads to heartache and disappointment.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, love can be a great source of inspiration. It can give us a reason to work hard and strive for success, knowing that we are building a future with someone we love. Love can inspire us to be better people, to care more deeply for others, and to make a positive impact on the world.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, love can also be a distraction. It can consume our thoughts and emotions, making it difficult to focus on other important aspects of our lives, such as our careers or personal development. Love can also be a source of stress and anxiety, particularly when the relationship is going through a rough patch or when we fear losing the person we love.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, whether love is an inspiration or a distraction depends on how we approach it. If we are able to maintain a healthy balance between our love life and other aspects of our lives, then love can be a positive force that inspires us to be our best selves. However, if we allow love to consume us or neglect other important aspects of our lives in the pursuit of love, then it can become a distraction that holds us back.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, love can be both an inspiration and a distraction, depending on how we choose to approach it. By finding a healthy balance between our love lives and other aspects of our lives, we can ensure that love remains a positive force that inspires us to be the best version of ourselves.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS ^√^</p><br />
