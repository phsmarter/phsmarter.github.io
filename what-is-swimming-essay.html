This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

                            7. For items 6-10, read the passage below to answer the following items. It is odd, but in our family, love always began with a fall of some form or another. This thought occurred to me when my own first love began. I spent one night foolishly thinking about this, but the cocks crowed and Mother woke up to prepare Father's breakfast, and still, I had no answer. When Grandfather was still alive, he used to tell us, between coughs, what happened to him, one day when he was fifteen. He was sleeping on the bank of the river after swimming when suddenly a strong wind came. It shook the coconut tree nearby, and fruit, like a wooden rolling pin, fell straight on his left shoulder. Grandfather screamed with pain, and his cry was so loud and terrible that several girls bathing around the bend of the river draped their sarongs about them and rushed to where he was. One of the girls helplessly held her sarong in her hands and in her excitement and fright, did not know what to do with it. When Grandfather saw her, he forgot his pain quickly, and a year later, she became Grandmother. (Celso Carunungan, Like a Big Brave Man) 6.

                            22. ESSAY:In swimming,what components/parameters of fitness that you would like to emphasize,to set/give more degree in terms of training? why? ​</h2><br />
                        Answer:<br /><br />Train first. If you do find that your weakness comes down to people, offer training. Training good people is less expensive than hiring new ones, especially if you have valuable talent that just doesn't have the skills to go to the next level. This includes hard skills and best practices, but also softer skills like management and leadership training. Many companies are plagued by immaturity in one aspect or another. The good news is, true to the cliche: knowing you have a problem is the first and hardest step and you may be there now. The next step is to take a hard and honest look at your company all the way up to the top to see how and where you need to grow up.<br /><br />In other cases, the VR headset can also make you know swimming.But it's furtherer than this.It can also make you think what it's like to be drowning under seas with dozens of food, sharks, and whales swimming in you.You can definitely have the feeling of being underwater because you would be able to look and learn the appearance and sounds of these sea animals.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sana makatulong sa inyo:)) pwede n’yo naman baguhin ang iba jan<br />
