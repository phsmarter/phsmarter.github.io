The Digital Divide By: Kim Czaccei Dacanay The digital divide exists in the Philippine education system for the longest time, but the Pandemic exposed just how bad it is. The digital divide is the barrier between those who have access to computers and the internet and those who don’t. Educational attainment is heavily affected by the digital divide, and this remains true to many countries in the world. Many provinces in the Philippines have a slim to none access to the internet connection. Students and teachers would have to climb high places to get internet access. Also, as reported by STAR last year, 13 million Filipino households don’t have electricity. Therefore, the transition to online classes will put certain Filipino student population at a stark disadvantage. If there’s no internetconnection, how can the students do research work? How can they interact with their instructors? How can they learn? Education must not be exclusive for people who are privileged enough to have a laptop and a stable internet connection. Education is for everyone. Write your judgement: ​</a>

Use the table to separate the opposing viewpoints of the article.   (1) Online education is far more affordable as compared to physical learning. (2) This is because online learning eliminates the cost points of student transportation, student meals, and most importantly, real estate.   (3) Additionally, all the course or study materials are available online, thus creating a paperless learning environment which is more affordable, while also being beneficial to the environment.   (4) For many students, one of the biggest challenges of online learning is the struggle with focusing on the screen for long periods of time. (5) With online learning, there is also a greater chance for students to be easily distracted by social media or other sites.   (6) Therefore, it is imperative for the teachers to keep their online classes crisp, engaging, and interactive to help students stay focused on the lesson.DIFFERING VIEWPOINTAdvantage of Online Education	Disadvantage of Online EducationSANA PO MAY SUMAGOT​</a>

Saving money is a manageable thing for most people. The key, though, is understanding how to go about it in a proper way. It takes some motivation, organization, and determination. Sometimes it seems like a mystery, though, as it appears money slips out of the hands of some people. That is why "How to save money is one of the most common questions on the internet. The five ways to save money in a practical way: record your spending, create a budget, make a plan for saving money, have a savings goal for certain items, and decide on your priorities. It seems everything is moving online these days. Even our education is transferring onto the internet. Many people might squabble about the disadvantages of this phenomena, but today, I want to discuss the advantages of getting an education online. This is a pertinent topic, as the future of education is moving more and more towards shifting physical educational institutions online. There are reasons for this: many times you can leam whatever you want, it is more comfortable in a variety of ways, online courses often look good on resumes, the pacing of learning is managed by the learner, and the cost of virtual education is often lower than traditional education.​</h2><br />

The Digital Divide By: Kim Czaccei Dacanay The digital divide exists in the Philippine education system for the longest time, but the Pandemic exposed just how bad it is. The digital divide is the barrier between those who have access to computers and the internet and those who don’t. Educational attainment is heavily affected by the digital divide, and this remains true to many countries in the world. Many provinces in the Philippines have a slim to none access to the internet connection. Students and teachers would have to climb high places to get internet access. Also, as reported by STAR last year, 13 million Filipino households don’t have electricity. Therefore, the transition to online classes will put certain Filipino student population at a stark disadvantage. If there’s no internetconnection, how can the students do research work? How can they interact with their instructors? How can they learn? Education must not be exclusive for people who are privileged enough to have a laptop and a stable internet connection. Education is for everyone. Write your judgement: ​</h2><br />

Use the table to separate the opposing viewpoints of the article.   (1) Online education is far more affordable as compared to physical learning. (2) This is because online learning eliminates the cost points of student transportation, student meals, and most importantly, real estate.   (3) Additionally, all the course or study materials are available online, thus creating a paperless learning environment which is more affordable, while also being beneficial to the environment.   (4) For many students, one of the biggest challenges of online learning is the struggle with focusing on the screen for long periods of time. (5) With online learning, there is also a greater chance for students to be easily distracted by social media or other sites.   (6) Therefore, it is imperative for the teachers to keep their online classes crisp, engaging, and interactive to help students stay focused on the lesson.DIFFERING VIEWPOINTAdvantage of Online Education	Disadvantage of Online EducationSANA PO MAY SUMAGOT​</h2><br />
