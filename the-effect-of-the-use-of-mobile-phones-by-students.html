                                            0 Students Should Not Be Allowed to Bring Mobile Phones to School (Excerpted) In recent times, the number of people owning mobile phones has increased dramatically. Now mobile phones are not just for calling, but you can now text, take and send pictures, record videos, access the internet, play games and much more The variety of functions has increased dramatically. They have also become a lot cheaper. Thus more and more young people now own a mobile. So should they be allowed to bring them to school? Mobile phones can cause a distraction in education. They can disturb teachers and students For example, if you were working hard on a piece of work, concentrating hard, and a person's phone rings, it disrupts the whole class. You may become side- tracked or the teacher may be interrupted during speaking to the class. Thus teaching would be constantly disrupted if this kept happening. Thus education standards would deteriorate. Looking then at long term effects, if this was happening every day, you would be wasting five minutes a day, so nearly half an hour a week, and so that would be over ten hours a year of disruption. Also, mobile phones provide a large temptation to cheat in tests. They can communicate to almost anywhere and anyone in the world. Because they are small, students can quietly and discreetly send a text and it can go unnoticed. You got to school to learn, not to waste time playing games or cheating in tests. Research has proven that frequent use of a mobile phone can put the owner at risk of long term health damage. Mobile phones have radiation in them which they send out which can destroy or damage cells. Thus a student who uses a mobile phone regularly is at risk of health damage. With the increase in ownership of mobiles, there 3.do you agree with the whiter? 4.what kind of whiting is this?​</a>

Put a check (/) if you think that the specific requirement is being satisfied by the sample conclusion and X, if it does not. This study proves the strong potentials of having phones as supplement learning tools to class discussions. Phones can maximize the learning capacity of the students by allowing them to leaf through information and note-taking. Most of the students have thought it beneficial and have positive effects in their academic performance and such was proven by the rejection of the null hypothesis and acceptance of the alternative hypothesis. However, through this research also, it was found out that even if most of the students believe in its potentials, they too know that there are risks or disadvantages on its usage such as distraction, bullying, and possible cheating. Therefore, the use of phones may be beneficial, but it has its disadvantages as well. Its actual usage needs optimum control coming from the side of the student, teacher, and school administration.

                            4. 0 Students Should Not Be Allowed to Bring Mobile Phones to School (Excerpted) In recent times, the number of people owning mobile phones has increased dramatically. Now mobile phones are not just for calling, but you can now text, take and send pictures, record videos, access the internet, play games and much more The variety of functions has increased dramatically. They have also become a lot cheaper. Thus more and more young people now own a mobile. So should they be allowed to bring them to school? Mobile phones can cause a distraction in education. They can disturb teachers and students For example, if you were working hard on a piece of work, concentrating hard, and a person's phone rings, it disrupts the whole class. You may become side- tracked or the teacher may be interrupted during speaking to the class. Thus teaching would be constantly disrupted if this kept happening. Thus education standards would deteriorate. Looking then at long term effects, if this was happening every day, you would be wasting five minutes a day, so nearly half an hour a week, and so that would be over ten hours a year of disruption. Also, mobile phones provide a large temptation to cheat in tests. They can communicate to almost anywhere and anyone in the world. Because they are small, students can quietly and discreetly send a text and it can go unnoticed. You got to school to learn, not to waste time playing games or cheating in tests. Research has proven that frequent use of a mobile phone can put the owner at risk of long term health damage. Mobile phones have radiation in them which they send out which can destroy or damage cells. Thus a student who uses a mobile phone regularly is at risk of health damage. With the increase in ownership of mobiles, there 3.do you agree with the whiter? 4.what kind of whiting is this?​</h2><br />

Put a check (/) if you think that the specific requirement is being satisfied by the sample conclusion and X, if it does not. This study proves the strong potentials of having phones as supplement learning tools to class discussions. Phones can maximize the learning capacity of the students by allowing them to leaf through information and note-taking. Most of the students have thought it beneficial and have positive effects in their academic performance and such was proven by the rejection of the null hypothesis and acceptance of the alternative hypothesis. However, through this research also, it was found out that even if most of the students believe in its potentials, they too know that there are risks or disadvantages on its usage such as distraction, bullying, and possible cheating. Therefore, the use of phones may be beneficial, but it has its disadvantages as well. Its actual usage needs optimum control coming from the side of the student, teacher, and school administration.
