Burnout; Nervous Breakdown; Major Depressive Episode. The health professionals all had different labels. The truth was, I was broken. Pride comes before the fall. Here was the inevitable fall. In the matter of a single moment sitting in front of my computer screen, my entire life changed course. Nothing would ever be the same again. I did not realize it at the time and thought that a day off was all that was required. It was not to be. The psychologist had a serious talk to me and I realized the seriousness of the situation I found myself in. I kept wondering how I had missed all the signs? It was plain to see, constant high blood pressure, inability to sleep, growing anxiety, lack of boundaries, stress, the list was almost endless.</p><p></p><p>My journey had begun.</p><p></p><p>For the first time that I can recall I had no destination in mind. I was broken. I did not want to be anywhere or do anything. I had lost the will to live and I didn’t care. Looking back at that time I don’t even recall having thoughts. I either lay in bed or sat on a chair under a blanket. I simply existed, as if in some strange comatose state, whether this was brought on by the breakdown or the handful of tablets that I was required to take every day I am not sure. None the less I was little more than an inanimate object. My fiancé took great care of me, prepared meals, handled whatever business fallouts were taking place, encouraging me to rest and give it time, inviting me to try to make tiny steps towards recovery.</p><p></p><p>This was not how I imagined the journey would be. After all, when they say that it is about the journey, not the destination, one would think that the journey should at least be enjoyable. I could find absolutely no joy in anything.</p><p></p><p>There is also a saying that: “every cloud has a silver lining.” Fortunately, that has also proven to be true for me. My brother in law bought me a return ticket to go visit them in India, and I accepted the gift as I needed to just get away from the world. In March this year, I nervously embarked on a journey to go spend some time with them in India. I did not have any plans to do anything in India, and the main reason for me going was just to get away from everything for a while. Even if the only thing I did whilst I was in India was stay in their house for 6 weeks that would have worked for me.</p><p></p><p>Something inside me shifted though. The moment I said goodbye to my fiancé and stepdaughter and walked through to departures I knew that I was on my own from here. I knew that it was now up to me to create the context for how this journey would unfold.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong># Carry On learning</strong><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Each person’s life is a journey on a contorted road dotted with bumps and craters. At certain points, the bumps could seem as high as mountains and the pits as deep as lots, making this journey called life appear quite despondent. Although occasionally, your predicaments are entirely fate’s blunders, but perchance, they are your own. Your personal characteristics roughly resemble a steering wheel for your journey. They could be positive traits, which could steer you on a more decent path; or negative traits, which could steer you to a path that’s, well… not so decent. Although you have no control over fate, you have power over your own “driving skills”, and could thus widen or narrow your chance for a smooth, prosperous journey. Also, it is beneficial to remember that you are not alone, for there are many other roads that coincide with yours, where others are conducting through their own journeys and floundering through their own bumps and craters as well. Drive together, and you could purvey support and encouragement for one another, and thus institute milder paths for all of you. Most prominently, no matter how harsh the terrain of your road becomes, just remember that you will pull through and be transformed for the better because of it.</p><p></p><p>This optimistic philosophy that I’ve adopted had been much solace to me in my own journey in becoming a successful high school student. It was not at all easy. Although fate has been overall lenient to me, it was my “driving skills” that tended to direct my course towards huge bumps. Despite my awareness of my own flaws and omissions, I still compulsorily reproached others and sought ways to exonerate myself. This was one of the worst traits I retain. It precluded me from obtaining responsibility for my choices and learning from past oversights, thus impeded my maturing process. For example, my projects were oftentimes undone till the last minute (including this one). I would think to myself, “I don’t feel like doing it today, so I’ll work on it tomorrow”. Thus the project was delayed further and further until there was no “tomorrow” for it anymore, and then I would end up working well over midnight while secretly scowling at the teacher for giving out such a tedious and inane assignment. Immaturity and refusal to admit my errors caused me to plunge into countless pits in my journey. The one positive trait that had proved to be highly efficient in boosting me out of these pits is ambition. I know that too much of it could corrupt a person, but so far it had only empowered my spirit with much-needed optimism. My greatest ambition is to become a renowned novelist; therefore every hardship and pain to me befits an inspiration for a potential novel. It is a most optimistic perception of things, and it had succoured me through many phases of emotional turmoil.</p><br />

                        <p>My life journey has been incredible thus far, with every step I have taken growing my knowledge and understanding of the world I live in. It started out at a young age, when I was fortunate enough to have parents who encouraged me to try anything and everything. Whether it was a sport, a club, or a school subject, I was able to experience firsthand new activities, meet new people, and see new places. It was from this youthful curiosity that I began to learn about life and the world around me.</p><p></p><p>Throughout high school, I was able to focus this curiosity into different extracurricular activities and academic goals. Through rigorous classes, clubs, sports, and volunteer opportunities, I was able to make connections and form relationships with people of all backgrounds. I was given an incredible opportunity to travel throughout the United States, visiting places such as New York, California, and even the border of Mexico. I think these trips shaped my outlook on the world, introducing me to cultures I hadn't been previously exposed to, and it showed me the potential of what is out there in the world.</p><p></p><p>When it came time to choose which college I should go to, followed by what career path I should pursue, I was unaware of where this journey would take me. I knew I wanted to do something important, something that would make an impact on the world. This led me to pursue a degree in engineering, which has taken me on a path of growth and discovery. I had never been exposed to the world of engineering or technology before, but since entering this field, I have kept learning and pushing myself to my limits. I have had the pleasure of working with various people from around the world, of different backgrounds and cultures, and learning from each of them has added another layer to my journey of understanding.</p><p></p><p>No matter where this journey takes me, I will continue to strive for greatness. My dream is to create something that changes the lives of many, leaving a lasting impact on the world. As I continue to travel this path, my motivation to continue learning remains the same. With every step, I will continue to challenge myself and grow my knowledge so that I can make this dream come true.</p><br />

During these years, I have had the opportunity to explore new subjects, meet new people, and develop new skills that will serve me well throughout my life.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant changes I experienced during my junior high school years was the shift from a more general education to a more specialized curriculum.

This allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of these subjects and prepare for the more advanced coursework that awaits me in high school and beyond.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of my junior high school journey has been the opportunity to make new friends and expand my social circle.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My Learning Journey in ALS</p><p></p><p>Alternative Learning System (ALS) is an educational program that provides opportunities for Filipinos who have not completed their basic education to obtain a secondary school diploma. As a student of ALS, my journey has been challenging but fulfilling. It has taught me valuable lessons that have helped me grow as a person and as a learner.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant lessons I have learned in ALS is the importance of perseverance. The program requires dedication, hard work, and discipline. There were times when I felt discouraged and overwhelmed by the amount of work that needed to be done, but I learned to push through and keep going. I realized that with determination and persistence, I could overcome any obstacle.</p><p></p><p>Another lesson I have learned in ALS is the value of time management. The program has a self-directed learning approach, which means that students are responsible for managing their own time and completing the modules on their own. I learned to prioritize my tasks, set deadlines, and avoid procrastination. I also realized that time is a precious commodity and that I should use it wisely to achieve my goals.</p><p></p><p>ALS has also taught me the importance of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The program emphasizes independent learning and encourages students to think critically, analyze information, and come up with solutions to problems. I learned to question assumptions, evaluate evidence, and make informed decisions. These skills have not only helped me in my studies but also in my personal and professional life.</p><p></p><p>Finally, ALS has taught me the value of education. It has given me a second chance to pursue my dreams and improve my life. It has also made me realize that education is a lifelong journey, and there is always room for growth and improvement. I learned to appreciate the power of knowledge and how it can transform lives.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, my learning journey in ALS has been a transformative experience. It has taught me valuable lessons that have helped me grow as a person and as a learner. I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of this program and for the support and guidance of my teachers and fellow students. I look forward to continuing my education and making a positive impact in my community.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>i hope it helps po! please rate me a 5 stars, thank u!</p><br />

Until one day, Agni came barging right into my class and later into my life. We were like chalk and cheese. We still are. Yet love found us.</p><p></p><p>For most in the list, travel brought them together. But it was not so in our case. Agni was not so fond of travelling, but he too had the same enthusiasm to explore the unknown and do all that others might not want to venture into.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. As the disease progresses, people with ALS may experience a range of physical and cognitive changes that can impact their ability to learn and retain new information. Despite these challenges, learning can still be an important part of a person's journey with ALS.</p><p></p><p>One of the key ways that learning can be integrated into the ALS journey is by keeping the mind active. Engaging in mentally stimulating activities such as reading, writing, puzzles, and games can help keep the mind sharp and improve cognitive function. This is particularly important as ALS can cause cognitive changes such as difficulty with language, memory, and problem-solving.</p><p></p><p>Another way that learning can be incorporated into the ALS journey is by attending support groups. Joining a support group for people with ALS can provide opportunities to learn from others who are going through similar experiences, share knowledge and insights, and receive emotional support. Support groups can also provide a sense of community and belonging, which can be particularly valuable for people with ALS who may feel isolated or disconnected from others.</p><p></p><p>Attending regular medical appointments is also an important part of the ALS journey, as it provides an opportunity to learn about the progression of the disease and new treatments and therapies that may help manage symptoms. Participating in research studies can also provide access to new treatments and therapies that may improve quality of life and slow the progression of the disease.</p><p></p><p>Assistive technology devices can also play a key role in enabling people with ALS to continue learning and engaging with the world around them. Speech-generating devices, eye-tracking systems, and mobility aids are just a few examples of the many assistive technology devices that can help people with ALS continue to communicate, learn, and participate in daily activities.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, learning can be an important part of a person's journey with ALS. Despite the challenges that come with this disease, there are many ways to continue learning and growing, from keeping the mind active to participating in research studies and using assistive technology devices. By staying engaged in learning and seeking out resources and support, people with ALS can continue to thrive and live a fulfilling life.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>diko alam kung ilang words kailangan mo pero 2000 words yan.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Many things have changed as a result of COVID-19. Normally I would be at school on the weekdays expanding my mind, but with everything happening with COVID-19 my school and many others have been shut down for the remainder of the year. Instead of being in a classroom and learning, we are sent packets and given work online. You’re probably thinking "well at least you still get to learn,” and that may be true but not everyone has the resources to learn, or maybe we learn better in a classroom setting. School being closed is just one way COVID-19 has caused a lot of damage.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Mathematics is a school subject that people have mixed feeling about. Many of my personal friends complain about math and express their dislike and hatred towards the subject. I, on the other hand, seem to enjoy math most of the time. Although I sometimes feel angry when I continue to get a certain problem incorrect, I always put my best effort into finding my mistake and fixing it. I have had some amazing math teachers, but I’ve also had some very bad ones. I think that my teacher has a huge effect upon how well I will learn that subject, which can be considered good or bad. I have always realized that math is a very important topic, so I have consistently worked very hard to learn it.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There has never been a time when art critics held more power than during the second half of the twentieth century. Following the Second World War, with the relocation of the world’s artistic epicenter from Paris to New York, a different kind of war was waged in the pages of magazines across the country. As part of the larger “culture wars” of the mid-century, art critics began to take on greater influence than they’d ever held before. For a time, two critics in particular—who began as friends, and remained in the same social circles for much of their lives—set the stakes of the debates surrounding the maturation of American art that would continue for decades. The ideas about art outlined by Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg are still debated today, and the extent to which they were debated in the past has shaped entire movements of the arts. Below are ten works of criticism through which one can trace the mainstreaming of Clement Greenberg’s formalist theory, and how its dismantling led us into institutional critique and conceptual art today.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest mwaa</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dave Hood</p><p></p><p>One way to write a personal narrative in creative nonfiction is to tell a story about a journey. All journeys have a starting point and destination. The journey usually begins with some question, which the central character desires to learn from the journey.  Along the path, the character is a participant in a series of events, which impact his/her psyche. The character also faces setbacks and obstacles, encounters a crisis, participates in story that has  climax, and ends with a resolution. The journey also provides the character with new insights or illuminations, which help to answer a nagging question. Often the central character experiences an epiphany or a lesson that you learned.</p><p></p><p>This is certainly true for the creative nonfiction book, ” Into the Wild,” a true story written by Jon Krakauer,  about a young, idealistic man who abandons his possessions, gives away all of his $24,000 in a savings account, and then journeys across the United States, then to Alaska, where he dies by misadventure. It is a sad, true story of a journey about a naive man. Near death, dying from unintentional poisoning (He eat poison berries in an effort to prevent starvation), Christopher McCandless, the central character, realizes that “man cannot be an island unto himself.” Happiness must be shared.</p><p></p><p>Writing about a journey, a quest, or a pilgrimage is a popular form of creative nonfiction. Esteemed writer, E.B White, in his narrative a journey called “Walden”, shares a story about his trip to pay homage to Henry David Thoreau. (You can read it in Creative Nonfiction by Eileen Pollack) He writes about the trip by car, the surroundings at Walden pond, and personal reflections at Walden.</p><p></p><p>Author Elizabeth Gilbert wrote a bestselling book called “Eat, Pray, Love” in which she shares her journey to find herself after her marriage ends. She shares her reflections and describes the surroundings, adventures, new experiences, people she meets, cuisine, and culture while  traveling to Italy, India, Indonesia.</p><p></p><p>Not only can a writer craft essays about a journey, the writer can also write entire books about a journey. Author Michael Krasny wrote about a spiritual quest in “Spiritual Envy: An Agnostic’s Quest.” Krasny narrates a life story about his struggles with faith, his ambivalence toward religious doctrine, and his desire to answer a variety of metaphysical questions, such as Does God exist?</p><p></p><p>In this article, I’ll explain how write a personal essay or literary journalism essay about a journey, quest, or pilgrimage from a creative nonfiction perspective. First, I’ll define the difference between a journey, quest, and pilgrimage. Then I’ll explain the elements of a story, followed by an explanation of the narrative arc or story structure. Finally, I’ll identify a few tools and tips for writing about a journey, quest, or narrative.</p><br />
