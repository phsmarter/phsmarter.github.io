1. How did the school program prepare the students
for what they will do after they graduated from
high school?
2. What are the prepared programs of the school for
their students after they graduated from high
school?
3. How does restricting the use of mobile phones in
school affect the student's social interaction?
4. How do students define online learning
engagement?</h2><br />
                        <br />1. Offer a college preparatory curriculum and make sure that, by ninth grade, students understand academic requirements for college entry and success. Use assessment throughout high school to help students understand their relative readiness for college, and help them address any identified deficiencies.<br /><br />3. Although cell phones also have opened the door to be able to communicate in different ways, they also have less interactions because people are constantly on their phones or checking them which distracts them from the present moment.<br /><br />4. online learning is beneficial to the students, tutors and the institution offering these courses. I would therefore recommend that online learning be implemented on all learning institutions and research on how to improve this learning process should be carried out.<br /><br />hope it helps!<br />
