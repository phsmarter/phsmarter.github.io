                        <p>The author presents his main theme of fate by bringing the reader to a family’s holiday which is unfortunately brought to a sudden end by a murder (O’Connor 36). The grandmother argues that the family should go to Tennessee instead of Florida. Her insistence makes the family to deviate from the right path in an attempt to look for a fake treasure. The rebelliousness the family exhibits is a sign of moral decadence. The grandmother’s decision makes the family appear like it admires the Misfit. At the beginning of the story, the author illustrates clearly that the family was to suffer in the hands of Misfit. O’Connor effectively uses characterization in this story. He uses symbolism to show how the morals of a society have been destroyed (O’Connor 36).
</p><p>Discussion
</p><p>In the story ”A Good Man Is Hard to Find”, the author features the grandmother as a central character. Her character is evidently presented in the story as a very pushy persona who dearly loves herself to an extent of being myopic (O’Connor 36). Similarly, the author paints her as an authoritative and manipulative person. This is confirmed when she manages to push the family to reschedule its plan. Her mean character is noticeably shown when she wants to visit the house she used to live in when she was young. Following her conversation with her son Bailey, the old woman tries to pressure him to change his plan to her advantage. Her character is the same up till the end of the story (Getz 234).
</p><p>O’Connor extensively uses characterization to bring out lack of respect and poor discipline in America’s society. The message in his story can be understood from differences that subsist between the old and young generations (O’Connor 36). The grandmother in the story symbolizes the old generation. The author describes how the old lady clothes herself such that even if a misfortune occurs, any person could easily recognize that she was a female because of her dressing. In the past, there were good morals. The children could respect the elder people and everybody in the society would reinforce such behavior all the time (Getz 234). However, the grandchildren are immoral and undisciplined. The author through his employing of characterization elements shows that Misfit is a product of crumbled values and culture devoid of demeanor. However, Misfit seems to be respectful in a way especially when he uses polite words like ‘Maam’.
</p><p>Similarly, O’Connor uses symbolism in the story to show bereavement and faith. The author says that the family deviates from the good road to follow a dreadful one where they end up getting killed. This symbolizes how people move away from the kingdom of God to go to down the evil paths. The town’s name called “Toombsboro” is used by the author to symbolize death (O’Connor 36). The old woman hopes that she would find a plantation in Toombsboro town. It is in this town still that the old lady is sidetracked. This symbolizes that her faith in Jesus is getting low. In the story, the author writes that June and John tries to guess what the sky’s color is. The clouds in are used by the author to present the faith of the old lady (Getz 234). At the end of the story, we are told that there are no clouds anymore and the sky has nothing. The author is trying to show that the old woman’s faith at that stage is already depleted. The author uses a grave yard to symbolize death. Furthermore, in his quote “big black battered hearse like automobile” is applied to show that death is the final destination (O’Connor 36).
</p><p>The author strongly backs up his theme by titling the story “A Good man is hard to find”. He uses personalities like Misfit to support it. This propping up is evidenced by the use the grandchildren and Jesus. In the story, the old woman says that she could go with her children anywhere and could give answer to her consciousness if possible. Finally, this lady comes into a situation where she tries to give answers to her conscience by frustratingly assuming that Misfit is not a bad person. Misfit on the other hand insists that indeed he is a bad person (O’Connor 36). Misfit compares himself to Jesus where he says that Jesus suffered for other people’s sins just the same way he got punished for mistakes he never did. The theme that “a good man is hard to find” undoubtedly refers to Jesus. This is because Misfit tries to compare himself to Jesus but he finally commits a murder. The old woman’s shaky faith in Jesus is over. By Jesus not delivering her shows that indeed “a good man is hard to find.”

                            5. Using historical approach, write a critique paper about the story "Voices" by Alice Munro i need this pls answer:(​</h2><br />
                        "Voices" by Alice Munro is a short story that explores the themes of memory, identity, and the complexities of human relationships. By examining the story through a historical approach, it is possible to gain a deeper understanding of its underlying social and cultural contexts, as well as its significance within the broader literary tradition.<br /><br />The story is set in the mid-20th century, in a small rural town in Canada, where the protagonist, the narrator, reflects on her past and her relationships with various family members and acquaintances. The historical context of the story is important, as it reflects the changing social and cultural landscape of Canada during this time. The story takes place in a post-World War II era, where the traditional gender roles and social hierarchies were being challenged by the feminist and civil rights movements. The story also addresses the impact of the war on the lives of ordinary people, particularly women, and how it shaped their experiences and identities.<br /><br />One of the most significant aspects of the story is its portrayal of the complexities of human relationships. Munro's characters are portrayed as flawed and imperfect, struggling to connect with each other and often failing in their attempts to do so. The story suggests that the complexities of human relationships are rooted in our individual experiences and memories, and that our sense of identity is shaped by the people and events that have influenced us.<br /><br />Furthermore, the story highlights the importance of memory in shaping our sense of self and our relationships with others. The narrator's memories of her past, particularly her childhood, play a central role in the story. Munro suggests that our memories are not fixed, but are instead subject to revision and reinterpretation, and that our understanding of our past is shaped by our current circumstances and relationships.<br /><br />In conclusion, "Voices" by Alice Munro is a powerful and thought-provoking story that offers a nuanced exploration of memory, identity, and the complexities of human relationships. By examining the story through a historical approach, we can gain a deeper understanding of its significance within the broader literary tradition and its relevance to the social and cultural context of its time. Munro's vivid and nuanced portrayal of her characters and their relationships make "Voices" a valuable contribution to the literary canon and a compelling commentary on the human condition.<br /><br />Makinig ka kasi!<br />

                            13. Give examples of critiques and reaction papers that you read recently. What was youpurpose in reading these texts?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Here are a number of questions that you can address as part of your critique. You need not answer them all, but questions one and two are essential to any book review, so those must be included. And these are ABSOLUTELY NOT to be answered one after another (seriatim). Don’t have one paragraph that answers one, and then the next paragraph that answers the next, etc. The answers should be part of a carefully constructed essay, complete with topic sentences and transitions.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. What is your overall opinion of the book? On what basis has this opinion been formulated? That is, tell the reader what you think and how you arrived at this judgment. What did you expect to learn when you picked up the book? To what extent – and how effectively – were your expectations met? Did you nod in agreement (or off to sleep)? Did you wish you could talk back to the author? Amplify upon and explain your reactions.</p><p></p><p>2. Identify the author’s thesis and explain it in your own words. How clearly and in what context is it stated and, subsequently, developed? To what extent and how effectively (i.e., with what kind of evidence) is this thesis proven? Use examples to amplify your responses. If arguments or perspectives were missing, why do you think this might be?</p><p></p><p>3. What are the author’s aims? How well have they been achieved, especially with regard to the way the book is organized? Are these aims supported or justified? (You might look back at the introduction to the book for help). How closely does the organization follow the author’s aims?</p><p></p><p>4. How are the author’s main points presented, explained, and supported? What assumptions lie behind these points? What would be the most effective way for you to compress and/or reorder the author’s scheme of presentation and argument?</p><p></p><p>5. How effectively does the author draw claims from the material being presented? Are connections between the claims and evidence made clearly and logically? Here you should definitely use examples to support your evaluation.</p><p></p><p>6. What conclusions does the author reach and how clearly are they stated? Do these conclusions follow from the thesis and aims and from the ways in which they were developed? In other words, how effectively does the book come together?</p><p></p><p>7. Identify the assumptions made by the author in both the approach to and the writing of the book. For example, what prior knowledge does the author expect readers to possess? How effectively are those assumptions worked into the overall presentation? What assumptions do you think should not have been made? Why?</p><p></p><p>8. Are you able to detect any underlying philosophy of history held by the author (e.g., progress, decline, cyclical, linear, and random)? If so, how does this philosophy affect the presentation of the argument?</p><p></p><p>9. How does the author see history as being motivated: primarily by the forces of individuals, economics, politics, social factors, nationalism, class, race, gender, something else? What kind of impact does this view of historical motivation have upon the way in which the author develops the book?</p><p></p><p>10. Does the author’s presentation seem fair and accurate? Is the interpretation biased? Can you detect any distortion, exaggeration, or diminishing of material? If so, for what purpose might this have been done, and what effect does hit have on the overall presentation?</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>The story I have chosen to critique is "The Cat with One Tail" by Agatha Christie.</p><p></p><p>This story, written by Agatha Christie, tells the tale of a mysterious cat that appears in an English village one day, with only one tail. As the villagers try to unravel the secret behind the cat's strange appearance, they uncover a surprising and sinister mystery.</p><p></p><p>The main strength of this story lies in its atmosphere. Through her vivid descriptions of the English countryside, Christie creates an eerie and unsettling mood that is further enhanced by the presence of the mysterious cat. There is a strong feeling of unease as the villagers attempt to unravel the cat's secret, and Christie does an excellent job of conveying this tension throughout the narrative.</p><p></p><p>The plot of the story is also well-crafted and engaging. Christie builds up the mystery gradually, allowing for suspense to build before finally revealing the cat's true identity. The twists and turns are cleverly done, and the reader is kept guessing until the very end.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the characters in this story are believable and sympathetic. The villagers have distinct personalities and motivations, and their conversations feel real and authentic.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Christie's writing style is elegant and precise. Her prose is descriptive and lyrical, and her use of imagery helps to bring the story to life.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, this is an excellent story that has a great atmosphere, a well-crafted plot, believable characters, and beautiful writing. I highly recommend it.</p><br />

                            30. give me a critique paper of the story of "A rose for Emily" by William Faulkner​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>"A Rose for Emily" by William Faulkner </strong></p><p>is a short story that explores themes of isolation, tradition, and the passing of time. The story is narrated by an unnamed narrator who speaks on behalf of the entire town of Jefferson, Mississippi. The narrator recounts the life of Emily Grierson, a reclusive woman who has lived in isolation for most of her life.</p><p></p><p>One of the strengths of this story is the way Faulkner uses a non-linear narrative structure to reveal the events of Emily's life. The story jumps back and forth in time, adding layers of meaning and complexity to the characters and their actions. This structure also creates a sense of mystery and intrigue, keeping the reader engaged until the end.</p><p></p><p>Another strength of the story is the way Faulkner uses symbols to add depth and meaning to the narrative. The title of the story, "A Rose for Emily," is a symbol of the love and affection that Emily never received. The rose also symbolizes Emily's fading beauty and the fleeting nature of life. Similarly, the house that Emily lives in is also symbolic, representing the decay of the Old South and the way time has passed it by.</p><p></p><p>However, one of the weaknesses of the story is the way the narrator speaks on behalf of the entire town of Jefferson. This creates a sense of homogeneity in the characters, and it is difficult to understand the motivations and feelings of individual characters. The narrator's voice also reinforces the idea that the town is complicit in Emily's isolation and her eventual descent into madness.</p><p></p><p>Overall, "A Rose for Emily" is a powerful and evocative story that explores themes of isolation, tradition, and the passing of time. The non-linear narrative structure and the use of symbols add depth and complexity to the story, but the use of a collective narrator diminishes the individuality of the characters. Despite this weakness, "A Rose for Emily" is a masterful and thought-provoking story that will continue to be studied and enjoyed for many years to come.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
