                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>(2) Filipino older adults tend to cope with illness with the help of family and friends, and by faith in God. Complete cure or even the slightest improvement in a malady or illness is viewed as a miracle. Filipino families greatly influence patients’ decisions about health care. Patients subjugate personal needs and tend to go along with the demands of a more authoritative family figure in order to maintain group harmony. Before seeking professional help, Filipino older adults tend to manage their illnesses by self-monitoring of symptoms, ascertaining possible causes, determining the severity and threat to functional capacity, and considering the financial and emotional burden to the family.</p><br />

Therefore from the inference or conclusion made, we can say that the word gregarious mean someone who socioalize or enjoys the compnay of others. </p><p></p>Antonyms and Contrasts<p>The last way of drawing conclusion is through antonyms and contrast.

As I have previously discussed, there are two versions of the history of this nation.</p><p></p><p>I. INDIOS ANCESTRAL HERITAGE</p><p></p><p>GENUINE HISTORY ACCORDING TO THE NATIVES OF THIS NATION</p><p>II. PHILIPPINE HISTORY</p><p></p><p>CORRUPTED VERSION AUTHORED BY EUROPEANS</p><p>Before I even try to provide my discussion on this, let me remind you and also the readers about what the Spaniards did after they were ALLOWED to meddle with our lives.</p><p></p><p>The Spaniards introduced themselves as the servants of God and claimed to have been sent to us by God to convert our ancestors to be like them because they claim that we are sinners, uncivilized, barbaric, etc. This was the reason why our ancestral name INDIOS came to be known as what it is today because this was how the Spaniards try to characterize our ancestors. The Spaniards even claimed that our skin color was a curse that God has bestowed upon us and a sign that we are sinners. Thus, to convert us to become the slaves that we are today, the Spaniards collected every record of our history and anything that reminds us about our past and they burned them or brought them back to their own country. Now, what do we have left to contain ourselves about our past? Worse, we try to submit to these so-called written histories such as that of Antonio de Morga, or Antonio Pigafetta, etc. including a supposed history contained in a book called BOXER CODEX. While we contend ourselves with these corrupted narratives called PHILIPPINES HISTORY propagated by Philippine historians and history teachers, we end up ignoring the true and genuine history of our own ancestral heritage.</p><p></p><p>INDIOS ANCESTRAL HERITAGE versus PHILIPPINE HISTORY</p><p></p><p>To better demonstrate the difference between the two, let us try to understand the TIMELINE of our history based on ESTABLISHED FACTS as provided by UNDISPUTED EVIDENCE</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

not agree about the Filipino people before the Spanish colonization. Provide evidence of

2. Do you think some of the observed characteristics of culture and practices of the early
Filipinos still exist now a days? Give examples, if there is. Justify if there is none.</h2><br />
                        1. The analysis of the above description of Antonio de Morga about the early inhabitants<p>I <strong>disagree</strong> that the Filipino people attacked other tribes and settlements, killed people, and committed numerous other atrocities before the Spanish colonization. Although this is always attempted through legal or illegal means, depending on the opportunity and necessity, it is impossible to stop them. The custom of giving young girls to these men and paying them to seduce them was also prevalent, as the people thought it was unlucky and uncouth if the females were virgins when they got married.</p><p></p>1. The characteristics of culture and practices of the early Filipinos still exist nowadays<p><strong>Yes</strong>, some of the recognized traits of the early Filipinos' culture and behaviors can still be found today. Examples of this include the following:</p>Before the arrival of the British, Filipinos were big consumers of imported goods, particularly Chinese silk and diamonds. Despite this, contemporary Filipinos still purchase<strong> products made in China.</strong>Filipinos today enjoy <strong>karaoke</strong> just as much as they did at pre-colonial community bonfires when stories were best told via song.Both Zarzuelas and Moro-Moros were popular in the colonial Philippines. Filipinos today like watching soap operas and <strong>telenovelas</strong>.<p></p>Further explanation:What do you believe the Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas by Antonio de Morga means?<p>The Sucesos is the product of an objective observer who was also a significant player in the drama of his era and a dynamic bureaucrat who was well familiar with how the government operated. In contrast to the religious chroniclers, it is also the<strong> first history of the Spanish Philippines </strong>to be written by a layperson.</p><p></p><p>There are free access online archives on Filipino history and culture in the age of the Internet, such as the sizable digital <strong>Filipiniana collection of the University of Michigan</strong>, which includes documents and images from the Philippines in the early 20th century. The University of Illinois at Chicago Field Museum is another excellent online repository for primary documents. Dean Worcester, the interior secretary of the American colonial government in the nation from 1901 to 1913, had a sizable photography collection there.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about Spanish colonization here: https://brainly.ph/question/2487699#</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
