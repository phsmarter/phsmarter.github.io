Identify the literary approach being referred to in the following 1. This refers to critical approaches that analyze, interpret or evaluate the inherent leatures of a text. These features include not only grammar and syntax but also literary devices such as meter and figures of speech. 2. It is a type of literary critique that judges the value of literature based on its moral or ethical teachings. 3. This approach in literary criticism is anchored on the political theory. The focus is to describe how social class, economy, money and power play a role in literary selections. The social class strugples in literature reflect how the low class are being dominated by the upper class in the society. The critic will dig into how the dominant groups exploit the minority groups in a text and how to redeem the status of said minority groups. 4. In this approach, the critic will look into how literature treats women such as their roles, images, portrayals, character, and chajacterization. It aims to uplift the women's status from a discriminated or silenced one into women who are equal with men. Its intention is not to overcome the men but both to have harmony and collaboration. 5. This approach in literary criticism perceives that each literary work is a product of its time and its world. It investigates how a tex: manifests the attitudes, beliefs, ideas and culture of the period it was created. In doing this, the reader or critic will look int the background of a story or a poem in order that he or she will understand the text better. Included in the background are the author, the time it was written, and the situation at that time. the following questions based on the poem "The Road Not Taken" by​</a>

Identify the literary approach being referred to in the following 1. This refers to critical approaches that analyze, interpret or evaluate the inherent leatures of a text. These features include not only grammar and syntax but also literary devices such as meter and figures of speech. 2. It is a type of literary critique that judges the value of literature based on its moral or ethical teachings. 3. This approach in literary criticism is anchored on the political theory. The focus is to describe how social class, economy, money and power play a role in literary selections. The social class strugples in literature reflect how the low class are being dominated by the upper class in the society. The critic will dig into how the dominant groups exploit the minority groups in a text and how to redeem the status of said minority groups. 4. In this approach, the critic will look into how literature treats women such as their roles, images, portrayals, character, and chajacterization. It aims to uplift the women's status from a discriminated or silenced one into women who are equal with men. Its intention is not to overcome the men but both to have harmony and collaboration. 5. This approach in literary criticism perceives that each literary work is a product of its time and its world. It investigates how a tex: manifests the attitudes, beliefs, ideas and culture of the period it was created. In doing this, the reader or critic will look int the background of a story or a poem in order that he or she will understand the text better. Included in the background are the author, the time it was written, and the situation at that time. the following questions based on the poem "The Road Not Taken" by​</h2><br />
