                                            Despite a less than ideal childhood, Anelisa marched against the grain and surprised his family when he was accepted into university. "Throughout my schooling, I stayed with my uncle and basically brought myself up as he is a taxi driver and works irregular hours and I received very little support from my family who live in the Eastern Cape," recounts Anelisa. Reflecting on the significance of 16 June in our country's history, Anelisa advises the country's youth to remember that our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate but that we are powerful beyond measure. "It's not our darkness but our light that most frightens us and as we let each one of our light's shine, we are unconsciously giving others the opportunity to do And his biggest concern about the world today? "A lack of humility! It seems many people work for financial gain only, rather than helping or contributing towards making the world a better place." Anelisa however believes that the world is full of opportunities. "With a great plan and enough ambition, we can all achieve all our goals." After fulfilling his dream of attending university, Anelisa graduated and was accepted on to Engen's prestigious graduate development programme. The Engen Graduate Development Programme sees graduates spend time across a broad range of business functions. To date Anelisa has worked in Engen's Fixed Asset Team and in the Tax Department as a graduate trainee. "I never imagined myself working for one of the petroleum industry leaders! "It was an exciting opportunity for me to join Engen and see how I can contribute to making the value chain more effective and efficient, so that ultimately real value is added to the end customer." As a graduate trainee at Engen, he is discovering where he best fits in within the company. "I really appreciate the company's culture and beliefs - they put their money into growing people skills, while the leadership style adopted by top management is indicative of how the company puts its employees first and creates a space for everyone to learn and grow as individuals." So, what is Anelisa's greatest ambition? "I really want to touch people's lives. I don't want to say change people's lives because I feel like it's up to each individual to change their own lives, but what I can do, is assist them in the process of changing their lives." Continuing to attract and grow talented young minds like Analisa Gazi, demonstrates Engen's ongoing commitment to developing our countries future experts and isaders. In 2020, the company invested R9.8 million in Learnerships and Bursaries. They also continue to provide supplementary Maths, Science and Technology tuition to approximately 1 800 under-privileged Grade 10 12 learners across South Africa through the Engen Maths and Science School programme.Questions1.2 Identify and explain TWO types of goals in line with Anelisa's story 1.3 Discuss any THREE challenges Anelisa experienced that could've been obstacles1.4 Analyse how Anelisa personal values contributed to his success1.5 Critically discuss how relationships can impact negatively on the achivements of goals ​</a>

                                            "The art of communication is the language of leadership." (James Humes) It is a mistake to believe that communication is a simple process. Although people communicate with one another every day, the real question is whether the ideas one has expressed are truly understood by another. Communication breakdowns happen in every part of the globe, and these have led to a plethora of problems. Effective communication can breach peace, spark revolutions, and affect change in government. However, to communicate properly, one cannot simply strive to express oneself and leave understanding to fate; one must also learn how to organize one's thoughts, control one's emotions, use one's words to articulate concepts and arguments, and express oneself in the best way possible. The art of one's communication reflects the art of one's thinking. According to James Berlin (1982), one of the major proponents of The New Rhetoric, "In teaching writing, we are not simply offering training in a useful technical skill that is meant as a simple complement to the more important studies of other areas. We are teaching a way of experiencing the world, a way of ordering and making sense of it" (776). This is also true when it comes to all the language skills essential in communication, whether this is in writing, reading. listening, or speaking. They are tools that help us analyze, critique, and negotiate with the world. To construct ideas and bring people to believe in one's vision, it is important to be able to communicate in an effective, articulate manner. On a personal level, honing one's communication skills can also bring about success to one's personal and professional life. To lead nations or corporations, communication skills are essential. To work smoothly as a team, communication is indispensable. And to create a vision that people will believe in, one needs to learn how to communicate purposefully in today's society. Questions: 1. What problems can happen when there are communication breakdowns? 2. What does Berlin mean when he says "(In teaching writing), we are teaching a way of experiencing the world, a way of ordering and making sense of it"? 3. Is this only true for writing? Explain.​</a>

                            17. Despite a less than ideal childhood, Anelisa marched against the grain and surprised his family when he was accepted into university. "Throughout my schooling, I stayed with my uncle and basically brought myself up as he is a taxi driver and works irregular hours and I received very little support from my family who live in the Eastern Cape," recounts Anelisa. Reflecting on the significance of 16 June in our country's history, Anelisa advises the country's youth to remember that our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate but that we are powerful beyond measure. "It's not our darkness but our light that most frightens us and as we let each one of our light's shine, we are unconsciously giving others the opportunity to do And his biggest concern about the world today? "A lack of humility! It seems many people work for financial gain only, rather than helping or contributing towards making the world a better place." Anelisa however believes that the world is full of opportunities. "With a great plan and enough ambition, we can all achieve all our goals." After fulfilling his dream of attending university, Anelisa graduated and was accepted on to Engen's prestigious graduate development programme. The Engen Graduate Development Programme sees graduates spend time across a broad range of business functions. To date Anelisa has worked in Engen's Fixed Asset Team and in the Tax Department as a graduate trainee. "I never imagined myself working for one of the petroleum industry leaders! "It was an exciting opportunity for me to join Engen and see how I can contribute to making the value chain more effective and efficient, so that ultimately real value is added to the end customer." As a graduate trainee at Engen, he is discovering where he best fits in within the company. "I really appreciate the company's culture and beliefs - they put their money into growing people skills, while the leadership style adopted by top management is indicative of how the company puts its employees first and creates a space for everyone to learn and grow as individuals." So, what is Anelisa's greatest ambition? "I really want to touch people's lives. I don't want to say change people's lives because I feel like it's up to each individual to change their own lives, but what I can do, is assist them in the process of changing their lives." Continuing to attract and grow talented young minds like Analisa Gazi, demonstrates Engen's ongoing commitment to developing our countries future experts and isaders. In 2020, the company invested R9.8 million in Learnerships and Bursaries. They also continue to provide supplementary Maths, Science and Technology tuition to approximately 1 800 under-privileged Grade 10 12 learners across South Africa through the Engen Maths and Science School programme.Questions1.2 Identify and explain TWO types of goals in line with Anelisa's story 1.3 Discuss any THREE challenges Anelisa experienced that could've been obstacles1.4 Analyse how Anelisa personal values contributed to his success1.5 Critically discuss how relationships can impact negatively on the achivements of goals ​</h2><br />

                            23. "The art of communication is the language of leadership." (James Humes) It is a mistake to believe that communication is a simple process. Although people communicate with one another every day, the real question is whether the ideas one has expressed are truly understood by another. Communication breakdowns happen in every part of the globe, and these have led to a plethora of problems. Effective communication can breach peace, spark revolutions, and affect change in government. However, to communicate properly, one cannot simply strive to express oneself and leave understanding to fate; one must also learn how to organize one's thoughts, control one's emotions, use one's words to articulate concepts and arguments, and express oneself in the best way possible. The art of one's communication reflects the art of one's thinking. According to James Berlin (1982), one of the major proponents of The New Rhetoric, "In teaching writing, we are not simply offering training in a useful technical skill that is meant as a simple complement to the more important studies of other areas. We are teaching a way of experiencing the world, a way of ordering and making sense of it" (776). This is also true when it comes to all the language skills essential in communication, whether this is in writing, reading. listening, or speaking. They are tools that help us analyze, critique, and negotiate with the world. To construct ideas and bring people to believe in one's vision, it is important to be able to communicate in an effective, articulate manner. On a personal level, honing one's communication skills can also bring about success to one's personal and professional life. To lead nations or corporations, communication skills are essential. To work smoothly as a team, communication is indispensable. And to create a vision that people will believe in, one needs to learn how to communicate purposefully in today's society. Questions: 1. What problems can happen when there are communication breakdowns? 2. What does Berlin mean when he says "(In teaching writing), we are teaching a way of experiencing the world, a way of ordering and making sense of it"? 3. Is this only true for writing? Explain.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>it's beautiful answer like and give me star I give u answer </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>breakdowns easy 5 star like</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Communication breakdowns can lead to a range of problems, such as misunderstandings, conflicts, missed opportunities, reduced productivity, and even the breakdown of relationships or the failure of organizations.</p><p>2. Berlin means that teaching writing is not just about teaching technical skills, but also about teaching a way of perceiving, organizing, and making sense of the world. Through writing, one can clarify and refine one's thoughts, develop critical thinking skills, and articulate complex ideas in a coherent and persuasive manner. Writing is thus a tool for understanding and engaging with the world, and for communicating one's ideas and perspectives to others.</p><p>3. No, this is not only true for writing. The same applies to all language skills, including reading, listening, and speaking. Each of these skills enables us to engage with the world in different ways and to communicate effectively with others. For example, reading can help us access and evaluate different sources of information, while listening can help us understand others' perspectives and build relationships. Effective communication thus requires proficiency in all language skills, as well as the ability to use them strategically in different contexts.</p><br />
