                        <p>Strong partnerships with families are built on good communication. Families will communicate their needs to you, and in turn, you will communicate what resources are available. Generating family and child information is a critical piece of your work as a preschool teacher. In the same way, sharing information with families about their children and their development can make or break the partnership between home and preschool. This lesson will highlight appropriate ways to collect information from families, as well as the ways and opportunities to share information in a caring, easy-to-understand way.</p><br />
