What I Have Learned
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire also confirmed the
development in a Viber message to reporters.
Teodoro said they are eyeing to open the testing center on Friday
morning as they still must complete the list of individuals who shall be
prioritized for the testing.
“It may open tomorrow morning. For tonight, we are still
finishing our list of priorities for testing. We will prioritize those with
COVID-19 symptoms, “he said when asked when the laboratory will be
opened for mass testing.
To date, Marikina City has 109 confirmed COVID-19 cases
including 22 patients who recovered and 18 deaths.Marikina City’s
molecular laboratory is located along Bayan Bayanan Avenue in
Barangay Concepcion Uno.
In this news the writer shows, the new testing center has a floor
area of 160 square meters and has no other offices sharing the
building.
The city government earlier planned to establish a testing site on
the sixth floor of Marikina City Health Office but DOH rejected the
proposal because it did not pass biosafety standards for molecular
laboratories that process COVID-19 test samples.</a>

The kids were children of a food delivery man. They will be brought to the Regional Hospital today for proper health care. Health officers of the region warned the community to practice proper hygiene. The community must wear face mask, observe social distancing and wash their hands regularly with soap and water. Parents were also oriented that they should take responsibility in monitoring their children. The barangay health workers may coordinate with the DOH regional office for further instructions to contain the virus from spreading. Failure to observe the proper protocol might result to a contagion in the barangay. The Local Government Unit issued a statement that anyone who shows symptoms of the virus should contact the hotlines or report directly to the Regional Hospital for appropriate health procedures and care.​</a>

What I Have Learned
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire also confirmed the
development in a Viber message to reporters.
Teodoro said they are eyeing to open the testing center on Friday
morning as they still must complete the list of individuals who shall be
prioritized for the testing.
“It may open tomorrow morning. For tonight, we are still
finishing our list of priorities for testing. We will prioritize those with
COVID-19 symptoms, “he said when asked when the laboratory will be
opened for mass testing.
To date, Marikina City has 109 confirmed COVID-19 cases
including 22 patients who recovered and 18 deaths.Marikina City’s
molecular laboratory is located along Bayan Bayanan Avenue in
Barangay Concepcion Uno.
In this news the writer shows, the new testing center has a floor
area of 160 square meters and has no other offices sharing the
building.
The city government earlier planned to establish a testing site on
the sixth floor of Marikina City Health Office but DOH rejected the
proposal because it did not pass biosafety standards for molecular
laboratories that process COVID-19 test samples.</h2><br />
