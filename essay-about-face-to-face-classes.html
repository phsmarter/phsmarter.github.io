One reason is that it includes a discussion of the lessons, outdoor activities, and performance tasks that allow students to interact with their classmates, there is group work, and immediate feedback. Based on headspace.org.au,  It's a great way to learn compared to distance learning which only provides reading and writing tasks. It also lacks immediate feedback. It's limiting the learner's interactions and creativity because every task is done at home. If there is one experience that I and my classmates would similarly say, it would be: "It's uncomfortable." Studying at home is extremely uncomfy, it is full of distractions. Besides, students are so done with distance learning modality. They're missing their friends. They want to experience celebrating teacher's day, Valentine's day, and Christmas day in school. The students enjoy learning more in face-to-face classes since there is a lack of social interaction in distance learning.</p>#CARRYONLEARNING<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As several local government units and private schools are requesting to hold limited face-to-face classes in low-risk areas, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte on Tuesday approved its conduct starting next year.
</p><p>
</p><p>This development came after the Department of Education (DepEd) received queries from local chief executives, legislators, private and international schools, and other education stakeholders on the possibility of conducting limited face-to-face classes in areas where it is deemed safe to do so by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) and the Department of Health (DOH).
</p><p>
</p><p>Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones noted that limited face-to-face classes will ONLY be allowed upon the request of the LGU and school concerned and can only happen January 2021 under conditions set by the DOH, DepEd and IATF.
</p><p>
</p><p>Moreover, it can only be considered in low-risk areas or in areas at least under Modified General Community Quarantine (MGCQ) or in the transition phase between GCQ and the New Normal.

</p><p>“Hindi para sa lahat ang face-to-face classes, [dahil] meron tayong standards. Hindi lahat ay pinipilit mag-[limited] face-to-face classes. Apat na agency ang magde-decide kung papayagan ba. Sa Metro Manila, medyo may kahirapan   [mag-conduct ng limited face-to-face classes]. Kasi GCQ ngayon sa Metro Manila. Although ang mga international schools, sabi nila, kaya nila ‘yong mga requirements ng departamento at ng IATF. Pero, sabi namin, kailangang inspeksiyunin namin ‘yong facility nila.” Secretary Briones said.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Education chief emphasized that decisions to allow limited, localized face-to-face classes will be made with due coordination between DepEd, the LGUs concerned, and the local health authorities.
</p><p>
</p><p>According to Briones, limited face-to-face classes will still be strictly regulated with the priority on the health and safety of learners, teachers, and personnel following stringent health measures such as the following:
</p><p>
</p><p>No mask, no entry policy in school premises;
</p><p>Hand washing and hand hygiene;
</p><p>Regular disinfection in school premises;
</p><p>Checking for temperature and respiratory symptoms;
</p><p>Reduction in class size to 15 to 20 maximum, and physical arrangement of seats conforming to required distances;
</p><p>Intermittent attendance to school only, to complement distance learning;
</p><p>Controls of flow of learners and personnel in entrance and exit;
</p><p>No mass gatherings;
</p><p>Visible instructions, signages and markings; and
</p><p>Preparedness and case management system in coordination with LGUs and local health for contact tracing, testing, isolation and treatment.
</p><p>In addition, host local government unit must be ready to support financially as well as in other ways the requirements for limited face to face learning.
</p><p>
</p><p>A small number of private schools which have started limited face-to-face classes last June will be allowed to continue however.
</p><p>
</p><p>Briones also stressed that before any face-to-face classes will be greenlighted in January next year, there will be pilot testing and inspection to be done jointly with the National Task Force Against COVID 19 to ensure that the required health standards and protocols are working, and possible glitches are addressed.</p><br />

                        Face to Face Classes<p></p><p>Individuals are required to attend school under the traditional <strong>face-to-face classes</strong> system, which is still employed in many states.<strong> Face-to-face learning is superior to online learning because there is less distraction and more opportunity for students to interact with their professors and fellow classmates</strong>. Since it enables teachers to pinpoint students' areas of weakness and devise strategies to support the learners in overcoming obstacles, interpersonal interaction between students and their instructors is essential. Teachers can mentor students in dealing with a variety of challenges they might come across in their professional domains and educate them about other facets of society. For instance, teachers can build strong bonds with kids, act as their counselors, and teach them moral principles, therefore, interpersonal communication between students and teachers is a crucial issue that is challenging to implement in online learning. </p><p></p><p>Students are encouraged to connect with others and develop social skills through <strong>face-to-face instruction</strong>. People all throughout the world hold a variety of beliefs and values.<strong> Learning about other cultures makes it easier for people to communicate with many different people in groups and in the community</strong>. It also aids in valuing and appreciating the backgrounds of others. Conflicts in the community have also been sparked by the subject of religion. Face-to-face instruction is essential because it allows kids to interact with peers of different faiths and teach them the value of respecting all religions. Additionally, it should be noted that in-person instruction covers matters such as cultural differences and other problems that people encounter in their communities in addition to academic performance.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>To know more about face to face classes, visit the link below:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/9763060 </strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a significant shift in the way education is delivered. Face-to-face classes have been replaced by online classes, and this shift has posed new challenges to students and educators alike. In this essay, we will examine the advantages and disadvantages of both face-to-face and online classes.<br /><br />Face-to-face classes have been the traditional way of delivering education. One of the main advantages of face-to-face classes is that they provide students with the opportunity to interact with their teachers and classmates in real-time. This type of interaction allows students to ask questions and receive immediate feedback, which can help them to better understand the material they are studying. It also provides students with the opportunity to collaborate with their peers, which can help to develop important social and teamwork skills.<br /><br />However, face-to-face classes also have some disadvantages. For example, they can be time-consuming and expensive, especially for students who have to travel long distances to attend classes. They can also be difficult to schedule, as students may have other commitments that make attending classes at a specific time difficult. Additionally, face-to-face classes may not be accessible to students with disabilities or those who live in remote areas.<br /><br />Online classes, on the other hand, have become increasingly popular in recent years. One of the main advantages of online classes is that they are more flexible than face-to-face classes. Students can access course materials and lectures at any time and from any location, as long as they have an internet connection. This makes it easier for students to balance their education with other commitments, such as work or family responsibilities.<br /><br />Online classes also have some disadvantages. For example, they can be isolating, as students do not have the same opportunities for social interaction as they would in a face-to-face class. Additionally, online classes require a certain level of self-discipline and motivation, as students are responsible for their own learning and must keep up with course materials and assignments on their own.<br /><br />In conclusion, both face-to-face and online classes have their advantages and disadvantages. Face-to-face classes provide students with the opportunity to interact with their teachers and classmates in real-time, but can be time-consuming and expensive. Online classes are more flexible and accessible, but can be isolating and require a higher level of self-discipline. Ultimately, the choice between face-to-face and online classes depends on the individual needs and preferences of the student.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: </strong><strong>Face-to-face learning is much better compared to online learning because, as the Stanford researchers found out, “in-person communications make our brains happier.” In a classroom setting, teachers can manage their topics very well because there is no longer a need to compress their topics to fit the modules.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: Sorry that's all i can do but i hope it helps</strong></p><p></p><br />
