Many are quick to say that will never happen to me, I am a pro at this, however I am sure the people who died from texting and driving said the same thing. We are a generation that is easily distracted, to some we are the technology generation our phones are the most important thing to us. Although you cherish your phone shouldn’t you cherish your lives even more? How are we concentrating on the road if we are using our phone.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The use of cell phones in schools has been a controversial topic for many years. Supporters argue that cell phones can be used as educational tools, while opponents believe that they can be a source of distraction for students.</p><p></p><p>While it is true that cell phones can provide access to educational resources, such as online textbooks and research databases, their potential to distract students is a significant concern. Cell phones can be a source of temptation for students to engage in non-educational activities, such as playing games or scrolling through social media. This can lead to a decline in academic performance and a disruption of class.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the use of cell phones in schools can create inequality among students who may not have access to the latest technology or may not be able to afford a cell phone. This could lead to a sense of exclusion and unfairness among students.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while the use of cell phones in schools can have some benefits, such as access to educational resources, the potential for distraction and inequality outweigh these benefits. Therefore, it is recommended that schools establish clear policies on the use of cell phones in the classroom to minimize their negative impact on students' academic performance and social dynamics.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Men Vs Women</p><p>             Men and Women are very different in many ways. Not only physically, but also emotionally, and mentally. Because of these differences, there is also a distinction in the way men or women are treated. When looking at the obvious facts that set males apart from females, it is quite clear to me that men definitely have the advantage. Not only do men have better builds than women, but men also do not have to go through certain changes throughout their lives like females do, such as menstruation. Also, men and women are treated very differently in society. Men are, in most cases, treated better, whether it is in the workplace or just out for leisure. Although there are some advantages to being a woman, such as not having to sign up for the draft, overall, the advantage is on the guys' side.</p><p>             First of all, men were made with bigger, stronger, and seemingly better bodies. The strongest man is, no doubt, stronger than the strongest woman, and the majority of men are built better, or tougher than the majority of women. A mans body can endure more than a woman's, and in our society being stronger, bigger, or tougher is a good thing and a goal for many people. Women are seen as being weak and unable to do things for themselves.</p><p>             Secondly, men do not undergo certain unpleasant events, or changes throughout their lifetime that women have to endure. For example, having a menstrual cycle, and dealing with your body constantly changing every month. Not to mention once that is over with, dealing with menopause. Also, men cannot give birth, which is one of the most painful experiences a woman will ever go through. There are many different changes that happen to a woman's body during puberty that men don't have to go through. That's not to say that men go through things that women don't go through, but things such as menstruation is something that will last beyond puberty. </p><br />
