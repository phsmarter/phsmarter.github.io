Weather they be to become a scientist and discover new and amazing things, or become a star basketball player and be the highest paid player in the league, people dream about their future. I have dreams for the future just like everyone else. Dreams of the good life, with lots of money, hot girls, and fast cars! And I will do whatever it takes to achieve it.After I have a doctorate, I plan to get a job working for a company under their research division. I hope I can lend a hand in finding new, more effective ways of administering drugs to patents. Or I could possibly design self-administration drugs for those at home type of people. Or perhaps I could improve packaging designs for the medication. The possibilities are endless!</p><p>             Outside of my job, I plan to buy a large home. I dream of settling down in an urban area, someplace that's not too big. A Stockton type of town, but not Stockton. Possibly Monterey or Carmel. Hopefully by the time I get a house, I'll have a wife and can start a family. I dream of having a son to carry on the family name.</p><p>             As you can see, I have big plans for my future. I plan to make something of myself, and not to give up. I have a major fear of failure, and I won't let it get to me. My parents expect a lot out of me, and I think I have done a good job so far. My dreams are what keep me going; they are an object for me to strive for. I will obtain that object one day. </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>MY GOALS FOR NOW IS TO BE A CHEF AND I WANT TO REACH MY DREAMS SO I CAN HELP MY PARENT</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>YUN LNG</p><br />

                            29. what are your plans?what are your goals or dreams?where do you see yourself 10 years from now?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Employers ask "Where do you see yourself in 10 years?" to see if you can grow with their company. They want to learn if your long-term goals align with those of the company. A candidate they can anticipate will stay awhile is a better investment than one they expect to leave after a year or less.
</p><p>
</p><p>That's why it's good to show you want to gain more experience in the role you're applying for and eventually get promoted to a higher-level position when you're ready. Show interviewers they should invest in your talent and skills and the payoff will be worth it for the company.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The answer most thought-inducing and appealing is no plan at all. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>We are not bound to know what'll happen in the future for we are in a world of boundless possibilities. Focus on making the present successful and see the beauty of tomorrow.</p><br />
