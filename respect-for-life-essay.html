                                            The Presidential Decree No. 474, Executive Order No. 125, as amended, Republic Act No. 9295 and its revised/amended Implementing Rules and Regulations, and the Manila Statement on Enhancement of the Safety of Ships Carrying Passengers on Non- International Voyages through MARINA Memorandum Circular No. 2016 - 02 provides the implementing rules on the phase out of wooden hulled ships carrying passengers in domestic shipping. However, it is very untimely to replace the wooden-hulled boats with the fiber glass and steel-hulled ones. First, the pandemic is still too far from over and life is not stable as before. Many Filipinos have lost their jobs because of this; much more the crews of the 91 wooden-hulled boats that were not allowed to sail again at the onset of 2021. Their means of living simply rely at whenever these boats set sail and traverse the lloilo-Guimaras Strait; this has been their only bread and butter for decades and with this halt in its operation, it will surely post a big impact as to their daily survival even on their basic needs and worst, the education of their children. It must have been painful for both operators, crews and their respective families to lose their source of living amidst this pandemic. Second, the phasing out of the wooden-hulled units was so abrupt that it even posted another problem affecting another set of people; the commuters, small-scale business folks situated at the wharf area and the tricycle drivers. The local government has not provided emergency ambulant boats to cater the volume of passengers; mostly to work and for education, that will be affected by the sudden stoppage of operations of the wooden-hulled units. Long hours were spent in queues with only four modernized boats plying the Iloilo-Guimaras Strait given the volume of passengers coming in and going out of the province. Additionally, with this turn of events, surely, the local economy is highly affected. Small businesses are directly affected by the increase in fare rate in hauling stocks and supplies from the city going to the province as compared with the wooden-hulled transport services. Also, daily commuters earning a minimum wage spares a bigger amount for fare than before; the thirty pesos before is now fifty and when you have to travel to and fro on a daily basis, that's at least a hundred bucks difference in a week! That's something already for them. a Lastly, how sure are we that with the modernized fiberglass and steel-hulled units, there will never be a tragedy at sea? Can we really say that there will never be? Much to our desire of accommodating the modernization program of the government, we must also consider those who will be greatly affected and device win-win situations so as not to forsake other people's welfare in every plight we take.

                                            Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</a>

Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W. Shwalb, Barbara J. Shwalbhttps://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/dshwalb/files/ CAD114Chapter1.pdfAfter reading the two excerpts above, answer the following questions.

                                            Friends can be classified according to their honesty, loyalty, the type that fits you into theirschedule, or the type that finds time for you when they need something. An honest friend tellsyou the truth even if it’s not always what you want to hear. In the long run, that honest friend mayhave saved you from embarrassment or possibly rejection. They give you constructivecriticisms overall. A loyal friend is the type of friend that will be there for you through thick andthin. They don’t care how good or bad you may look one day; they are sensitive to your feelings,they respect you and the other people in your life, and most of all they will never let you downwhen times are hard. They may be what you call a best friend. The third group, the person thatfits you into their schedule, is the type of person that is always on the go. They barely have timefor themselves let alone another person. More than likely they will not be there for you whenyou need them most, because they are so wrapped up in their busy, hectic life. Then you havethe self-absorbent type of friend that finds time for you only when they need something. Thistype of person isn’t what you would call a friend. This person may always be extremely nice toyou because they know that if they are nice to you then they will more than likely get what theywant. They will call you every once in a while when it is almost time for them to use that personagain. It may be for a ride to work, home or they just want somebody to hang out with becausethey have no other friends. If the person that is being used is smart they will eventually realizethat they are getting used and will stop being there for that person. 1. What are the three types of friends?2.

They  don’t  care  how  good  or  bad  you  may  look  one  day;  they  are  sensitive  to  your  feelings ,  they  respect  you  and  the  other  people  in  your  life,  and  most  of  all  they  will  never  let  you  down  when  times  are  hard.  They may  be  what  you  call  a  best  friend.  The  third  group,  the  person  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  is  the  type  of  person  that  is  always  on  the  go. They barely have  time  for  themselves  let  alone  another  person.  More  than  likely  they  will  not  be  there  for  you  when  you  need  them  most,  because  they  are  so  wrapped  up  in  their  busy  ,  hectic  life.  Then  you  have  the  self-absorbent  type of  friend  that  finds  time  for  you  only  when  they  need  something. This  type  of  person isn’t  what  you  would  call  a  friend.  This  person  may  always  be  extremely  nice  to  you  because  they  know  that from being nice they will more than likely get what they want. They  will call  you  every  once  in  a while  when  it is almost  time  for  them  to  use  that  person  again.  It  may  be  for  a  ride  to  work,  home  or  they  just  want  somebody  to  hangout  with  because  they  have  no  other  friends.  If  the  person  that  is  being  used  is  smart  they  will eventually  realize  that  they  are  getting  used  and  will  stop  being  there  for  that  person.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Hello everyone, I would like to share my views by writing this essay during this Covid-19 pandemic situation. My intention is to provide a personal stance of my experience. when i working in school, everybody in my school was talking about a current epidemic happening in china and it will by and by spread shortly after. I never think that epidemic will turn in to pandemic in a matter of weeks.</p><p></p><p>On March 2020,my assumption were wrong and everything has changed. Then we all realized that we were going to be in lockdown for a long time. When the sudden but essential lockdown was urge upon us ,whole nation was shaked. The hard thing is particularly hearing on the news that the elderly are more unsafe to the exposure of the Corona virus, </p><p></p><p></p><p>thought of losing my family members was horrified.

                            7. The Presidential Decree No. 474, Executive Order No. 125, as amended, Republic Act No. 9295 and its revised/amended Implementing Rules and Regulations, and the Manila Statement on Enhancement of the Safety of Ships Carrying Passengers on Non- International Voyages through MARINA Memorandum Circular No. 2016 - 02 provides the implementing rules on the phase out of wooden hulled ships carrying passengers in domestic shipping. However, it is very untimely to replace the wooden-hulled boats with the fiber glass and steel-hulled ones. First, the pandemic is still too far from over and life is not stable as before. Many Filipinos have lost their jobs because of this; much more the crews of the 91 wooden-hulled boats that were not allowed to sail again at the onset of 2021. Their means of living simply rely at whenever these boats set sail and traverse the lloilo-Guimaras Strait; this has been their only bread and butter for decades and with this halt in its operation, it will surely post a big impact as to their daily survival even on their basic needs and worst, the education of their children. It must have been painful for both operators, crews and their respective families to lose their source of living amidst this pandemic. Second, the phasing out of the wooden-hulled units was so abrupt that it even posted another problem affecting another set of people; the commuters, small-scale business folks situated at the wharf area and the tricycle drivers. The local government has not provided emergency ambulant boats to cater the volume of passengers; mostly to work and for education, that will be affected by the sudden stoppage of operations of the wooden-hulled units. Long hours were spent in queues with only four modernized boats plying the Iloilo-Guimaras Strait given the volume of passengers coming in and going out of the province. Additionally, with this turn of events, surely, the local economy is highly affected. Small businesses are directly affected by the increase in fare rate in hauling stocks and supplies from the city going to the province as compared with the wooden-hulled transport services. Also, daily commuters earning a minimum wage spares a bigger amount for fare than before; the thirty pesos before is now fifty and when you have to travel to and fro on a daily basis, that's at least a hundred bucks difference in a week! That's something already for them. a Lastly, how sure are we that with the modernized fiberglass and steel-hulled units, there will never be a tragedy at sea? Can we really say that there will never be? Much to our desire of accommodating the modernization program of the government, we must also consider those who will be greatly affected and device win-win situations so as not to forsake other people's welfare in every plight we take.

                            9. Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Covid-19 Shocked the entire world due to its sudden appearance, it caused chaos and panic among-st nations and governments. 2 years ago non of us imagined that we would be stuck in our homes in lock down yet here we are. It did massive economy damages in all countries and caused major problems and inconvenience to people. However and shined a light on a different point of view. It made us realize the the world is finite, our resources are not limitless and that we should learn and educate ourselves to respect those who work day and night to provide food and water for our nations. We should also thank those who constantly put their selves into danger and sacrifice their lives to find a cure to the current pandemic especially the doctors and front liners. Another thing the lock down taught us is that everything is temporary, Nothing stays the same for long  but when it changes doesn't mean it's gone. The lives that were lost during the pandemic were not in vain, and their legacy and memory will live on. Yes death is inevitable but we shouldn't dwell on what's to come but instead live in the moment and create memories as we go, cherish our loved ones because we will never what the future holds.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps &lt;3</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a lover of literature, I wholeheartedly agree with the statement that "literature adds reality." Literature has the unique ability to transport readers to different worlds, times, and experiences, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the complexities and nuances of human life.</p><p></p><p>But literature does more than just provide a temporary escape from reality. It also helps us to better understand and navigate the reality we live in. Through literature, we encounter diverse perspectives and ideas that broaden our understanding of the world and the people around us. We learn about different cultures, histories, and ways of life that we may not have been exposed to otherwise.</p><p></p><p>In this way, literature enriches the competencies that daily life requires. It helps us to develop empathy, critical thinking, and communication skills, as well as a greater awareness and understanding of the world. These are all essential skills that we rely on in our personal and professional lives.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, literature has the power to bring beauty and meaning to our lives, especially in times when life may feel mundane or monotonous. It can provide solace and comfort during difficult times, and offer new ways of looking at the world that can inspire and uplift us. In this sense, literature can "inigate the deserts" of our lives, bringing new life and vitality to our daily experiences.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, literature adds reality in a multitude of ways. It expands our understanding of the world and the people around us, enriches the competencies we need to navigate daily life, and brings beauty and meaning to our lives. Whether we are lost in a captivating novel or studying a classic work of literature, the power of literature to enrich and deepen our reality is undeniable.</p><p></p><p><strong> If you have any other questions,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>just </strong><strong>let </strong><strong>me </strong><strong>know</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Pa </strong><strong>brainliest </strong><strong>narin </strong><strong>ty</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>)</strong></p><br />

Compare the views of the author.From an essay...Respect is the first positive step in building a relationship and relationships are central to conflict transformation. One does not have to like a person or understand his viewpoint to accord him respect. Respect comes with the belief that a person or culture can have beliefs contradictory to ours and we should still honor them, as basic respect is a fundamental right of all human beings. In addition, goals and concessions become easier to attain when the element of respect is present As Bill Richardson, the US permanent representative to the UN put it. "You have to be a human being. You cannot be arrogant... If you treat each individual with respect, each nation with dignity, you can get a lot further than trying to muscle them". ""Excerpt quoted from. Respect by Sana Farid https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/respectFrom a research paper...eeWe believe that respectful children and adolescents tend to become respectful, civil, and tolerant adults. Conversely, we assume that the origins of incivility, disrespect, intolerance, and other problems of adults are formed in childhood and adolescence. For example, lacking respect for parents or authorities, a young child may not be receptive to what one can learn at home or at school. Brought up to disrespect other people based on social status or race, a child may become prejudiced. With a lack of respect for oneself, an adolescent may develop a negative self-concept and a lack of respect for others. Growing up with disrespect for older people, a young adult may be unable to keep a job in the work world that requires understanding the authority of others. Respect and disrespect indeed have relevance across the entire life span, for instance, in respect for the elderly and respect for the dignity of the dying.""Excerpt quoted from: Research and Theory on Respect and Disrespect: Catching Up with the Public and Practitioners by David W.

They don’t care how good or bad you may look one day; they are sensitive to your feelings,they respect you and the other people in your life, and most of all they will never let you downwhen times are hard. They may be what you call a best friend. The third group, the person thatfits you into their schedule, is the type of person that is always on the go. They barely have timefor themselves let alone another person. More than likely they will not be there for you whenyou need them most, because they are so wrapped up in their busy, hectic life. Then you havethe self-absorbent type of friend that finds time for you only when they need something. Thistype of person isn’t what you would call a friend. This person may always be extremely nice toyou because they know that if they are nice to you then they will more than likely get what theywant. They will call you every once in a while when it is almost time for them to use that personagain. It may be for a ride to work, home or they just want somebody to hang out with becausethey have no other friends.
