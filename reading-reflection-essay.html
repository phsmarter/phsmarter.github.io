The reflective essay should have a minimum of 250 words but not exceeding 500 words.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A book that has made a huge impact on my life and falls under the fantasy genre is "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien. This epic tale of adventure and heroism has captured my imagination and inspired me in countless ways.</p><p></p><p>The world that Tolkien created in "The Lord of the Rings" is a rich and complex one, filled with fascinating characters, imaginative creatures, and breathtaking landscapes. The journey of the hobbits, Frodo and Sam, as they venture to destroy the One Ring and defeat the evil Sauron, is an epic tale of bravery and determination. Their friendship, along with the camaraderie and loyalty of the other members of the Fellowship of the Ring, is a beautiful example of the power of teamwork and the bonds of friendship.</p><p></p><p>One of the things that I admire most about "The Lord of the Rings" is the way that it explores the themes of good and evil, and the choices that individuals must make in the face of those forces. The characters in the book are not simply good or evil, but rather complex individuals who must make difficult decisions and face the consequences of those choices. This complexity is what makes the story so captivating and relatable, as it mirrors the real-life struggles that we all face in our own lives.</p><p></p><p>In addition to its imaginative world and complex characters, "The Lord of the Rings" has also had a profound impact on me because of its underlying message of hope and perseverance. Despite the many challenges and obstacles that the characters face, they never give up on their quest, and they always strive to do what is right, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. This has inspired me to be more resilient in the face of challenges and to never give up on my own goals and dreams.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>R.A 9003, R.A 9275, and R.A 8749 are three important Republic Acts in the Philippines that aim to address environmental concerns in the country. R.A 9003 or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 focuses on proper waste disposal and management, promoting the 3R approach - Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle - to minimize waste and pollution. R.A 9275 or the Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004 aims to protect the country's water resources, ensuring that bodies of water are free from pollution and contaminants. Finally, R.A 8749 or the Philippine Clean Air Act of 1999 seeks to improve air quality by regulating emissions from industries and vehicles, among other sources.</p><p></p><p>These Republic Acts are crucial in promoting sustainable development in the Philippines. They provide a framework for the government, industries, and citizens to work together in preserving and protecting the environment. However, their effectiveness also relies on proper implementation and enforcement. As citizens, we have a responsibility to be aware of these laws and to do our part in preserving the environment for future generations. We can start by practicing proper waste disposal, conserving water, and reducing our carbon footprint. By working together towards a cleaner and healthier environment, we can ensure a better future for ourselves and for the planet.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps :))</p><br />

Glaucon’s proposal implies that we are essentially self-interested and amoral. We act morally not because morality fulfills our natures but because we have no other alternative.In responding to Glaucon’s contractarian view Plato proposes an alternative view of human nature to that of the contractarians. We are, Plato will maintain, ultimately only fulfilled as human beings by being virtuous. Justice is thus intrinsically preferable to injustice. Indeed, Plato seems in general to underline Socrates’ view that care for the soul is our fundamental good. The only real harm is harm to the soul.</strong></p><br />

It provides ventilation to the Earth, as the atmosphere filters the ultraviolet rays, coming from the Sun. Thus, it acts as the Earth's protective armour without which all living things in the world would die. The ozone layer is a matter of tremendous concern as it profoundly influences the environmental conditions on the planets surface. The Atmosphere provides the air we breathe, the food we eat, the water we drink and above all it supports LIFE.</p><p></p><p>Atmosphere is very imperative to sustain life on Earth. To protect the atmosphere it is possible and simple, avoid polluting the air and water basically. Fight global warming by planting more trees and keeping your surrounding clean. You can reduce fuel consumption by using energy efficient appliances. We can preserve the atmosphere by practicing and encouraging good hygiene, reducing green house gases and emissions that are going into the air. Thus there are several solutions and ways that we can practice to protect the Earth's atmosphere.

Well, it turns out that reading helps in almost every area of smarts. Those that read have higher GPA’s, higher intelligence, and general knowledge than those that don’t. In Anne E. Cunningham’s paper What Reading Does for the Mind (pdf version), she found that reading, in general, makes you smarter, and it keeps you sharp as you age.</p><p></p><p>No matter what you’re wanting to do or become, you can’t do it without more knowledge. Reading is an excellent way to get where you’re wanting to go.</p><p></p><p>2. Reading reduces stress</p><p>When I’m reading a book, my mind shifts gears. Where I might have a had a stressful day, a book can easily distract me. Fiction is fantastic for this. Reading an awesome fiction book is perfect right before bed time. Though sometimes it’s hard to put the book down if it’s really good. Still, you’ll be relaxed ;)</p><p></p><p></p><p>3. Greater tranquility</p><p>Reading can soothe like no other. Given that I’m a pretty high-energy person, reading forces me to sit and be still. This daily act of making myself be quiet and still has been nothing short of miraculous for my anxiety and my “fidgety factor”.</p><p></p><p>Lisa Bu has a fantastic TED talk about how reading can open you mind. It’s only 6 minutes and well worth a watch.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>4. Improved analytical thinking</p><p>That’s right, ladies and germs. Cunningham’s studies have found that analytical thinking is boosted by reading. Readers improve their general knowledge, and more importantly are able to spot patterns quicker. If you can spot patterns quicker, your analytical skills receive a boost.</p><p></p><p>5. Increased vocabulary</p><p>It’s no secret that reading increases your vocabulary and improves your spelling, but did you know that reading increases your vocabulary more than talking or direct teaching? Reading forces us to look at words that we might not have seen or heard recently at the pub. In fact, language in children’s books are likely to be more sophisticated than your average conversation.</p><p></p><p>Increased vocabulary is especially crucial for bloggers or writers. All successful writers will tell you that in order to write well, you need to read. Every day. You’ll be surprised at the words you start incorporating into your writing.</p><p></p><p>A beefier vocabulary isn’t just for writers though. Knowing what other people are saying and using the perfect words to convey your feelings is a critical part of being a better human. Better listeners are more successful in life.</p><p></p><p>6. Improved memory</p><p>I have an awful memory. Just ask my fiancee. I usually can’t remember what I’ve eaten for breakfast, let alone things like names and address. Yet I’ve been finding that I can remember stuff much easier when I’ve been reading consistently. Do I have any scientific data to match this up? Not really. But I’d say it’s a pretty safe bet that reading has somehow given me memory mojo.</p><p></p><p>7. Improved writing skills</p><p>This isn’t much of a stretch, considering that reading improves vocabulary and critical thinking. I feel like a better writer, as I’m constantly surrounding myself with works from people who are better than me. That’s why English classes in High School make you read “the classics”. That’s why art students learn to copy masterpieces, so they know what creating something incredible should feel like.</p><p></p><p>The more you read, the better of a writer you’ll become.</p><p></p><p>8. Helps prioritize goals</p><p>Many times we’re certain we know what we “really want” in life. Yet I’ve found that activities like reading show me things I didn’t know about myself. My mind will drift to things that I’d really like to do, and it isn’t long that these little lapses in reading start to cycle. The same sort of goals keep popping into my head, allowing me to see what I really want to do.</p><p></p><p>For example, I’ve been playing music on a consistent basis, but I’ve always wanted to produce and distribute my own music. As I’ve been reading, I’ve found that song ideas and other general thoughts on music keep popping into my head. It’s my times reading that have really pushed me into giving music a serious go.</p><p></p><p>When you remove yourself from your work environment, you’ll start to see things that you might really want to do, that you’re not doing yet. Reading gives you a chance for your mind to wander.</p><p></p><p>use this note Sana makatulong☺️</p><br />

                        <p>Answer :</p><p></p><p></p><p>The statement "The more short stories or articles you read every day, the better you will become" is indeed true. Every story and/or articles have there own unique messages and lessons. Just like the story of cupid and psyche, it tells us about the power of love. The story of Icarus and Daedalus tells us not to be greedy in power or in control, to always listen to what our parents/elders says and not be arrogant and ignorant. While articles ,might not give us lessons always like short stories and/or stories, it makes us know about current issues and happenings in our nation. Just like how we become updated about the covid-19 pandemic,we read articles.</p><p></p><p>See one can learn many lessons and hear unique messages from short stories and articles, so imagine how knowledgeable and how much better a person can be in just reading everyday. </p><p></p><p><strong>Hope </strong><strong>it'll </strong><strong>help</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Indeed, I believe that the destructive nature of society has to do with human intelligence. The inventions, doings, actions, and apathetic attitude of humans, destroys our planet. Humans impact the physical environment in many ways, like overpopulation, pollution, burning fossil fuels, and deforestation. Changes like these have triggered climate change, soil erosion, poor air quality, and undrinkable water. But also, human intelligence can overcome all of this through their efforts and inventions. People limiting the use of fossil fuels such as oil, carbon, and natural gas and replacing them with renewable and cleaner sources of energy, all while increasing energy efficiency. They also plant trees, do charities to help the environmental issues, and invent more. Therefore, human intelligence can both benefit us and destroy us, it just matters who'll outweigh who</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>(&gt; &lt;)</p><br />

                        <p>This thought me to do what is right. By doing the right thing you tend to get the same things back.
