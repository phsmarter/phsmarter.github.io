                        <p><strong>THE MYSTERIOUS  BOY</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>As he climbed the steep hill, he heard an earthly wail sending a shiver down his spine. A metal foot heaved itself onto the soft, squelchy surface of the muddy soil. It echoed through his ear drums, haunting his future nightmares. It was like the undead bursting out of the ground. Seconds later, it did. Black, bony zombies with orange flashes pouring off them like blood. Rapiers being gripped in their palms.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>His clothes were sodden. A low din echoed through the trees.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>A burst of black sparks erupted from the ground. Noise surrounded him. A mix of grunts and clangs filled his ear drums. All of the metal objects were holding rapiers that were visibly moulding. Then they started falling like they had been shot in the back. Then he just stood there, breath baited.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Jack was an ordinary ten year old, loved video games, went to school, but a few years ago, on holiday to The Alps, he fell off his ski cart landing on a pile of soft, white snow – never to be seen again.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>After that, he was forced to survive in the forests of Switzerland. He had brown hair that spiked up at the front. He had scratches, cuts, bruises and mud all over his body. Jack had been on the news and a search team had come out to find him but they hadn’t succeeded.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Jack had an older brother and two younger sisters. His youngest sister hadn’t been born before Jack had fallen and the oldest sister had only been 1 and his brother was 5. Now he was fighting robots.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Just after the robots had fallen, a black figure had appeared from behind an oak tree. A mask covered his face and he was holding a gun. Then as soon as he was there he was gone, turned to thin air.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Jack sat up.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I think that history is relevant today because it gives us a deeper understanding of the world around us. It can help us understand the different countries, cultures and races that make up our society, as well as the people who have come before us.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why history is important today is because it provides us with an opportunity to learn from our mistakes. We learn from past mistakes so that we don't repeat them in the future. By having an understanding of how others have navigated through difficult situations at different times in history, we can avoid making the same mistakes ourselves.</p><p></p><p>History also helps us understand what motivates people to do certain things or act in certain ways. For example, if we want to understand why people are willing to go to war, we can look back at previous wars and see how they were fought or what caused them to happen in the first place. Knowing this information will help us better understand why wars happen today or how they'll likely play out in the future if one breaks out again between nations with similar interests or goals (such as power).</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>YUNG MATINO NA SAGOT PLS </p><p></p><p>PLS ANSWER THE QUESTION I NEED THE ANSWERS NOW ASAP THE DEADLINE IS 6:30 PM PLSSS I NEED ANSWER ASAP.</p><p></p><p>Prize for correct answer: </p><p>5pts </p><p>brainliest </p><p>following </p><p>heart </p><p>i will help you with your assignments </p><p></p><p>wrong answer - </p><p>report answer</p><p>report account </p><p></p><p>PLS ANSWER MY QUESTIONS IN MY PROFILE</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Pro's of nuclear power plant</strong></p><p></p><p>Nuclear is the largest source of clean power in the United States. It generates nearly 800 billion kilowatt hours of electricity each year and produces more than half of the nation’s emissions-free electricity. This avoids more than 470 million metric tons of carbon each year, which is the equivalent of removing 100 million cars off of the road.</p><p></p><p>The thermal energy from nuclear reactors may also be used to decarbonize other energy-intensive sectors such as transportation – the largest contributor to carbon pollution.</p><p></p><p>Most Reliable Energy Source</p><p></p><p>Nuclear power plants run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They are designed to operate for longer stretches and refuel every 1.5 – 2 years. In 2019, nuclear plants operated at full power more than 92% of the time, making it the most reliable energy source on the grid today.</p><p></p><p>Creates Jobs</p><p></p><p>The nuclear industry supports nearly half a million jobs in the United States and contributes an estimated $60 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product each year.  U.S. nuclear plants can employ up to 700 workers with salaries that are 30% higher than the local average. They also contribute billions of dollars annually to local economies through federal and state tax revenues.</p><p></p><p>Supports National Security</p><p></p><p>A strong civilian nuclear sector is essential to U.S. national security and energy diplomacy. The United States must maintain its global leadership in this arena to influence the peaceful use of nuclear technologies. The U.S. government works with countries in this capacity to build relationships and develop new opportunities for the nation’s nuclear technologies.</p><p></p><p>Source: energy.com</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is common in every countries that not all products are made by themselves. Because Philippines is an island country, there are several limitations to produce themselves. Even if it is made in Philippines, raw materials will be from abroad. All countries have these kind of systems that every resources will not be available with them. So it is normal to borrow from others.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Example of a Stressful Incident and Its Stages of Stress Response</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, I had a major project due for one of my courses in college. I had spent weeks researching and writing the paper, but as the deadline approached, I began to feel overwhelmed and anxious. On the day the paper was due, my computer crashed, and I lost all my progress. This incident triggered the three stages of the stress response: the alarm stage, the resistance stage, and the exhaustion stage.</p><p></p><p>The alarm stage is the first stage of the stress response. It is also known as the fight or flight response. When I realized that I had lost all my progress on the paper, my body went into a state of shock. My heart rate increased, and I began to sweat. My brain released hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which prepared me to either fight the problem or run away from it.</p><p></p><p>The resistance stage is the second stage of the stress response. It occurs when the stressor persists, and the body continues to respond to it. In my case, I had to decide what to do next. I could either give up on the project or start over. I chose to start over, which meant working long hours and sacrificing sleep and other activities. This stage is characterized by continued release of stress hormones, which can lead to physical and mental exhaustion if prolonged.</p><p></p><p>The exhaustion stage is the third and final stage of the stress response. It occurs when the body can no longer cope with the stressor, and it begins to break down. In my case, after weeks of stress and anxiety, I finally completed the project. However, I was physically and mentally exhausted. I had trouble sleeping, and I experienced headaches and other physical symptoms. This stage can lead to long-term health problems if not managed properly.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the three stages of the stress response – alarm, resistance, and exhaustion – are a natural and normal response to stressful situations. However, prolonged exposure to stress can lead to physical and mental health problems. In my case, the stress of the project caused me to experience physical symptoms and exhaustion. It is important to be aware of the stages of stress response and to take steps to manage stress effectively, such as through exercise, relaxation techniques, and seeking support from friends or mental health professionals.</p><p></p><p></p><p>note: follow and mark me Brainliest for more answers </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Science and Technology</p><p>Science informs technological advancements. We rely on theories on physics, material science, electricity, chemistry, etc to develop new technologies. Indeed, we’re still working to create a lot of potentially useful materials that are predicted to exist, based on our current scientific theories, and the more scientific theory develops, the more it can inform our technological advancements. Our ability to create such powerful computers is informed by our science. Quantum computers are being developed, based on our science on the topic, which will further our computing power by orders of magnitude.</p><p>But technology also changes how we do science. Think about the invention of the telescope. It vastly changed our ability to conduct astronomical research. Space telescopes, probes like Voyager, the Cassini probe and the Huygens lander, etc have done even more. Even more recently, technological advancements have allowed us to create a virtual telescope the size of the Earth, which has allowed us to actually photograph a black hole (or really the material around it).</p><p>I happened to pick astronomy as an example, but the influence technology has had on science is — well — astronomical. Computing power, storage capacity, and so on has allowed for data science and the use of big data in medical sciences, sociology, economics, and more. So the very computers that are being developed, using scientific theory and evidence, also help us do scientific research.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Use concrete examples from news bulletins and other reports to support your arguments. The main question that you need to address is this: how effective was the collaboration of the Philippine government and nonstate institutions in responding to the needs of the survivors of typhoons Yolanda?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda) made landfall in the Philippines on 8 November 2013. Just over a year on, this article reflects on what the World Health Organisation (WHO)  the co-lead for the health cluster alongside the Philippines Department of Health (DoH)  has learnt, how these lessons have influenced the response over time and what this means for responses to health emergencies in the future. The article is based on internal information from WHOs own work, though it is hoped that the main findings will also be useful to other agencies.</p><p></p><p>Responding to multiple disasters</p><p></p><p>The first lesson is that national agencies and the international community need to be ready to respond to multiple natural disasters each year in the Philippines. The country is one of the worlds most disaster-prone. Typhoon Haiyan was the third crisis to hit the country in two months, following conflict in Zamboanga and an earthquake in Bohol, which combined displaced 750,000 people. This meant that response services including national and international agencies and the Philippine army were already stretched.</p><p></p><p>WHO Philippines has been working with the DoH to set up Emergency Operations Centres in vulnerable areas of the country, and to establish a gold, silver and bronze command system+</p><p> to direct disaster responses. The agency has also been restocking and pre-positioning medical supplies and equipment in anticipation of more natural disasters, and is developing toolkits with the DoH for emergency preparedness. These toolkits will provide guidance on procedures and practices to ensure a quick response in the aftermath of an emergency. Both national and local governments are working to ensure that health structures are disaster resilient.</p><br />

                            19. ESSAY 
1. Why is the recognition of human rights?
2. The oldest written rules for human rights maybe considered is have come from different religious writings. What do you think is the relationships between religion and human rights?
3. In your own words, explain the golden rule in 500 words and give an example.
4. How does the bill of rights of article 3 of the 1987 constitution affect you as an individual and your family as a whole.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The recognition of human rights is important to uphold the values of fairness, respect and dignity for each individual, regardless of culture, ethnicity, race, nationality, gender, or age. Human rights are granted to ensure that all individuals are treated with respect and allowed the same opportunity to thrive. The recognition of human rights is necessary to protect individuals from violations of their rights, including physical and sexual abuse, discrimination, denial of basic needs, unrestricted migration, and oppression. It is also essential to maintain international stability and to preserve peace and security between nations.</p><p></p><p>2. There is a strong relationship between religion and human rights in that many religious teachings emphasize the importance of respecting individual rights and treating others with respect and compassion. The teachings of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, for example, all emphasize that people should strive to treat others with dignity and utmost respect. This can be seen in the Golden Rule: "love your neighbor as yourself." In addition, many religious systems recognize the inherent rights of individuals to free speech, religious practice, and self-determination, which are also human rights recognized in modern legal systems.</p><p></p><p>3. The Golden Rule is an ethical principle that provides an invaluable lesson on how to treat others: to treat others as you would want them to treat you. This simple rule can be found in many religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam. It is commonly expressed as “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” and encourages people to act in the same manner that they would want others to act towards them. The importance of this rule lies in the fact that it involves taking into consideration the feelings of others and being considerate towards them, instead of simply doing whatever you want.</p><p></p><p>As an example of the Golden Rule, consider the following scenario: imagine you are walking down the street, and you notice someone in need of assistance. If you applied the Golden Rule in this situation, you would stop and take the time to help the person, considering that if the situation was reversed, you would expect someone else to help you. By treating others kindly and lending a helping hand when necessary, you will experience the rewards of showing and receiving kindness.</p><p></p><p>4. Article 3 of the 1987 Constitution states that the Filipino people have certain unalienable rights, and that protecting and promoting these rights is the duty of the government. This includes the right to life and liberty, the right to due process and protection from arbitrary arrest and punishment, the right to freedom of speech and assembly, the right to vote, the right to education, and the right to property and security. </p><p></p><p>For individual citizens and families, this means that these rights are guaranteed to them and should not be violated. This provides families with security and assurance that the government is looking out for their best interests. For example, the right to vote ensures that individuals and families have a say in choosing their leaders, which can have a direct impact on their lives. The right to due process gives individuals a fair trial, allowing them to hear the charges against them and have the opportunity to defend themselves in court. These rights also ensure better protection from discrimination, oppression, and arbitrary punishment. In essence, Article 3 of the 1987 Constitution provides legal protection to individuals and their families, allowing them to live and flourish in a stable and just environment.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Although most people do not understand how valuable time is until they lost it. Besides, there are people in the world who prioritize money over time because according to them, time is nothing. But, they do not realize the fact that it is time that has given them the opportunity to earn money. Apart from this, the time has given us prosperity and happiness and on the contrary, it has also given us sorrow and grief.</p><p></p><p>Power of Time</p><p>In previous time many kings proclaim themselves as the ruler of their age and all. But, they forget that they have limited time. Time is the only thing in the world that is limitless. Time can make you a king or a beggar in a movement of seconds.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, we can say that time is the greatest gift of God. Moreover, there is a saying that “if you waste time, time will waste you.” Only this line is enough to justify how important and valuable time is.</p><p></p><p>BROWSE</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Explicit describes something that is very clear and without vagueness or ambiguity. Implicit often functions as the opposite, referring to something that is understood, but not described clearly or directly, and often using implication or assumption.The main difference between implicit and explicit is that implicit refers to something that is implied but not said directly, whereas explicit refers to something is that stated directly.<p>Implicit and explicit are two adjectives that most people tend to use interchangeably. However, these are antonyms, i.e., they have opposing means. When something is implicit, it is only suggested, but not directly expressed. However, when something is explicit, it is directly and clearly expressed. Thus, we cannot use these two words, interchangeably.</p><p></p><p>Key Areas Covered</p><p>1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Social and economic factors, such as income, education, employment, community safety, and social supports can significantly affect how well and how long we live. These factors affect our ability to make healthy choices, afford medical care and housing, manage stress, and more.</p><p></p><p>The social and economic opportunities we have, such as good schools, stable jobs, and strong social networks are foundational to achieving long and healthy lives. For example, employment provides income that shapes choices about housing, education, child care, food, medical care, and more. In contrast, unemployment limits these choices and the ability to accumulate savings and assets that can help cushion in times of economic distress.</p><p></p><p>Social and economic factors are not commonly considered when it comes to health, yet strategies to improve these factors can have an even greater impact on health over time than those traditionally associated with health improvement, such as strategies to improve health behaviors.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Everyday</strong></p><br />
