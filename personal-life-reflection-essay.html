By the end of 2009, it was approximated that 34 million people were living with the HIV virus and deaths related to AIDS were about 1.8 million people. HIV/AIDS has been the worst pandemic since its discovery; having claimed over twenty five million lives by 2005 with the Sub- Saharan Africa being the most affected (Douek, Roederer &amp; Koup, 2009). This paper focuses on the impact – psychosocial, cultural and economic of HIV/AIDS and its related sexual health problems on the individual as well as the community. HIV/AIDS has a huge impact on the infected individual’s family unit and the community they live in. The impact is dependent on the mode in which the virus is transmitted among communities (and who it infects), the diagnosis of infection, and the community setting in which the individual and family live.</p><p></p><p>FollowMeForeMore</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:Of all of the common assumptions that we discussed in class, I think one of the most common is the idea that a children’s text should in some way teach the reader something.  We of course talked about the term didactic, and how a didactic book strongly pushes a lesson onto the reader, telling them that they should believe this or that.  Many times a reason for that lesson isn’t even given, as though the young person reading the book should just accept that lesson because they are told to, because the other knows better.  As I was reading Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss, the book I selected for the assignment, I was hoping that it wouldn’t be as didactic as most other children’s books, and that it would be as playful and exciting as I remember as a child.  On the last two pages of the book, however, the absent mother returns home, the cat has disappeared, the children are behaving nicely, sitting in chairs, and it is pretty obvious that even though they got into mischief they are still good children after all.  Nothing really has changed at the end of the book.  Although all sorts of things got played with, and the children broke the rules I am sure they know about (like, “Don’t fly kites in the house”), major boundaries were never crossed.  </strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>            We talked about how the opposite of a didactic book might be an ambiguous book, or a book that encourages the reader to think about issues, to make decisions for themselves.  In that kind of book, the author usually wants to the reader to think for her or himself, to understand that some things are difficult, even for adults.  The author may present a problem and ask you what you think, or might just never come around to saying exactly what you are supposed to believe.  The last page of Cat in the Hat ends with the narrator saying, referring to the mother, “Should we tell her about it? / Now what SHOULD we do? / Well . . . / What would YOU do / If your mother asked you?” (61).  In some ways, this is probably a pretty ambiguous ending.  The author asks the reader that if your mother left, if someone wanted you to do what you weren’t supposed to, if you did it anyway, and if you didn’t get caught, then would you tell your mother or father what happened?  Most adults wouldn’t tell what happened themselves, but the question is there anyway, and it seems to be really asking children what they believe.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Lemon Tree</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>
</p>Lemon Tree
<p>By Fool’s Garden
</p><p>
</p><p>Whilst its catchy tune, the song bears a sad meaning. For me, it delves into subjects of nihilism (nothingness), pessimism (being negative or sad), and a little optimism (hopefulness). In the lyrics, the recurring anthem or words are something about change in which it doesn’t happen. The character in the song, whether the singer or just simply a character, muses into his daily activities where everything is just the same and that there is nothing that he can do.  </p><p>
</p><p>I believe the character is experiencing a jaded state of mind. This is a situation wherein a person does everything to change or develop something but ends up failing.  The conclusion, he feels jaded, lethargic, and hopeless. The lemon tree is not a typical metaphor, but usually people take it as a sign for bitterness (lemon is acid, sour, bitter, and a lemon tree has lots of lemons), and so it would stand for sadness, pessimism, the opposite of blue sky. However, there is still a light at the end of the tunnel. In fact, "lemon" is used as a symbol for bitterness, sad things, in the common expression: "when life gives you lemons... make lemonade", which means, when something bad happens to you, try to make something good out of it.  </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/9076847</p><br />

Why do you think so? 2. Can you share your personal experiences or observations about this issue? 3.How does poverty affect you, your family, and the community in general? 4.in your opinion, how can poverty be lessened?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Poverty is a complex and multifaceted issue that affects individuals, families, and communities. It is a socio-economic problem that belongs to the larger issue of social inequality. Poverty is often linked to various issues such as unemployment, lack of education, and inadequate access to basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare. It is a systemic issue that affects millions of people around the world, and it requires a comprehensive and sustained effort to address it.</p><p></p><p>2. Growing up in a developing country, I have seen firsthand how poverty can impact families. I have seen families struggle to put food on the table, send their children to school, and provide basic healthcare. Many families are forced to live in cramped and unhygienic conditions, which leads to health issues. Children in poverty are also at risk of malnutrition, which can have long-term effects on their physical and mental health. Poverty can cause immense stress on families, leading to mental health issues and relationship breakdowns.</p><p></p><p>3. Poverty has a significant impact not only on individuals and families but also on the community in general. It can lead to social exclusion, crime, and violence. Poverty creates a vicious cycle, making it difficult for individuals and families to break free from its grip. To lessen poverty, we need a multi-faceted approach that addresses the root causes of poverty. This approach should include measures such as improving access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. We also need to provide social safety nets and support for those who are most vulnerable, including children, the elderly, and those with disabilities. Addressing poverty requires a collaborative effort between governments, non-governmental organizations, and individuals to create sustainable solutions that can lead to positive change in society.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes. As we all know, knowledge is a weapon for us to change the world. If we are knowledgeable, we can think critically and logically, make decisions wisely, and do thing properly. Moreover, our knowledge helps us to empower ourselves to fight ignorance. For instance, you are being asked about something, and you have knowledge about it. Then, you are confident enough to answer them the best of your ability and give them good impression. Knowledge is power wherein it will help you aim success and triumph.</p><br />
