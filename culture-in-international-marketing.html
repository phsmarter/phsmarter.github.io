                        <p>Starbucks used three different entry mode strategies to internationalize: joint venture, licensing and wholly-owned subsidiaries (Starbucks.com 2008). We have chosen three countries; each one represents one of three Starbucks' international strategies.</p>The internationalization strategy of Starbucks involves using three approaches which wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, and licensing. The licensing procedure is used when Starbucks wants quick expansion in a particular country.<br /><br />It is so successful because it was able to provide an experience that changed how much of the world thought about coffee shops and how many of us drink coffee outside of our homes. Starbucks created a third place between home and work where people can relax, enjoy a cup of coffee and experience the inviting ambience.<br /><br />Starbucks use their coffee beans not only to make coffee, they also diversify to use coffee beans to make other products and Starbucks can use the same raw material to produce different products to get more revenue.<br />
