                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>On the contrary, online games have produced a lot of negative effects on their mental and physical development. "By doing so, the children will do minimum physical activity which further leads to numerous health issues such as obesity, cardiac problems and psychological problems.</p><br />

                            2. argumentative essay about for banning online games ​​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>The increasing popularity of online gaming has been a major source of concern for parents, educators, and health care professionals. Many people have argued for banning online games, citing various reasons such as addictive behavior, cyberbullying, and inappropriate content. While there are valid arguments for banning online games, a complete ban is not necessary.</p><p></p><p>Addictive behavior is one of the biggest concerns regarding online gaming. People who play online games often become obsessed with the game and can lose track of time and neglect important responsibilities. This can lead to psychological issues such as depression and anxiety. While there are ways to mitigate these risks, such as setting time limits and monitoring game usage, banning online games completely is an extreme measure that is not necessary.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why people have argued for banning online games is cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is a serious issue and can have serious consequences. Online gaming can provide an environment where bullies can harass other players without consequences. While this is a valid concern, there are ways to combat cyberbullying without a complete ban. For instance, game developers can implement strict policies regarding online conduct and can take action against those who violate these policies.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, many people have argued that online games contain inappropriate content. While some games do contain explicit content, this is not the case for all games. In fact, many online games are designed for children and are appropriate for all age groups. Therefore, a complete ban on online games is not necessary.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while there are valid arguments for banning online games, a complete ban is not necessary. Instead, game developers should take steps to mitigate the risks associated with online gaming, such as cyberbullying and addiction. Furthermore, parents should also be aware of the games their children are playing and ensure that they are age-appropriate. By taking these measures, online gaming can be enjoyed safely and responsibly.</p><br />

                        I’ll answer the first topic which is “Should school be taught online instead of in a classroom?”<br /><br />To answer that question in my personal opinion, no.<br /><br />You see, there are a lot of benefits regarding studying at school more than online. You see your friends more, and interact socially with people, and you absorb more knowledge that way since a teacher is teaching you. Not self taught or whatever. You can also go to different rooms whenever you have different classes which I think kind of contributes to getting fit. There’s really countless reasons on why Offline Classes &gt; Online Classes<br /><br /><br />This is my personal opinion, hope it helps.

When we benefit from CT scanners, M.R.I. devices, pacemakers and arterial stents, we can immediately appreciate how science affects the quality of our lives. When we assess the state of the world, and identify looming challenges like climate change, global pandemics, security threats and diminishing resources, we don’t hesitate in turning to science to gauge the problems and find solutions.</p><p></p>And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hovering on the horizon—stem cells, genomic sequencing, personalized medicine, longevity research, nanoscience, brain-machine interface, quantum computers, space technology—we realize how crucial it is to cultivate a general public that can engage with scientific issues; there’s simply no other way that as a society we will be prepared to make informed decisions on a range of issues that will shape the future.”<br />
