Read the following narrative essay: 
Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

Read the following narrative essay: 
I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

Example: There was a time when I was in Grade 5 that my parents cannot give me an allowance going to school. We do not have much money then. It was a big problem for me because I really want to go to school . To help me overcome this problem, I decided to just walk to and from school. Even if my school is a bit far, I just think of it as a good exercise. Another way is I brought my own food to school. I packed the food we have at home and eat it in school so that I do not need money to buy anything. And last, I worked in my aunt's store after class. She would give me Php 50.00 a day after I helped her clean her store. RUBRIC​</a>

Still, it can be reasonably difficult to recognize because it is commonly confused with the cause-and-effect pattern of an organization, as they both have interpersonal structures. However, read the passage and look specifically for a challenge and a solution to the issue.

Garbage that is allowed to accumulate can be a source of disease and even cause flooding. This is also inseparable from the problem of improper waste management. Actually, solving the problem of waste has been a debate for a long time.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Contents (Arrangement of Arguments)</strong></p><p>Some people think that garbage is something that is no longer needed.</p><p>Therefore, waste should be destroyed by burning. But for those who love nature, this method is not a solution but instead brings new disasters. Burning garbage will produce air pollution and can damage the ozone layer.</p><p>People who love the environment, of course, prefer solutions that are more environmentally friendly, such as decomposition and recycling of waste. An example is by making dry leaves, tree trunks, and similar waste into compost, while inorganic waste is recycled.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Basically, waste can be processed and reused. Environmentally friendly waste processing and handling is the most appropriate and effective way to solve existing waste problems.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about discussion text at https://brainly.ph/question/9298290.</p><p></p><p>#SPJ4</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Problem and Solution is a pattern of organization where information in a passage is expressed as a dilemma or concerning issue (a problem) and something that was, can be, or should be done to remedy this issue (solution or attempted solution). The problem and solution text structure may seem like it would be easy to recognize, but it can be moderately difficult to identify because it is frequently confused with the cause and effect pattern of organization, as they both have relational structures; however, if you read the passage and look specifically for both a problem and a solution to the problem, you should find it pretty easy to distinguish from cause and effect, as cause and effect passages do not propose solutions to any negative occurrences within the passage but rather just explain why or how they happen.</p><p></p><p>Example: It seems like there has been a surge in teen pregnancies these days. Teen pregnancies make it very difficult for young mothers to pursue their dreams and meet the demands of an infant. Fortunately, most teen pregnancies can be easily prevented by using birth control; however, even birth control is not 100% effective. The most effective way to prevent teen pregnancies is abstinence, which is 100% effective.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

Performance Task for Week 6 - Problem and Solution Text Type Directions: Write a short problem-solution paragraph (6 to 10 sentences only) using the details you placed under Integrate about the problem you have encountered before and the ways it was or can be solved. You only need to choose one between the two topics you listed. Add relevant details to support your ideas. Use signal words when possible. Example: There was a time when I was in Grade 5 that my parents cannot give me an allowance going to school. We do not have much money then. It was a big problem for me because I really want to go to school . To help me overcome this problem, I decided to just walk to and from school. Even if my school is a bit far, I just think of it as a good exercise. Another way is I brought my own food to school. I packed the food we have at home and eat it in school so that I do not need money to buy anything. And last, I worked in my aunt's store after class. She would give me Php 50.00 a day after I helped her clean her store. RUBRIC​</h2><br />
