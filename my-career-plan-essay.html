                        <p></p><strong>Health </strong><strong>Career plan Essay</strong><p></p><p>Growing up I always knew that I wanted to work with children, from that stemmed my first career choice of becoming a Pediatrician. As I began my career planning in High school the realization of how long it would take to become a doctor discouraged me. I once again changed my career goals to becoming a teacher, and then finally to a nurse who could assist with the delivery of babies. Making the right choice was important to me and that explains the ever changing career decisions. After doing some research I decided that a nurse midwife was along the lines of where I want to be. Completing this the personal career development plan will not only help me see my goals on paper but will give me something to look back on when I have acquired all the goals I set to accomplish.</p><br />
