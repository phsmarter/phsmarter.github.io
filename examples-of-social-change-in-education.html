University of Calgary, CanadaTechnology continues to develop rapidly and is therefore changing our ways offunctioning in society. This brings new dimensions to our responsibilities as educatorsand mentors Doors are constantly opening, bringing more opportunities and at the sametime requiring all of us to rethink the ethical use of technology in schools. For example,Internet cell phones and other communication technologies, while providing us withconveniences, also expose our students to interactions that put their safety and emotionalwell-being at risk. This article examines one negative use of technology-cyberbullying-that is a new form of bullying with distinct differences in form, personality, and response.Recent research studies have shown that a substantial number of students arevictims of cyberbullying, which leads to a wider realization that cyberbullying isbecoming a serious problem (Cross, 2008; Li, 2006, 2006b; Thompson, Smith, &amp;Goldsmith, 2008; Willard, 2004a). This finding calls for a thorough understanding ofcyberbullying that requires us to dissect the relationships among related variables insocial, physical, institutional, and community contexts. This study, therefore, exploresstudent beliefs and their behaviors associated with cyberbullying.Summary: ________________________________________________________________________________________________​</a>

                                            Write all the verbs you will find.It is true that people perceive change in different ways. Some members of the community believe that change is always for the better, while others think otherwise. Those who are in favor of change may argue that it poses a possibility for a particular person to improve him- or herself, both mentally and socially. From the mental perspective, changes relating to traveling and receiving education help one broaden one's mind and learn something new. As for the social perspective - it is empathy for others that he or she may acquire after suffering changes in his or her private life, because it is known that those who experienced various changes in relationships with their family or acquaintances may then better understand other people's feelings. This way, change improves not only person's mental, but also social and private aspect. In contrast, those who avoid changes point out the difficulties to readapt to them that many people experience. For instance, some large companies, Finnair for example, practice giving professional psychological and medicine support to those employees who were sacked due to companies' structural changes. Apparently, such policies infer that a spate of people may suffer from the difficulty to accustom to the changes and find their new way in life. In addition, it can be pointed out that changes regarding private affairs not always make a person better. For many people such changes simply cause a nervous breakdown, and, again, may jeopardize their health, since psychological aspect of a person is tightly connected to his or her general well-being. In conclusion, my view of the problem is that change is an indispensable part of our lives, so people should accept this fact and try to learn how to tackle it rather than avoid it, which is impossible. ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:By the late 18th century, political and economic changes in Europe were finally beginning to affect Spain and, thus, the Philippines. Important as a stimulus to trade was the gradual elimination of the monopoly enjoyed by the galleon to Acapulco. The last galleon arrived in Manila in 1815, and by the mid-1830s Manila was open to foreign merchants almost without restriction. The demand for Philippine sugar and abaca (hemp) grew apace, and the volume of exports to Europe expanded even further after the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The growth of commercial agriculture resulted in the appearance of a new class. Alongside the landholdings of the church and the rice estates of the pre-Spanish nobility there arose haciendas of coffee, hemp, and sugar, often the property of enterprising Chinese-Filipino mestizos. Some of the families that gained prominence in the 19th century have continued to play an important role in Philippine economics and politics.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:pa brainliest</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        ➬ Laughter is the best medicine. Title - LAUGHTERIntroduction - Laughter is a powerful medicine. It attracts people in ways that cause healthy physical and emotional changes in the body. Laughter boosts your immune system, improves your mood, reduces pain, and protects you from the negative effects of stress.(Optional if you want the introduction to be longer) Nothing works faster or more consistently to restore balance to your mind and body than a good laugh. Humor lifts your spirits, gives you hope, connects you to others, and keeps you grounded, focused, and alert. It also aids in the release of anger and the forgiveness of others. Body - We used to laugh hundreds of times a day as children, but as adults, life becomes more serious and laughter becomes less frequent. However, by actively seeking out opportunities for humor and laughter, you can improve your emotional health, strengthen your relationships, find greater happiness, and even add years to your life. Conclusion - Nothing dispels rage and conflict like a good laugh. Looking for the humorous side of things can help you put problems into perspective and move on from confrontations without harboring bitterness or resentment.#Goodluck <p></p><br />

University of Calgary, CanadaTechnology continues to develop rapidly and is therefore changing our ways offunctioning in society. This brings new dimensions to our responsibilities as educatorsand mentors Doors are constantly opening, bringing more opportunities and at the sametime requiring all of us to rethink the ethical use of technology in schools. For example,Internet cell phones and other communication technologies, while providing us withconveniences, also expose our students to interactions that put their safety and emotionalwell-being at risk. This article examines one negative use of technology-cyberbullying-that is a new form of bullying with distinct differences in form, personality, and response.Recent research studies have shown that a substantial number of students arevictims of cyberbullying, which leads to a wider realization that cyberbullying isbecoming a serious problem (Cross, 2008; Li, 2006, 2006b; Thompson, Smith, &amp;Goldsmith, 2008; Willard, 2004a). This finding calls for a thorough understanding ofcyberbullying that requires us to dissect the relationships among related variables insocial, physical, institutional, and community contexts. This study, therefore, exploresstudent beliefs and their behaviors associated with cyberbullying.Summary: ________________________________________________________________________________________________​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This study explores the beliefs and behaviors of high school students about cyberbullying.

                            21. Write all the verbs you will find.It is true that people perceive change in different ways. Some members of the community believe that change is always for the better, while others think otherwise. Those who are in favor of change may argue that it poses a possibility for a particular person to improve him- or herself, both mentally and socially. From the mental perspective, changes relating to traveling and receiving education help one broaden one's mind and learn something new. As for the social perspective - it is empathy for others that he or she may acquire after suffering changes in his or her private life, because it is known that those who experienced various changes in relationships with their family or acquaintances may then better understand other people's feelings. This way, change improves not only person's mental, but also social and private aspect. In contrast, those who avoid changes point out the difficulties to readapt to them that many people experience. For instance, some large companies, Finnair for example, practice giving professional psychological and medicine support to those employees who were sacked due to companies' structural changes. Apparently, such policies infer that a spate of people may suffer from the difficulty to accustom to the changes and find their new way in life. In addition, it can be pointed out that changes regarding private affairs not always make a person better. For many people such changes simply cause a nervous breakdown, and, again, may jeopardize their health, since psychological aspect of a person is tightly connected to his or her general well-being. In conclusion, my view of the problem is that change is an indispensable part of our lives, so people should accept this fact and try to learn how to tackle it rather than avoid it, which is impossible. ​</h2><br />
