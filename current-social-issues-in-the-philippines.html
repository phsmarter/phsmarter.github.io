                        Covid-19. ㅡ Meanwhile, COVID-19 can cause neurological and mental side effects such as delirium, agitation, and stroke.Nutrition. ㅡ The goal of community nutrition actions is to improve the quality of life and contribute to the health promotion of the population in the community where programs and services are provided.The Philippine government has aggressively confronted the HIV/AIDS problem with an action plan that includes an emphasis on local government agency response, involvement and support of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), incorporation of HIV/AIDS education into school curricula, and laws.It all depends on who is developing and educating those children. It could simply be indoctrination. You should also consider who gets to decide what global threats and concerns are. It is preferable to teach people without a specific goal, to teach them to educate themselves, and to let them choose the path they want to take. A large number of educated people pursuing their own goals is preferable to a few leading a large number of people towards agendas.#Carryonlearning <p></p><br />

It includes the analysis of power relations, decision-making processes, and the interaction between different groups and institutions within society.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Economics - This pertains to the study of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It includes the analysis of market trends, economic policies, and their impact on different sectors of society.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Social Sciences - This encompasses various fields of study such as sociology, anthropology, psychology, and history. It involves the examination of human behavior, cultural norms and practices, and social institutions.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>LEVEL 3: Current Issues Found in the Philippines with Explanation</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Political instability and corruption - The Philippines has long been plagued by political instability and corruption, with allegations of vote-buying, graft and corruption, and abuse of power among public officials. This has resulted in a lack of trust in government institutions and political leaders, as well as hindering the country's economic development and social progress.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Income inequality - Despite recent economic growth, income inequality in the Philippines remains a major concern. A significant portion of the population continues to live below the poverty line, while a small percentage of the population controls a disproportionate share of the country's wealth. This creates social tensions and inhibits the country's long-term economic growth potential.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Education - The Philippines faces significant challenges in providing quality education to its citizens, particularly in rural areas. Access to education remains a problem, with many students dropping out due to lack of resources and support. This limits their opportunities for upward mobility and negatively impacts the country's long-term human capital development.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>LEVEL 4: Integration of the 3rd Level</strong></p><p><strong>The three major issues in the Philippines identified in the third level are interconnected and have significant implications for the country's overall development. Political instability and corruption can hinder efforts to address income inequality and improve access to education. Addressing income inequality can help reduce social tensions and promote more inclusive economic growth, which can, in turn, improve access to education and other social services. Improved education can help address income inequality and empower individuals and communities to engage more actively in the political process and demand greater accountability from their leaders.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dictionaries’ Word of the Year for 2016. It relates to ‘circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than emotional appeals’. This perfectly describes the 2016 political campaigns leading to the ‘Brexit’ vote in the UK and the US presidential election.[1]</p><p></p><p></p><p>Casper Grathwohl, President of Oxford Dictionaries, said that the term’s rocketing popularity is ‘fuelled by the rise of social media as a news source and a growing distrust of facts offered up by the establishment.’ He suggests that it will become ‘one of the defining words of our time.’[2]</p><p></p><p>As Grathwohl implies, the term ‘post-truth’ is closely connected with the deluge of ‘fake news’ we have experienced. Jonathan Freedland writes, ‘In this era of post-truth politics, an unhesitating liar can be king. The more brazen his dishonesty, the less he minds being caught with his pants on fire, the more he can prosper. And those pedants still hung up on facts and evidence and all that boring stuff are left for dust, their boots barely laced while the lie has spread halfway around the world’.
