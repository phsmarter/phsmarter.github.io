People believe that during this period, authors emerged because it is the perfect time to publish their literary piecessince Free Press is open for every aspiring authors.3. I think during the emergence period, authors are also able to express their thoughts and ideas that they observeabout the society4. According to Jose M. Hemandez, Philippine Literature during the Emergence period is the perfect time for the writersto discover their forte in writing,5. I believe that period of emergence is also known for author's rapid growth.6.In the article I have read, in 1935-1945 three group of writers emerged, those who are concerned with socialconsciousness, craftsmanship, and those who explore local color.7. In my opinion, these group of writers emerged were able to help Filipino people during this period.8.In 1937 the Philippine Book guild was founded. Its purpose was to produce literature and create a reading in public,9. In 1939, the Philippine Writer's Guild was established. The creed of members was to develop a common culturalconsciousness among Filipinos.10. I think Philippine Book Guild that was established in 1937 became the way to educate many Filipino people in termsof social consciousness, craftsmanship and be aware of local colours.pls answer it​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>During the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines (1521–1898), the different cultures of the archipelago experienced a gradual unification from a variety of native Asian and Islamic customs and traditions, including animist religious practices, to what is known today as Filipino culture, a unique hybrid of Southeast Asian and Western culture, namely Spanish, including the Spanish language and the Catholic faith.</p><p></p><p>Spanish education played a major role in that transformation. The oldest universities, colleges, and vocational schools, dating as far back as the late 16th century were created during the colonial period, as well as the first modern public education system in Asia, established in 1863. By the time Spain was replaced by the United States as the colonial power, Filipinos were among the most educated peoples in all of Asia, boasting one of the highest literacy rates in that continent. Simultaneously, the knowledge of Filipinos about neighboring cultures receded.[1]</p><br />

And if they want to have a face to face class, they should think about the students that will be harmed if there will be something wrong that will happen if they don't take the pandemic seriously. They should know how to approach the other students that don't have an internet connection. The online class should be easy for everyone and not only for those who is rich or with those ability to do an online class.</p><br />

                            30. fact or opinion1 The years saw the emergence of a significant trend in the Philippine Literature in English,2. People believe that during this period, authors emerged because it is the perfect time to publish their literary piecessince Free Press is open for every aspiring authors.3. I think during the emergence period, authors are also able to express their thoughts and ideas that they observeabout the society4. According to Jose M. Hemandez, Philippine Literature during the Emergence period is the perfect time for the writersto discover their forte in writing,5. I believe that period of emergence is also known for author's rapid growth.6.In the article I have read, in 1935-1945 three group of writers emerged, those who are concerned with socialconsciousness, craftsmanship, and those who explore local color.7. In my opinion, these group of writers emerged were able to help Filipino people during this period.8.In 1937 the Philippine Book guild was founded. Its purpose was to produce literature and create a reading in public,9. In 1939, the Philippine Writer's Guild was established. The creed of members was to develop a common culturalconsciousness among Filipinos.10. I think Philippine Book Guild that was established in 1937 became the way to educate many Filipino people in termsof social consciousness, craftsmanship and be aware of local colours.pls answer it​</h2><br />
