                                            How do you know when a design is good or bad? When the design is prettythat means it's good. The human race universally wears articles of clothing-also knownas dress, garments, or attire on the body in order to protect it against the adverseclimate conditions. In its broadest sense, clothing is defined as the coverings of thetorso and limbs, as well as the coverings for the hands, feet and head. Elements andPrinciples of design form the integral part of every designed work. They are discussedin almost every beginning of design course with basic terminology for understandingthe concept of design. Clothing items are not only assessed by the senses, but alsowith emotions and minds. In dressmaking, the tailor or the dressmaker needs toconsider the designing of clothes base on the intended purpose of the customer. It isnoteworthy that designing is the most essential aspect of dressmaking. It thereforemeans that one cannot make an aesthetically pleasing garment without the knowledgeand understanding of the Principles and Elements of design. The principles of designare essential to the development and production of clothing used by individuals andfamilies around the world. When a garment or ensemble uses the elements andprinciples of design to create a visual unity, harmony is achieved. Garments oftenintegrate more than one principle, while drawing from the elements of design to createa cohesive look.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Assessing learning through alternative methods involves a departure from traditional evaluation techniques, such as standardized tests, and embraces a more comprehensive and holistic approach. The basic concepts, theories, and principles in this area emphasize the importance of considering diverse forms of evidence, such as portfolios, projects, presentations, and self-assessments, to gauge students' understanding and progress. These methods prioritize active engagement, critical thinking, and practical application of knowledge. By focusing on the process rather than just the end result, alternative assessment approaches encourage deeper learning, creativity, and problem-solving skills. Additionally, they recognize the individuality of learners, acknowledging that different individuals may excel in different ways and providing multiple pathways for demonstrating mastery. Overall, alternative assessment methods promote a learner-centered approach that fosters a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of students' abilities and achievements.</p><br />

The human race universally wears articles of clothing-also knownas dress, garments, or attire on the body in order to protect it against the adverseclimate conditions. In its broadest sense, clothing is defined as the coverings of thetorso and limbs, as well as the coverings for the hands, feet and head. Elements andPrinciples of design form the integral part of every designed work. They are discussedin almost every beginning of design course with basic terminology for understandingthe concept of design. Clothing items are not only assessed by the senses, but alsowith emotions and minds. In dressmaking, the tailor or the dressmaker needs toconsider the designing of clothes base on the intended purpose of the customer. It isnoteworthy that designing is the most essential aspect of dressmaking. It thereforemeans that one cannot make an aesthetically pleasing garment without the knowledgeand understanding of the Principles and Elements of design. The principles of designare essential to the development and production of clothing used by individuals andfamilies around the world. When a garment or ensemble uses the elements andprinciples of design to create a visual unity, harmony is achieved.
