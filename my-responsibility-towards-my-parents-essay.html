                        <p>Yes, we should be responsible child of God and to your parents. Every person has inculcated values, and I believe every person has goodness to share to his fellowmen. Especially, Filipinos are branded to be hardworking and honest citizens. If you were taught to be responsible when you were a child, thus you will bring that till you get older. </p><br />

Burnout; Nervous Breakdown; Major Depressive Episode. The health professionals all had different labels. The truth was, I was broken. Pride comes before the fall. Here was the inevitable fall. In the matter of a single moment sitting in front of my computer screen, my entire life changed course. Nothing would ever be the same again. I did not realize it at the time and thought that a day off was all that was required. It was not to be. The psychologist had a serious talk to me and I realized the seriousness of the situation I found myself in. I kept wondering how I had missed all the signs? It was plain to see, constant high blood pressure, inability to sleep, growing anxiety, lack of boundaries, stress, the list was almost endless.</p><p></p><p>My journey had begun.</p><p></p><p>For the first time that I can recall I had no destination in mind. I was broken. I did not want to be anywhere or do anything. I had lost the will to live and I didn’t care. Looking back at that time I don’t even recall having thoughts. I either lay in bed or sat on a chair under a blanket. I simply existed, as if in some strange comatose state, whether this was brought on by the breakdown or the handful of tablets that I was required to take every day I am not sure. None the less I was little more than an inanimate object. My fiancé took great care of me, prepared meals, handled whatever business fallouts were taking place, encouraging me to rest and give it time, inviting me to try to make tiny steps towards recovery.</p><p></p><p>This was not how I imagined the journey would be. After all, when they say that it is about the journey, not the destination, one would think that the journey should at least be enjoyable. I could find absolutely no joy in anything.</p><p></p><p>There is also a saying that: “every cloud has a silver lining.” Fortunately, that has also proven to be true for me. My brother in law bought me a return ticket to go visit them in India, and I accepted the gift as I needed to just get away from the world. In March this year, I nervously embarked on a journey to go spend some time with them in India. I did not have any plans to do anything in India, and the main reason for me going was just to get away from everything for a while. Even if the only thing I did whilst I was in India was stay in their house for 6 weeks that would have worked for me.</p><p></p><p>Something inside me shifted though. The moment I said goodbye to my fiancé and stepdaughter and walked through to departures I knew that I was on my own from here. I knew that it was now up to me to create the context for how this journey would unfold.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong># Carry On learning</strong><br />

</p><p>Our parents teach us some of the basic etiquette and ethics of life from a young age, so that we can grow up into honest and responsible adults. They shower their blessings and fund our education so that we can grow up as educated and well-mannered individuals. At times, they live in scarcity and teach us to face difficult situations in life gallantly.
</p><p>
</p><p>Parents work hard so that they can provide us with all the basic resources which are helpful for our overall development. They provide mental, emotional and physical support and help us in taking crucial decisions in our life. They sometimes face tough hardship in their lives and protect us from the vices of society.
</p><p>
</p><p>Parents are the most precious gifts of God for children. Parents consist of a father and mother who give birth to us and nurture us with love and affection right from childhood. Our parents take care of us from the day we come into this world as infants and nurture us until we have grown old enough to take care of ourselves.
</p><p>
</p><p>My parents always encourage us to participate in various indoor and outdoor games.
</p><p>
</p><p>I love both my parents and pray to God for their well-being at all times.</p><p></p><p>[tex]\left[\begin{array}{ccc}CarryonLearning\\-ParkWooMun-\\BrainliestChallenge2021\end{array}\right][/tex]</p><br />

They are both heroes to me not because of what they offered the world, but what they offered me.</p><p></p><p>        To me a hero is someone that you can model yourself after. A person you look up to and strive to be like. To be able to ask yourself what that person would have done in a situation you do not know how to solve. A hero is someone who sets a good example for you and someone with a set of good morals and values. A hero does not always have had to wear a cape and work everyday to save the world.

I admire the fact that my mother worked during the nights while we slept to only get a couple of hours of sleep and be up in the morning when we wake up to take care of us. And my father devoting his energy and time in his company to make sure that me and my brother had everything we wanted and more. I do not understand how my parents did it. Working that much, but still making time for their children. My parents are truly extraordinary people that created a warm and safe environment for me to grow and evolve in. I remember as a young child, if I ever had a bad dream or I was worried that the monsters under my bed would come and take me when I was sleeping. I could always go to My parents room because I knew that no matter what time it was or how early they had to start working the next day they would stay up with me until I fell asleep. I could always count on my heroes to be there whenever I feel like I needed someone. I count on my parents to be there for me even to this day. My parents devoted their whole lives to protecting my brother and I. That's why we love them so much.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
