                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>A good public speaker must have the required skills to create a substantial impact on the audience by communicating his points clearly and by building a connection with the audience. The key to success in public speaking depends on the expressions and body language of the speaker which helps to keep him connected to the audience while speaking. To be a successful public speaker one needs to work on the content as well. The content has to be different from boring lectures overflowing with data and facts but should be made interesting to draw the attention of the audience. This can be done by adding some inspiring and motivational stories, quotes, and real-life examples within the speech.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect is to create an environment for effective interaction between the speaker and the audience. It is a special skill of a good public speaker to keep the audience involved all the time so that their mind can never get diverted. The effectiveness of public speaking depends primarily on the speaking skills that keep the audience engaged and engrossed in the topic being discussed. These speaking skills involve some modulation and variations in voice, expression, and delivery. The purpose is to draw the attention of an audience and get you noticed in front of a large gathering.</p><p></p><br />

                            11. Some students experience anxiety when they are in school, especially during recitation, public speaking and the like, or in an online class to meet the submission date that leads to a stressful day. 
Write an essay on “Stress Management in the Midst of Pandemic”. 
Recite your composition in front of your parents/guardian/siblings, and ask for their opinion on how you can improve it.</h2><br />
                        <p>Stress Management in the Midst of Pandemic</p><p></p><p>Well yeah there are a lot of students who are experiencing anxiety when they are in school. I also encountered that. Why are they experiencing this? Because during recitations, some students are afraid they might mistaken for their answer. Speaking in public, they are also afraid not to be mistaken for their words too. Their courage to speak directly and confidence is not enough that's why they ended up feeling depressed or anxiety. Some people would laugh at them which is the worst. They think that they're not enough. Especially now, online class. We are new to our classmates because we aren't unable to meet them. Oral recitations and they are afraid to get mistaken for their answer which they also feel this when we are still face to face. In my observation, there are really most of the students we are like this whether it is face to face or online class. I am also like this, I just improved when I'm in grade 7. I practice speaking directly and not to be mistaken if I need to recite. Well honestly students should not feel this. If they make a mistake, it's okay. All people make mistakes. The only way to improve theirself is to practice speaking directly and don't think you will make a mistake if you needed to recite or any.</p><p></p><p>About the Online Class platform they used, it's not really helpful. Because most of the students are like this. Not all students can afford the requirements for school and gadget. They are not all fast learners. They are experiecing anxiety when there are submission of requirements and they are unable to submit it. All I can say is: Don't stress yourself now in your online class. If you can't do it, it's your decision if you will still study or continue it next year. If you can still do it, then go keep on fighting. Believe in yourself. Build up your confidence. You can do it. We can do it. It's not bad if we don't study this year. That doesn't mean we are not gonna study anymore. Our health is still the most important right now. Keep on fighting y'all and Stay Safe</p><p></p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Engaging challenges through creative arts, public speaking and writing<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Engaging challenges through creative arts, public speaking and writing</strong> can be done by many people including students. There are many ways in which people can take on challenges and some of them are listed above. </p><p></p><p><strong>Creative arts</strong> allow people to express themselves using colors, canvasses and pencils. A lot of our national issues could be painted down (not in Lagusnilad, of course). Depicting issues in arts had been around for many years now. </p><p></p><p><strong>Public speaking </strong>has been one of the most common ways in which societal challenges had been expressed. Take the speeches given by politicians and opposition members. These speeches are allegedly aimed at pointing out and correcting governmental problems by allowing the public to know them. Remember, however, that words are nothing when not couple by productive action. </p><p></p><p><strong>Writing</strong>, is yet another one. Look at <strong>Jose Rizal.</strong> Through his writings, he was able to make people aware of what was happening during the Spanish era and because he was known for his writing, his death helped with the Revolution. </p><p></p><p>In sum, a person has a repertoire of options where he or she can express his feelings about what is plaguing our society. <strong>Use them correctly</strong>.</p><p></p><p>For more information:</p><p>Steps in Essay Writing: https://brainly.ph/question/580253</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>B</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Editorial is a newspaper article written by or on behalf an editor that gives an opinion on a topical issue <p></p>Answer:B<p></p>Explanation: <p>An editorial, leading article (US) or leader (UK), is an article written by the senior editorial people or publisher of a newspaper, magazine, or any other written document, often unsigned. Australian and major United States newspapers, such as The New York Times[1] and The Boston Globe,[2] often classify editorials under the heading "opinion".
</p><p>
</p><p>Illustrated editorials may appear in the form of editorial cartoons.[3]
</p><p>
</p><p>Typically, a newspaper's editorial board evaluates which issues are important for their readership to know the newspaper's opinion on.[4]
</p><p>
</p><p>Editorials are typically published on a dedicated page, called the editorial page, which often features letters to the editor from members of the public; the page opposite this page is called the op-ed page and frequently contains opinion pieces (hence the name think pieces) by writers not directly affiliated with the publication. However, a newspaper may choose to publish an editorial on the front page. In the English-language press, this occurs rarely and only on topics considered especially important; it is more common, however, in some European countries such as Denmark, Spain, Italy, and France.[5]
</p><p>
</p><p>Many newspapers publish their editorials without the name of the leader writer. Tom Clark, leader-writer for The Guardian, says that it ensures readers discuss the issue at hand rather than the author.[6] On the other hand, an editorial does reflect the position of a newspaper and the head of the newspaper, the editor, is known by name. Whilst the editor will often not write the editorial themselves, they maintain oversight and retain responsibility.[7]
</p><p>
</p><p>In the field of fashion publishing, the term is often used to refer to photo-editorials – features with often full-page photographs on a particular theme, designer, model or other single topic, with or (as in a photo-essay) without accompanying text.[8]</p><br />

                        <p>Public speaking is the act of addressing a group of people with the intention of conveying information, presenting a point of view, or persuading an audience. Public speaking is an integral part of communication and plays a significant role in various walks of life, including academics, politics, sports, and business. A good public speaker is one who can communicate with clarity, conviction, and authority, and is capable of engaging the audience and leaving a lasting impression.</p><p></p><p>Public speaking is often considered to be one of the most challenging activities for many people. Fear of public speaking, also known as glossophobia, is a common phenomenon, with many people experiencing anxiety, nervousness, and stress when they are required to speak in front of a crowd. Research shows that the fear of public speaking is more prevalent than the fear of death, height, or spiders. However, with the right skills, strategies, and practice, anyone can become a proficient public speaker and overcome this fear.</p><p></p><p>A key element of effective public speaking is effective communication. This involves delivering a message that is clear, concise, and impactful. A good public speaker uses a variety of techniques to deliver their message, such as pauses, tone of voice, body language, and eye contact. They also adapt their communication style to suit the needs and preferences of their audience. For instance, when addressing a group of young children, the speaker might use simple language and use visual aids to illustrate their points. However, when addressing a group of business executives, the speaker might use more technical language and incorporate data and statistics to support their message.</p><p></p><p>Another vital aspect of public speaking is the ability to engage, inspire, and persuade an audience. A good public speaker knows how to capture the attention of the audience and create interest in their message. They use techniques such as storytelling, humor, and analogies to make their message more relatable and memorable. They also use persuasive language and rhetoric to convince the audience to take action, change their behavior, or adopt a new idea.</p><p></p><p>To become an effective public speaker, individuals need to invest time and effort in developing their skills. The first step is to understand the basics of public speaking, such as preparing and organizing their message, choosing appropriate language, and practicing their delivery. They can also improve their skills by participating in public speaking competitions, attending workshops and training courses, and seeking feedback from mentors or peers.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, public speaking is an essential communication skill that is needed in various aspects of life.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Lack of education is a drastically big global issue that affects many lives. Lack of education causes multiple issues and it itself is an issue we cannot look over. The simple problem of not having education causes problems such as a deficit in the community, and an intolerant society, and it will create a cycle of poverty. Having a poor educational system can also affect your very own community. First of all, schools are not cheap, as only one school (which fulfills the children 's needs) costs about 26.5 million dollars. </strong></p><p><strong>There are mostly no educated people to run the community because of the lack of schools and people who will rule the community will not be able to run properly because of no education. They will not be educated enough to benefit the community which will result in a corrupt society. The crime rate will be higher because there will be no proper laws. If there will be no educated rulers, there will never be a tolerant society. People will move out of the community but they will face more hardship, as they will not have a place to stay because they had to leave their only homes. It will result in all those people being homeless and then they will also be victims of poverty.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We know that suicide is a terrible killer of the young. Suicidal attempts of adults are less than the young generation. In the United States, suicide is the third major cause of death in 15-to-19-year-olds and the second leading cause of death in college-age students. In 1996, more teenagers and young adults died from suicide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, stroke, and lung disease combined. Suicide kills the young dreadfully and disproportionately. And, across the world, in those between the ages of 15 and 44, suicide is the second leading killer of women and the fourth of men. Nearly one million people die by suicide each year, 30,000 of them in the United States. </p><p>The young update their status and share their feelings on social medias. Moreover, social media is pressuring the stereotypes onto teenagers and causing developed mental health disorders from lack of self-esteem and deteriorating confidence in oneself. A majority of teens are not only abusing the use of social medias but also spending so much time on their devices. Because of social medias, there are so many stereotypes that teens feel that they need to fit in, therefore; after social media comparison and jealousy with others, if teens don’t achieve these invisible standards on social medias, those things will lead them to self-doubt, heavy depressive feelings. All those things easily interfere teens’ goals and bring up invisible pressures, when a teen has a thought of suicide, social media would be one of the reason that make teens committing suicide. To sum up, suicide is an occurrence that is preventable. With the knowledge of suicide’s signs and symptoms, and along the understanding of the teens’ problems, then a person could react immediately in order to prevent teenage suicide. A person who is willing to prevent a suicide from teenagers, a person should let them know that they still have someone that cares about them, make them feel that they are not being rejected. That person ought to be parents, and they have so many ways to prevent the suicide from the teen kids such as don’t let your teens’ depression or anxiety snowball, listen even your teen is not talking, never shrug off threats of suicide as typical melodrama. Parents should know and understand their kids more than they think they do, and do not ever underestimate the suicide, because parent’s unconcern will make a worse consequence and regret for the rest of their life.   </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
