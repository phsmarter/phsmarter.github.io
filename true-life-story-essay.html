                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>"Old Man at the Bridge" is a short story by Ernest Hemingway that takes place during the Spanish Civil War. It follows an old man who is displaced and exhausted from the war and has stopped at a bridge as he makes his way to safety. A soldier passing through stops to talk to him and realizes that the old man's goats have died, leaving him with nothing to do but wait for his own inevitable death.</p><p></p><p>The characters in the story are:</p><p></p><p>The old man</p><p>The soldier</p><p>The setting is a bridge over a river during the Spanish Civil War.</p><p></p><p>The plot centers around the interaction between the old man and the soldier as they discuss the old man's situation and the soldier's duty to continue on with the war.

Select one from the story, and read the observation aloud to the group.</p><p></p><p>One of the characters' observations that rings most true is the soldier's realization that "this was an example of something." He recognizes that the old man's situation is not unique and that there are likely many others like him in the war-torn country.</p><p></p><p>Do you think the old man is a simple or a more complex character? Explain.</p><p></p><p>The old man is a complex character as his resignation is juxtaposed with his determination to make it to safety, showing that he is both resigned to his fate but also fighting to survive.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Explain the difference between a short story to a poem, a drama, and an essay.</p><p></p><p>A short story is a work of fiction that tells a complete story in a condensed format, typically under 10,000 words. A poem is a work of literature that uses language to evoke emotions and imagery in a condensed and rhythmic form. A drama is a work of literature that is meant to be performed, typically on stage, and includes dialogue and stage directions. An essay is a work of non-fiction that presents an argument or explores a topic in an organized and structured format.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Old Man at the Bridge" is a short story written by Ernest Hemingway. It is set during the Spanish Civil War and revolves around an old man who is forced to leave his home due to the war. As he sits by the side of the road, he is discovered by a soldier who stops to talk to him. The old man tells the soldier about his situation and expresses his fear that he will not be able to make it to safety before the enemy arrives.</p><p></p><p>The story's characters include the old man, who is described as "emaciated" and "frightened," and the soldier, who is kind and sympathetic towards the old man. The setting is a dusty road near the Ebro River in Spain during the Spanish Civil War.</p><p></p><p>The plot of the story revolves around the conversation between the old man and the soldier, during which the old man expresses his fear and the soldier attempts to reassure him. The central conflict is the old man's fear of not being able to reach safety before the enemy arrives.</p><p></p><p>The theme of the story is the fragility of life and the human experience of facing death. The story reveals a significant truth about life in that even the most seemingly insignificant individuals have their own stories and fears, and that the inevitability of death makes all lives equally important.</p><p></p><p>One of the characters' observations that rings true is the soldier's comment that "War is not won by evacuation." This statement highlights the fact that war is not just about military strategy and victory, but also about the impact it has on individuals and their lives.</p><p></p><p>The old man is a complex character, as he is not just a representative of the war's civilian casualties, but also a symbol of the human experience of facing mortality and the fear of the unknown.</p><p></p><p>A short story is a work of fiction that is typically shorter than a novel, with a focused plot and limited number of characters. It differs from a poem in that it is prose rather than verse, and from a drama in that it is not intended to be performed. An essay is a nonfiction work that explores a topic or idea, typically in a more structured and analytical format than a short story</p><br />
