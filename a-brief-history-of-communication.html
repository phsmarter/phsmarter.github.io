                                            Activity 5.1. AUTOBIOGRAPHY Autobiography of a StudentMy name is Elizabeth Austen. I was born on May 2, 2002 in Marseille, France. I was raised as a child of two cultures: American and French. Although my parents were born in the USA, they left for Marseille after their wedding because of career goals. My father is a translator, and my mother is an art consultant, so the atmosphere of our house was creative and artistic.It was difficult for me to make friends with French peers. That’s why I have always communicated with adults who were my parents’ friends or colleagues. Since childhood, I have had a thirst for knowledge and new discoveries, and elder friends were happy to share their memories and life experiences with a little, curious girl.I have a talent for learning languages and studying art. That’s not surprising taking into account my environment. When I was a teenager, I dreamed of becoming a writer. I still store my notebooks as a memory about my first drafts.Later on, I understood that my heart belongs to art. I spent much time in my mother’s office listening to her impromptu lectures about famous paintings. Her lessons along with her stories about the USA have inspired me to go to the United States and attend the California College of the Arts to get a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art History.My main belief in life is that everything should be in harmony. People have to keep balance in all spheres of life: society, family, work, friendship, and others. Studying art is my personal way to keep balance. I’m driven by my passion to visit all cities with a rich artistic history: Venice, Rome, London, San-Francisco, Tokyo, and so many others. These journeys will not only improve my professional skills but also will help to learn more about myself and people.I believe that studying at the California College of the Arts will allow me to become a real professional with a mature art taste and extensive knowledge of art history. In the future, I will follow my mother’s footsteps in order to help people discover the beautiful world of art. If my career as an art consultant isn’t successful, I will dedicate my life to teaching future generations of students and cultivating their love of fine arts.1. Who are the characters?2.

Although Philippine literature at the turn of the 21st century is considered to have a brief history; however, most of its writers have already left significant marks in the minds and hearts of its readers through their writings. According to Uychoco (2016), Jose Rizal's undying Noli Me Tangere, casts a long shadow on Philippine literature, today's literary scene is quite different from what it was in the past. English as Second Language teachers still introduce this masterpiece to today's learners as it has emerged not only flexible but innovative literature that has been appreciated and used in various literary learning and even educational debates about language. Literary appreciation is a way of expressing and communicating one's thoughts and ideas about the texts read. It is not just about reading and appreciating them, it is also about understanding their contexts. Through this, both teachers and learners will have a better and wider mental grasp of what they read. It is how we interpret what we read that help us gain a general knowledge of our history and strengthen even our very own personal reflection on our present situation. Philippine literature helps our Filipino learners catch a glimpse of our culture and heritage: that is to say, whatever literary genre we read moves us, triggers our wild imagination, provokes our sense of curiosity, and stirs our thoughts and feelings, upon our own common experience of our present situations.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Communication is the process of creating, interpreting, and negotiating meaning. Communication can be verbal, nonverbal, or textual. It can be aural, visual, or even physical. Although communication occurs in a variety of different ways, it is always a learned behaviour. While most human beings are born with the physical abilities to speak, to hear, to see, and so on, people must learn to communicate through codes, symbols, and systems of language. In this way, communication is a collective practice in which people use symbols to generate and interpret meaning.

Models of Communication

In order to explain the social process of communication, scholars have developed several models. The three most well known models for communication are Linear, Interactional, and Transactional. As West &amp; Turner (2007) explain, each model sheds light on the development of communication, but emphasizes different parts of the communication process. The models provide pictures, or visual representations, of complex interactions. They are useful because they simplify the basic structure of communication and can help us to understand that structure not just verbally, but also visually. Most importantly, they identify the various elements of communication and serve as a kind of map to show how different parts of the communication process are interrelated.

Linear Models

Originally developed by Shannon &amp; Weaver in 1948, this model describes communication as a linear process. (See Figure 1.1.) This model describes how a sender, or speaker, transmits a message to a receiver, or listener. More specifically, the sender is the source of the message. A message may consist of the sounds, words, or behaviours in a communication interaction. The message itself is transmitted through a channel, the pathway or route for communication, to a receiver, who is the target or recipient of the message. There may be obstacles in the communication process, or noise. Noise refers to any interference in the channel or distortion of the message. This is a fairly simple model in which a message is simply passed from sender to receiver.

                            7. Activity 5.1. AUTOBIOGRAPHY Autobiography of a StudentMy name is Elizabeth Austen. I was born on May 2, 2002 in Marseille, France. I was raised as a child of two cultures: American and French. Although my parents were born in the USA, they left for Marseille after their wedding because of career goals. My father is a translator, and my mother is an art consultant, so the atmosphere of our house was creative and artistic.It was difficult for me to make friends with French peers. That’s why I have always communicated with adults who were my parents’ friends or colleagues. Since childhood, I have had a thirst for knowledge and new discoveries, and elder friends were happy to share their memories and life experiences with a little, curious girl.I have a talent for learning languages and studying art. That’s not surprising taking into account my environment. When I was a teenager, I dreamed of becoming a writer. I still store my notebooks as a memory about my first drafts.Later on, I understood that my heart belongs to art. I spent much time in my mother’s office listening to her impromptu lectures about famous paintings. Her lessons along with her stories about the USA have inspired me to go to the United States and attend the California College of the Arts to get a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art History.My main belief in life is that everything should be in harmony. People have to keep balance in all spheres of life: society, family, work, friendship, and others. Studying art is my personal way to keep balance. I’m driven by my passion to visit all cities with a rich artistic history: Venice, Rome, London, San-Francisco, Tokyo, and so many others. These journeys will not only improve my professional skills but also will help to learn more about myself and people.I believe that studying at the California College of the Arts will allow me to become a real professional with a mature art taste and extensive knowledge of art history. In the future, I will follow my mother’s footsteps in order to help people discover the beautiful world of art. If my career as an art consultant isn’t successful, I will dedicate my life to teaching future generations of students and cultivating their love of fine arts.1. Who are the characters?2.

The symptoms of Covid-19 vary from person to person. The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, some people may experience more severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, and bluish lips or face. It is important to monitor your symptoms and seek medical attention if you experience any of these severe symptoms.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Topic: Difference among Enhanced Community Quarantine, Modified Community Quarantine, General Community Quarantine.</p><p></p><p>The Philippine government has implemented different levels of community quarantine to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) is the strictest level of quarantine, where only essential businesses are allowed to operate and people are only allowed to leave their homes for essential purposes. The Modified Community Quarantine (MCQ) is less strict than the ECQ, but still restricts the movement of people and businesses. The General Community Quarantine (GCQ) is the least strict level of quarantine, where most businesses are allowed to operate and people are allowed to leave their homes for non-essential purposes.

It is caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The virus quickly spread to other countries, leading the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic in March 2020. Since then, the virus has affected millions of people worldwide and has caused significant disruptions to daily life. Scientists and medical professionals continue to work towards developing a vaccine and effective treatments for Covid-19. It is important to stay informed and follow guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus. </p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Topic: How to properly use and dispose a face mask.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a face mask is an effective way to prevent the spread of Covid-19. It is important to properly use and dispose of a face mask to ensure its effectiveness. Before putting on a face mask, make sure to wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer. Place the mask over your nose and mouth, making sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask. Avoid touching the mask while wearing it and replace it if it becomes damp or soiled. To dispose of a face mask, remove it by the ear loops and discard it in a trash bin. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water or use hand sanitizer after disposing of the mask.</p><br />

For centuries, Philippines has become popular for its prolific writers when it comes to literary undertakings. Although Philippine literature at the turn of the 21st century is considered to have a brief history; however, most of its writers have already left significant marks in the minds and hearts of its readers through their writings. According to Uychoco (2016), Jose Rizal's undying Noli Me Tangere, casts a long shadow on Philippine literature, today's literary scene is quite different from what it was in the past. English as Second Language teachers still introduce this masterpiece to today's learners as it has emerged not only flexible but innovative literature that has been appreciated and used in various literary learning and even educational debates about language. Literary appreciation is a way of expressing and communicating one's thoughts and ideas about the texts read. It is not just about reading and appreciating them, it is also about understanding their contexts. Through this, both teachers and learners will have a better and wider mental grasp of what they read. It is how we interpret what we read that help us gain a general knowledge of our history and strengthen even our very own personal reflection on our present situation. Philippine literature helps our Filipino learners catch a glimpse of our culture and heritage: that is to say, whatever literary genre we read moves us, triggers our wild imagination, provokes our sense of curiosity, and stirs our thoughts and feelings, upon our own common experience of our present situations.
