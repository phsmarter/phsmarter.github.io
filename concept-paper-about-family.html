As the leader of the class, you are expected to make sure that the chairs are properly arranged and the number in each row is correct. Your class decide to arrange the chair differently. In the first row, there will be 30 seats. The 15th chair from the left is 1 meter away from the 16th chair to provide easy entrance and exit for the audience. Then two chair added in the second row, one to the leftmost part and the other to the rightmost part. The third row will have 34 chairs; the fourth row, 36 chairs; the fifth row, 38 chairs; and so on. This process is continued until the 30th row. In order to succeed and perform your task, do the following: 1. How many chairs are there in the 10 rows? 2. Analyze the number of chairs between two consecutive rows, make a rule or equation on how you can find the number of chairs in a certain row. 3. Consider the ordered pair of numbers (row number, number of chairs). Let x be the row number and y be the number of chairs. a. Form four ordered pairs based on table in #1. b. On a graphing paper, make a cartesian coordinate plane, plot and connect these points. Label the x- axis as the row number and the y- axis as the number of chairs. 4. Based on the graph, a. Do the points lie on the same line? b. What is the slope of the line? c. What is the y-intercept of the line? d. What is the equation of the line in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b)? 5.

                                            Every Filipina is a source of endless possibilities. Her person embraces the roles of responsibledaughter, steadfast sister, generous aunt, indifferent employee, consistent ex-lover, bill settler, a personwho knows exactly how to uncomplicated matters for each member of the family, yet, she knows nothow to identify what she has long wanted for herself. She may have won the battle against men forequal opportunity; but she has lost and forgotten the spirit that drove her to win the battle. She canhardly recognize herself, perhaps, who she had been, as an individual who once had an underratedself-image. But declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair in the formerly man's worldthen needs disambiguation. Did she fight for self-actualization because she wanted to pursue a careerin the field of her choice or, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple itsfunction? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter. Perhaps she thinks of herselfas messiah, and uses the same strength and freedom that she has acquired from her battle for equalityto save and rescue her family. She has become indifferent to her needs again caged, caged in herpretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwavering confidence; she uses her resources andtakes responsibility of her family; she exercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; sheworks hard for others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginablypowerful person, who does everything she can possibly think of and defies anyone who challenges herotherwise. She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself. She has enoughcomparison for her family, yet, she has not left any for herself.Activity 1. Answer the questions that follow:1.

                                            Every Filipina is a source of endless possibilities. Her person embraces
the roles of responsible daughter, steadfast sister, generous aunt, indifferent
employee, consistent ex-lover, bill settler, a person who knows exactly how-to
uncomplicated matters for each member of the family; yet, she knows not how
to identify what she has long wanted for herself. She may have won the battle
against men for equal opportunity; but she has lost and forgotten the spirit that
drove her to win the battle. She can hardly recognize herself, perhaps, who
she had been, as an individual who once had an underrated self-image. But
declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair inthe formerly man’s world then needs disambiguation. Did she fight for selfactualization because she wanted to pursue a career in the field of her choiceor, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple its
function? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter.Perhaps she thinks of herself as messiah, and uses the same strength andfreedom that she has acquired from her battle for equality to save and rescueher family. She has become indifferent to her needs again- caged, caged inher pretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwaveringconfidence; she uses her resources and takes responsibility of her family; sheexercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; she works hardfor others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginably powerful person, who does everything she can possibly think ofand defies anyone who challenges her otherwise.She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself.She has enough compassion for her family; yet, she has not left any forherself.

                                            Every Filipina is a source of endless possibilities. Her person embraces the roles of responsible daughter, steadfast sister, generous aunt, indifferent employee, consistent ex-lover, bill settler, a person who knows exactly how to uncomplicated matters for each member of the family; yet, she knows not how to identify what she has long wanted for herself. She may have won the battle against men for equal opportunity; but, she has lost and forgotten the spirit that drove her to win the battle. She can hardly recognize herself, perhaps, who she had been, as an individual who once had an underrated self-image. But declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair in the formerly man’s world then needs disambiguation. Did she fight for self-actualization because she wanted to pursue a career in the field of her choice or, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple its function? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter. Perhaps she thinks of herself as messiah, and uses the same strength and freedom that she has acquired from her battle for equality to save and rescue her family. She has become indifferent to her needs againcaged, caged in her pretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwavering confidence; she uses her resources and takes responsibility of her family; she exercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; she works hard for others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginably powerful person, who does everything she can possibly think of and defies anyone who challenges her otherwise. She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself. She has enough comparison for her family; yet, she has not left any for herself.Questions:1.

Her person embraces the roles of responsibledaughter, steadfast sister, generous aunt, indifferent employee, consistent ex-lover, bill settler, a personwho knows exactly how to uncomplicated matters for each member of the family, yet, she knows nothow to identify what she has long wanted for herself. She may have won the battle against men forequal opportunity; but she has lost and forgotten the spirit that drove her to win the battle. She canhardly recognize herself, perhaps, who she had been, as an individual who once had an underratedself-image. But declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair in the formerly man's worldthen needs disambiguation. Did she fight for self-actualization because she wanted to pursue a careerin the field of her choice or, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple itsfunction? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter. Perhaps she thinks of herselfas messiah, and uses the same strength and freedom that she has acquired from her battle for equalityto save and rescue her family. She has become indifferent to her needs again caged, caged in herpretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwavering confidence; she uses her resources andtakes responsibility of her family; she exercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; sheworks hard for others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginablypowerful person, who does everything she can possibly think of and defies anyone who challenges herotherwise. She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself. She has enoughcomparison for her family, yet, she has not left any for herself.Activity 1. Answer the questions that follow:1.

the roles of responsible daughter, steadfast sister, generous aunt, indifferent
employee, consistent ex-lover, bill settler, a person who knows exactly how-to
uncomplicated matters for each member of the family; yet, she knows not how
to identify what she has long wanted for herself. She may have won the battle
against men for equal opportunity; but she has lost and forgotten the spirit that
drove her to win the battle. She can hardly recognize herself, perhaps, who
she had been, as an individual who once had an underrated self-image. But
declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair inthe formerly man’s world then needs disambiguation. Did she fight for selfactualization because she wanted to pursue a career in the field of her choiceor, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple its
function? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter.Perhaps she thinks of herself as messiah, and uses the same strength andfreedom that she has acquired from her battle for equality to save and rescueher family. She has become indifferent to her needs again- caged, caged inher pretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwaveringconfidence; she uses her resources and takes responsibility of her family; sheexercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; she works hardfor others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginably powerful person, who does everything she can possibly think ofand defies anyone who challenges her otherwise.She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself.She has enough compassion for her family; yet, she has not left any forherself.
