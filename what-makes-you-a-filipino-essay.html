                                            I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4.

                            6. I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well.

 Online bullying remains prevalent in the Philippines, other countries
 Cyberviolence affects almost half of Filipino children aged 13-1</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>8 years old, according to a study by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). The study found that 47% of Filipino children have experienced online bullying or cyberviolence. This phenomenon is not unique to the Philippines, as it is prevalent in other countries as well.</p><p></p><p>Cyberbullying is a form of bullying that takes place online, through social media, messaging apps, or other digital platforms. It can take many forms, such as spreading rumors, sharing embarrassing photos or videos, or sending threatening messages. The anonymity and distance provided by the internet make it easier for bullies to harass their victims, and for the victims to feel helpless and isolated.</p><p></p><p>The prevalence of cyberbullying highlights the need for stronger measures to prevent and address this issue. Schools, parents, and government agencies must work together to educate children about responsible online behavior, and to provide support and resources to victims of cyberbullying.</p><p></p><p>One way to address this issue is through the use of technology itself. Social media platforms and messaging apps can implement features that allow users to report and block abusive behavior, and to provide resources and support to victims. Artificial intelligence can also be used to detect and prevent cyberbullying, by analyzing patterns of behavior and detecting harmful content.</p><p></p><p>Another approach is to promote empathy and kindness in children, by teaching them to respect others and to stand up against bullying. This can be achieved through programs that promote social and emotional learning, and that encourage children to develop positive relationships and to engage in community service.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, cyberbullying is a serious issue that affects many children in the Philippines and around the world. It is important for all stakeholders to work together to prevent and address this issue, through education, technology, and promoting empathy and kindness.</p><p></p><p>Claim used: Cyberbullying is a serious issue that requires a multi-faceted approach to prevent and address it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Literary adaptation is the adapting of a literary source (e.g. a novel, short story, poem) to another genre or medium, such as a film, stage play, or video game.</p><p>2.Books are much better. When reading a book you can let your imagination decide how the characters feel and look, whereas in films, some director decides how they look and talk." "Books are much better! They can take you much further than movies, even with all the new special effects."</p><p>3.</p><p>4.Filipino cartoon and animation, also known as Pinoy cartoon and animation, is a body of original cultural and artistic works and styles applied to conventional Filipino storytelling, combined with talent and the appropriate application of classic animation principles, methods, and techniques, which recognizes their relationship with Filipino culture, comics, and films.

</p><p>
</p><p>      "I'm dreaming of a green Christmas," wrote a Filipina working at the United Nations in New York. In the midst of the snow and tinsel, the bright shop windows and the glittering trees of an American Christmas, she remembered the soft lantern light from a star-shaped parol, the nip in the air as one walked to the dawn misa de gallo, and especially the food: "It was not really the choir voices nor the whispered prayers of our elders that kept us awake. It was something else... the promise of the piping hot puto bumbong being prepared by the vendors along the way home that kept our spirits up, our appetites whetted, and hence, our senses disquieted. The sweet lavender rice sprouting out of little bamboo tubes, topped by a generous sprinkling of grated coconut meal and brown sugar, was part of our Christmas delight."
</p><p>
</p><p>      She was, of course, remembering the makeshift stalls that sprout like mushrooms the week the dawn masses begin. Along the streets leading to the churches, and especially in the patios-at Las Piňas, under an ancient tree lit by a galaxy of lanterns-are built lean-tos made from bamboo poles  </p><p>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.</p><p></p><p>The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.</p><p> </p><p>The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.</p><p></p><p> </p><br />
