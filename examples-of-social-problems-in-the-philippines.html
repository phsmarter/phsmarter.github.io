What are the manifestations of this statement in our society?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Social Science as a discipline provides various frameworks, concepts, and tools that can be utilized to address present-day problems in the community. By understanding the human behavior and social processes that shape our society, we can analyze the causes and consequences of current issues and develop solutions that are effective and sustainable. In summary, Social Science provides a valuable lens through which we can understand and address present-day problems in our community. By utilizing its frameworks, concepts, and tools, we can develop strategies that are evidence-based, effective, and sustainable.E.B. Tylor's definition of culture as a "complex whole" means that culture is composed of various interconnected components such as beliefs, values, practices, and material artifacts that form a coherent system. Applying this definition to Philippine society, we can understand the diverse and complex nature of Philippine culture. In the Philippines, culture is shaped by a variety of factors such as history, religion, language, and geography. The country's rich history of colonization, trade, and migration has resulted in a diverse mix of cultures and influences, which have been integrated into the fabric of Filipino society. In summary, Tylor's definition of culture as a "complex whole" is useful in understanding Philippine society as a diverse and interconnected system shaped by a variety of historical, cultural, and social factors.Firstly, understanding political science concepts such as governance, democracy, and civil society can equip individuals with the knowledge to participate in civic activities, such as voting, advocacy, and community organizing. By participating in these activities, individuals can practice their civic skills, such as critical thinking, public speaking, and leadership, while promoting humane ideals such as social justice, equality, and human rights. Secondly, studying political science can also help individuals develop a critical understanding of the political system and its impact on society. This can lead to a greater awareness of social and political issues, and a deeper empathy for the experiences of marginalized groups. With this knowledge, individuals can use their voice to advocate for the rights and well-being of these groups, and work towards creating a more just and equitable society. Finally, political science can also provide individuals with a global perspective on political issues and events. By studying politics in other countries, individuals can gain an appreciation for diverse cultures and ways of life, and develop a sense of global citizenship. This can lead to a greater understanding of the interconnectedness of political issues, and a deeper commitment to promoting peace and cooperation among nations.In recent years, there has been a rise in the popularity of Filipino music and dance, with Filipino artists gaining international recognition. Additionally, traditional Filipino dance, such as the Tinikling and the Singkil, has gained recognition and popularity in international dance competitions. Filipino cuisine has also gained popularity worldwide, with Filipino dishes like adobo, sinigang, and halo-halo becoming more widely known and appreciated. In terms of fashion and beauty, there has been a growing interest in Filipino textiles and fashion, with designers incorporating traditional Filipino fabrics and styles into their designs.Politics is often said to be about power sharing and power struggle because it involves the distribution and exercise of power among individuals and groups within a society. Those who hold power may seek to maintain it, while those who do not may seek to gain it. This struggle for power can manifest in various ways in our society. Another manifestation of power struggle in politics is the tension between different branches of government. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government may have different interests and priorities, which can result in conflicts and power struggles as each branch tries to assert its influence and control over government functions. Furthermore, power struggles can also occur within and between social groups in society. For example, there may be conflicts between labor unions and business owners over worker rights and wages. There may also be struggles between different ethnic or religious groups over political representation or access to resources.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>douitashimashite</p><br />
