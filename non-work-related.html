                        <p></p><p>The advancements in cellular phone technology can be traced in different and distinct generations, from the early Mobile Telephone Service (MTS), and the successive Improved Mobile Telephone Service. Next, is the first generation (1G) analog cell phone network, then, the second-generation (2G) digital phone network, followed by, third-generation (3G) broadband data services. Further, came the fourth generation (4G), which has the current prevailing state of art in the cell phone industry with IP networks.</p><p></p><p>Cell phones form an integral part of people’s daily life. They aid people to stay in a constant contact with their family, friends and in keeping abreast in their daily business transactions throughout the world. Nevertheless, in the recent past, people were confined to their home network and cell phones connected within a single based service coverage area. Thus, there was no continuity for the cell phones only worked through several cell areas. Hence, it was very complex and expensive to use cell phones outside one’s designed home network.</p><p></p><p>Currently, various technologies are available to everyone, which include cellular phones, gaming systems, Mp3 players, laptops among others. These technological advancements make it easier for the children to access and fit whatever device they wish to have in their pockets or backpacks. Children’s are widely connected to the outside world since they view mobile phones as a lifeline, with the average teenager sending at least 2,000 messages a month through their cell phone. Nevertheless, cell phones have negative impacts on the same people who cannot live without them. The use of cell phone endangers lives when used while driving, defacing face-to-face communication is defaced, and a distraction of students while studying among others.</p><p></p><p>Conclusively, it is difficult to imagine how life would be like without the use of cell phone. Cell phones are practically used in almost all aspects of life for communication. Thus, the property of the mobile phones has rapidly enhanced communication by making it easy to transfer and receive information from just about anywhere without the limitation of the network, a disadvantage that used to hinder effective and direct communication in the past generations.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revolutionized global healthcare in an unprecedented way and with unimaginable repercussions. Resource reallocation, socioeconomic confinement and reorganization of production activities are current challenges being faced both at the national and international levels, in a frame of uncertainty and fear. Hospitals have been restructured to provide the best care to COVID-19 patients while adopting preventive strategies not to spread the infection among healthcare providers and patients affected by other diseases. As a consequence, the concept of urgency and indications for elective treatments have been profoundly reshaped. In addition, several providers have been recruited in COVID-19 departments despite their original occupation, resulting in a profound rearrangement of both inpatient and outpatient care. Orthopaedic daily practice has been significantly affected by the pandemic. Surgical indications have been reformulated, with elective cases being promptly postponed and urgent interventions requiring exceptional attention, especially in suspected or COVID-19+ patients. This has made a strong impact on inpatient management, with the need of a dedicated staff, patient isolation and restrictive visiting hour policies. On the other hand, outpatient visits have been limited to reduce contacts between patients and the hospital personnel, with considerable consequences on post-operative quality of care and the human side of medical practice.</p><p></p><p>In this review, we aim to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the orthopaedic practice. Particular attention will be dedicated to opportune surgical indication, perioperative care and safe management of both inpatients and outpatients, also considering repercussions of the pandemic on resident education and ethical implications.</p><br />
