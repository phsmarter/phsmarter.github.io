And of course you really need to have Collaboration up and running. Youcannot do all things alone and by yourself, you really need to have someone to haveby your side. And as life goes on, you think that you knew everything but no. Youmust   have   an   open   mind   for   everything   that’s   all   about   the   world   and   yoursurroundings. You need to have some Cross-Cultural Understanding in your mindand in your heart. And going back in the Collaboration lifelong skill, you need to notbe alone by having Communication in everything and, as long as possible, everyoneso you won’t be as the world progresses, you need to have your body adapt to the digital world andhave the Computing lifelong skill, because it’s inevitable that the digital age shall runin the world for a long time.

When compared the teachers with the computers, the technology will not teach the ethics, way of life, or moral values but the teacher along with the subject can teach how to live with the moral values, ethics &amp; integrity, and the responsibilities. The technology can’t replace the teachers because the teacher itself says how to use the technology in a right way. The best example of this is, the calculator cannot replace the mathematics teacher. A teacher can grasp the interest of the students but the computer cannot find out the interesting subjects of the students. Some of the students can’t afford the fees for their studies; in this case, the technology will help in preparing their studies.​</a>

                                            The world is constantly changing. This proves that the only thing constant in this world is change. And to keep abreast with the changes around us, one must also upgrade one's self every now and then. One of the best ways to do this is to learn new skills, whether it is for personal development or for an opportunity of finding a better career. To be able to do this, one can attend training programs which provide fresh knowledge; learn new skills on his present job with the help of his co-workers; be open to supervisors/ colleagues for coaching and mentoring; read new developments, trends, and innovations that are related to one's job; and join forums on-line which will provide a wider source of newer information relating to one's job or profession. Upgrading one's knowledge and skills is beneficial as it helps in increasing a person's self-confidence, improves competitiveness leading to a greater chance of being hired or promoted, develops creativeness which contributes to productiveness, and opens doors for better and wider career opportunities. Most jobs today are adapting to the changes that is brought by technological trends and advancement. Thus, one must also be able to adapt and be up-to-date with the developments and trends that has something to do with their job. II. EXERCISES Read the following situations below and briefly answer the questions that follow. Choose among the following ways: attend training programs, learn new skills, coaching and mentoring of supervisor/ colleagues, read new developments, trends, and innovations, join forums on-line. 1.

                                            A. William Henry Gates III (Bill) was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. Bill was the second of three children in an upper-middle class family. He enjoyed playing games with the family and was very competitive. He also loved to read. Bill became bored in public school, so his family sent him to Lakeside School, a private school, where he excelled in math and science and did well in drama and English. Gates became interested in computer programming when he was 13, during the era of giant mainframe computers. His school held a fund-raiser to purchase a teletype terminal so students could use computer time that was donated by General Electric. Using this time, Gates wrote a tic-tac-toe program using BASIC, one of the first computer languages. Later he created a computer version of Risk, a board game he liked in which the goal is world domination. At Lakeside, Bill met Paul Allen, who shared his interest in computers. Gates and Allen and two other students hacked into a computer belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) to get free computer time but were caught. After a period of probation, they were allowed back in the computer lab when they offered to fix glitches in CCC’s software. At age 17, Gates and Allen were paid $20,000 for a program called Traf-O-Data that was used to count traffic. In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the SAT and was accepted by Harvard University. Steve Ballmer, who became CEO of Microsoft after Bill retired, was also a Harvard student. Meanwhile, Paul Allen dropped out of Washington College to work on computers at Honeywell Corporation and convinced Gates to drop out of Harvard and join him in starting a new software company in Albuquerque, New Mexico. They called it Micro-Soft. This was soon changed to Microsoft, and they moved their company to Bellevue, Washington. In 1980, IBM, one of the largest technology companies of the era, asked Microsoft to write software to run their new personal computer, the IBM PC. Microsoft kept the licensing rights for the operating system (MS-DOS) so that they earned money for every computer sold first by IBM, and later by all the other companies that made PC computers. Microsoft grew quickly from 25 employees in 1978 to over 90,000 today. Over the years, Microsoft developed many new technologies and some of the world’s most popular software and products such as Word and PowerPoint. Although some have criticized Gates for using questionable business practices, he built Microsoft into one of the largest companies in the world. He has been described as brilliant but childlike, driven, competitive, intense, fun, but lacking in empathy. Bill Gates is one of the richest men in the world. In 2012, his $61 billion in assets made him the world's second richest man according to Forbes Magazine. In 2006, Gates announced that he would cut back his involvement at Microsoft to spend more time on philanthropy and his foundation. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports many causes including the quest to eradicate polio, fighting AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis; providing vaccinations for children; and even reinventing the toilet, among many other things. 1.

(2pts each) Since the COVID -19 pandemic has disrupted the normal lifestyle of people across the globe, the virtual world has come to the rescue. Amongst many institutions schools have also shifted their base to virtual platforms to conduct classes online. Students and teachers also have their own struggles while accessing these online platforms. Due to financial constraints, students are not able to access the internet, and are devoid of electronic gadgets and laptop, phone or computer or even radio and TV. Those students who have facilities to attend to online classes face barriers in terms of unavailability of physical space, which is equally applicable to teachers who are supposed to conduct online classes from their home.

                                            TLE-ICT Computers: A Big Past, A Small Future Over 65 years ago the world's first computer was born. Scientist called it "The Baby" but it was huge. It filled an entire room. Three people made the computer and programmed Math problems for it. On June 19, 1948, the computer solved its first Math problem - in 52 minutes! At that time this was amazing. Computer are now much smaller. With touch screen technology, many computers don't need extra things, like a keyboard or a mouse. In the future, computers probably won't need this thing at all. Some computers, like smartphone can fit in one hand. Computers also more powerful today. There is more computing power in a smartphone than there was in all of the computers on Apollo 11, the first spacecraft to take people to the moon. How else will computers change in the future? A computer's "brain" is a chip inside the computer, and in the future, people will definitely be able to save much more information on a computer chip. So, computers will be smaller and even more powerful. Perhaps they even think like humans! Maybe we won't need to tell computers what to do because they'll decide for themselves..

                                            College students are often considered a bellwether of Internet use, but the Internet is not the only technology they have incorporated into everyday life. Thanks to a plethora of technologies (video game consoles, computers, handheld devices, Internet) a range of entertainment options is at their disposal, a range that is much wider than was available to their predecessors. Furthermore, today’s college students are using technologies like cell phones, mp3 players and other devices to entertain themselves wherever they may be. The goal of this study was to learn about college students’ use of video, computer and online games, and to determine the impact of that use on their everyday life. To meet those goals the researchers used three approaches. First, surveys were randomly distributed to college students at a wide range of two-year and four-year public and private colleges and universities in the continental United States. Students from 27 colleges and universities participated and the surveys were collected between March 2002 and June 2002, and September 2002 and October 2002. This sample was intended to produce results that would correspond to the demographics for all U.S. college students as reported in The Chronicle of Higher Education’s annual almanac issue.10 The sample was tested against known population parameters (gender, race, age) and found to be reflective of the national population of college students. In all, 1,162 surveys were returned. For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling and other random effects is plus or minus 3 percentage points. This study focused on traditional college students, ones who are seeking a college degree and who devote much or all of their time to their studies. Second, a team of graduate student researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago was recruited to observe the behaviors of college students at 10 Chicago area institutions of higher education. The researchers were trained in ethnographic methods of observation and data collecting, and rotated the times of the day and days of the week they spent in various public settings where college students could be found using computers and the Internet. Third, additional material was based on a previous study of college students’ Internet use conducted by this research team for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project11 and on the findings of surveys of Americans about their use of the Internet conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates in 2001 and 2002 for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project.1.

                                            Read the news article below and answer the questions that follow.Around a third of the ice shelves holding back huge glaciers in Antarctica are at risk of collapse if the world fails to take sufficient action on climate change, new projections have found.The ice shelves circling the continent are vulnerable to meltwater on their surface causing the ice to crack and disintegrate, a process known as hydrofracturing.Computer modelling by Ella Gilbert at the University of Reading, UK, and Christoph Kittel at the University of Liege, Belgium, showed that if the world warms by 4°C since pre-industrial levels, then 34 per cent of the continent’s ice shelves will have meltwater on their surface, a sign they are at risk of collapse.However, the figure falls to 18 per cent if temperature rises are checked at 2°C. The world is currently on track for a 2.9°C rise but, if implemented, climate plans and net zero goals would cut that to 2.1°C.“Warming to 2°C means half the ice shelf area is at risk of collapsing. That is the message: the less the warming the better,” says Gilbert.She and Kittel used a much higher resolution climate model than previous research, with grid squares 35 kilometres across rather than hundreds of kilometres across. It also more accurately represents cloud physics, which is vital as estimates of the area at risk of collapse hinge on how much ice loss is replaced by snowfall. The big difference between the 2°C and 4°C rise scenarios stems from melting outweighing increased snowfall in a 4°C warmer world.The Larsen C ice shelf on the east of the Antarctic Peninsula, where a huge iceberg broke off in 2017, was found to be one of the areas most at risk.“This study shows melting at the ice shelves’ surface will spreads southwards to parts of the continent where huge reservoirs of inland ice may lose their protective barrier. If that happens, we can expect rapid increases in sea level rise along every coastline of our planet,” says Andrew Shepherd at the University of Leeds, UK, who wasn’t involved with the paper.The research doesn’t put a figure on how much sea level rise could occur if ice shelves collapsed and released the glaciers behind them. However, Gilbert says: “My gut feeling is for 4°C it could potentially contribute tens of centimetres if they did collapse.” Avoiding 10 centimetres of sea level rise should expose 10 million fewer people globally to flooding risks.Helene Seroussi at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, who wasn’t part of the research team, says the study’s big advance is using a higher resolution model. While the research identifies ice shelves that could be hydrofractured, Seroussi says further analysis of how individual ice shelves move – the “dynamical stress regime” – is needed to work out which ones will actually collapse.1. What impact of climate change is presented in the given article?2. According to the computer model made by Gilbert and Kittel, what will happen if the world warms by 4'C?3. How will you elaborate the statement made by Gilbert, "the less the warming, the better"?4. What are the possible impacts to the environment and mankind if the ice shelves collapse?5. In your opinion, how many the people help to lesson the effect of climate change?​</a>

                                            Around a third of the ice shelves holding back huge glaciers in Antarctica are at risk of collapse if the world fails to take sufficient action on climate change, new projections have found.The ice shelves circling the continent are vulnerable to meltwater on their surface causing the ice to crack and disintegrate, a process known as hydrofracturing.Computer modelling by Ella Gilbert at the University of Reading, UK, and Christoph Kittel at the University of Liege, Belgium, showed that if the world warms by 4°C since pre-industrial levels, then 34 per cent of the continent’s ice shelves will have meltwater on their surface, a sign they are at risk of collapse.However, the figure falls to 18 per cent if temperature rises are checked at 2°C. The world is currently on track for a 2.9°C rise but, if implemented, climate plans and net zero goals would cut that to 2.1°C.“Warming to 2°C means half the ice shelf area is at risk of collapsing. That is the message: the less the warming the better,” says Gilbert.She and Kittel used a much higher resolution climate model than previous research, with grid squares 35 kilometers across rather than hundreds of kilometers across. It also more accurately represents cloud physics, which is vital as estimates of the area at risk of collapse hinge on how much ice loss is replaced by snowfall. The big difference between the 2°C and 4°C rise scenarios stems from melting outweighing increased snowfall in a 4°C warmer world.The Larsen C ice shelf on the east of the Antarctic Peninsula, where a huge iceberg broke off in 2017, was found to be one of the areas most at risk.“This study shows melting at the ice shelves’ surface will spread southwards to parts of the continent where huge reservoirs of inland ice may lose their protective barrier. If that happens, we can expect rapid increases in sea level rise along every coastline of our planet,” says Andrew Shepherd at the University of Leeds, UK, who wasn’t involved with the paper.The research doesn’t put a figure on how much sea level rise could occur if ice shelves collapsed and released the glaciers behind them. However, Gilbert says: “My gut feeling is for 4°C it could potentially contribute tens of centimeters if they did collapse.” Avoiding 10 centimeters of sea level rise should expose 10 million fewer people globally to flooding risks.Helene Seroussi at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, who wasn’t part of the research team, says the study’s big advance is using a higher resolution model. While the research identifies ice shelves that could be hydrofractured, Seroussi says further analysis of how individual ice shelves move – the “dynamical stress regime” – is needed to work out which ones will actually collapse.1. What impact of climate change is presented in the given article?2. According to the computer model made by Gilbert and Kittel, what will happen if the world warms by 4ºC?3. How will you elaborate the statement made by Gilbert, “the less the warming, the better”?4. What are the possible impacts to the environment and mankind if the ice shelves collapse?5. In your opinion, how may the people help to lessen the effect of climate change?​</a>

                            9. The world is constantly changing. This proves that the only thing constant in this world is change. And to keep abreast with the changes around us, one must also upgrade one's self every now and then. One of the best ways to do this is to learn new skills, whether it is for personal development or for an opportunity of finding a better career. To be able to do this, one can attend training programs which provide fresh knowledge; learn new skills on his present job with the help of his co-workers; be open to supervisors/ colleagues for coaching and mentoring; read new developments, trends, and innovations that are related to one's job; and join forums on-line which will provide a wider source of newer information relating to one's job or profession. Upgrading one's knowledge and skills is beneficial as it helps in increasing a person's self-confidence, improves competitiveness leading to a greater chance of being hired or promoted, develops creativeness which contributes to productiveness, and opens doors for better and wider career opportunities. Most jobs today are adapting to the changes that is brought by technological trends and advancement. Thus, one must also be able to adapt and be up-to-date with the developments and trends that has something to do with their job. II. EXERCISES Read the following situations below and briefly answer the questions that follow. Choose among the following ways: attend training programs, learn new skills, coaching and mentoring of supervisor/ colleagues, read new developments, trends, and innovations, join forums on-line. 1. Juan works in a bakery that produces goods manually. Everyday, he always runs out of stock. How will he increase his production to meet the daily needs of his customers? 2.

                            10. A. William Henry Gates III (Bill) was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. Bill was the second of three children in an upper-middle class family. He enjoyed playing games with the family and was very competitive. He also loved to read. Bill became bored in public school, so his family sent him to Lakeside School, a private school, where he excelled in math and science and did well in drama and English. Gates became interested in computer programming when he was 13, during the era of giant mainframe computers. His school held a fund-raiser to purchase a teletype terminal so students could use computer time that was donated by General Electric. Using this time, Gates wrote a tic-tac-toe program using BASIC, one of the first computer languages. Later he created a computer version of Risk, a board game he liked in which the goal is world domination. At Lakeside, Bill met Paul Allen, who shared his interest in computers. Gates and Allen and two other students hacked into a computer belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) to get free computer time but were caught. After a period of probation, they were allowed back in the computer lab when they offered to fix glitches in CCC’s software. At age 17, Gates and Allen were paid $20,000 for a program called Traf-O-Data that was used to count traffic. In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the SAT and was accepted by Harvard University. Steve Ballmer, who became CEO of Microsoft after Bill retired, was also a Harvard student. Meanwhile, Paul Allen dropped out of Washington College to work on computers at Honeywell Corporation and convinced Gates to drop out of Harvard and join him in starting a new software company in Albuquerque, New Mexico. They called it Micro-Soft. This was soon changed to Microsoft, and they moved their company to Bellevue, Washington. In 1980, IBM, one of the largest technology companies of the era, asked Microsoft to write software to run their new personal computer, the IBM PC. Microsoft kept the licensing rights for the operating system (MS-DOS) so that they earned money for every computer sold first by IBM, and later by all the other companies that made PC computers. Microsoft grew quickly from 25 employees in 1978 to over 90,000 today. Over the years, Microsoft developed many new technologies and some of the world’s most popular software and products such as Word and PowerPoint. Although some have criticized Gates for using questionable business practices, he built Microsoft into one of the largest companies in the world. He has been described as brilliant but childlike, driven, competitive, intense, fun, but lacking in empathy. Bill Gates is one of the richest men in the world. In 2012, his $61 billion in assets made him the world's second richest man according to Forbes Magazine. In 2006, Gates announced that he would cut back his involvement at Microsoft to spend more time on philanthropy and his foundation. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports many causes including the quest to eradicate polio, fighting AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis; providing vaccinations for children; and even reinventing the toilet, among many other things. 1.

(2pts each) Since the COVID -19 pandemic has disrupted the normal lifestyle of people across the globe, the virtual world has come to the rescue. Amongst many institutions schools have also shifted their base to virtual platforms to conduct classes online. Students and teachers also have their own struggles while accessing these online platforms. Due to financial constraints, students are not able to access the internet, and are devoid of electronic gadgets and laptop, phone or computer or even radio and TV. Those students who have facilities to attend to online classes face barriers in terms of unavailability of physical space, which is equally applicable to teachers who are supposed to conduct online classes from their home.

It filled an entire room. Three people made the computer and programmed Math problems for it. On June 19, 1948, the computer solved its first Math problem - in 52 minutes! At that time this was amazing. Computer are now much smaller. With touch screen technology, many computers don't need extra things, like a keyboard or a mouse. In the future, computers probably won't need this thing at all. Some computers, like smartphone can fit in one hand. Computers also more powerful today. There is more computing power in a smartphone than there was in all of the computers on Apollo 11, the first spacecraft to take people to the moon. How else will computers change in the future? A computer's "brain" is a chip inside the computer, and in the future, people will definitely be able to save much more information on a computer chip. So, computers will be smaller and even more powerful. Perhaps they even think like humans! Maybe we won't need to tell computers what to do because they'll decide for themselves..

                            16. College students are often considered a bellwether of Internet use, but the Internet is not the only technology they have incorporated into everyday life. Thanks to a plethora of technologies (video game consoles, computers, handheld devices, Internet) a range of entertainment options is at their disposal, a range that is much wider than was available to their predecessors. Furthermore, today’s college students are using technologies like cell phones, mp3 players and other devices to entertain themselves wherever they may be. The goal of this study was to learn about college students’ use of video, computer and online games, and to determine the impact of that use on their everyday life. To meet those goals the researchers used three approaches. First, surveys were randomly distributed to college students at a wide range of two-year and four-year public and private colleges and universities in the continental United States. Students from 27 colleges and universities participated and the surveys were collected between March 2002 and June 2002, and September 2002 and October 2002. This sample was intended to produce results that would correspond to the demographics for all U.S. college students as reported in The Chronicle of Higher Education’s annual almanac issue.10 The sample was tested against known population parameters (gender, race, age) and found to be reflective of the national population of college students. In all, 1,162 surveys were returned. For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling and other random effects is plus or minus 3 percentage points. This study focused on traditional college students, ones who are seeking a college degree and who devote much or all of their time to their studies. Second, a team of graduate student researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago was recruited to observe the behaviors of college students at 10 Chicago area institutions of higher education. The researchers were trained in ethnographic methods of observation and data collecting, and rotated the times of the day and days of the week they spent in various public settings where college students could be found using computers and the Internet. Third, additional material was based on a previous study of college students’ Internet use conducted by this research team for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project11 and on the findings of surveys of Americans about their use of the Internet conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates in 2001 and 2002 for the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project.1.

Read the news article below and answer the questions that follow.Around a third of the ice shelves holding back huge glaciers in Antarctica are at risk of collapse if the world fails to take sufficient action on climate change, new projections have found.The ice shelves circling the continent are vulnerable to meltwater on their surface causing the ice to crack and disintegrate, a process known as hydrofracturing.Computer modelling by Ella Gilbert at the University of Reading, UK, and Christoph Kittel at the University of Liege, Belgium, showed that if the world warms by 4°C since pre-industrial levels, then 34 per cent of the continent’s ice shelves will have meltwater on their surface, a sign they are at risk of collapse.However, the figure falls to 18 per cent if temperature rises are checked at 2°C. The world is currently on track for a 2.9°C rise but, if implemented, climate plans and net zero goals would cut that to 2.1°C.“Warming to 2°C means half the ice shelf area is at risk of collapsing. That is the message: the less the warming the better,” says Gilbert.She and Kittel used a much higher resolution climate model than previous research, with grid squares 35 kilometres across rather than hundreds of kilometres across. It also more accurately represents cloud physics, which is vital as estimates of the area at risk of collapse hinge on how much ice loss is replaced by snowfall. The big difference between the 2°C and 4°C rise scenarios stems from melting outweighing increased snowfall in a 4°C warmer world.The Larsen C ice shelf on the east of the Antarctic Peninsula, where a huge iceberg broke off in 2017, was found to be one of the areas most at risk.“This study shows melting at the ice shelves’ surface will spreads southwards to parts of the continent where huge reservoirs of inland ice may lose their protective barrier. If that happens, we can expect rapid increases in sea level rise along every coastline of our planet,” says Andrew Shepherd at the University of Leeds, UK, who wasn’t involved with the paper.The research doesn’t put a figure on how much sea level rise could occur if ice shelves collapsed and released the glaciers behind them. However, Gilbert says: “My gut feeling is for 4°C it could potentially contribute tens of centimetres if they did collapse.” Avoiding 10 centimetres of sea level rise should expose 10 million fewer people globally to flooding risks.Helene Seroussi at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, who wasn’t part of the research team, says the study’s big advance is using a higher resolution model. While the research identifies ice shelves that could be hydrofractured, Seroussi says further analysis of how individual ice shelves move – the “dynamical stress regime” – is needed to work out which ones will actually collapse.1.
