affected?
Is a research still valid even when the instrument was implemented
unethically? Why?
How can one tell that a research is unethical? Give at least three signs.

                        <p><strong>Everyone </strong>is impacted by a researcher's failure to uphold ethics because it <strong>compromises both the scientific enterprise</strong> as a whole and the public's perception of science.</p><p>     Everyone is affected, in general, because it jeopardizes both the public's perception of science and the scientific endeavor as a whole. In order to ascertain who is affected and how, it would also be important to detail the circumstances of the ethical infraction under investigation. Study ethics sets the moral standards for scientists who conduct research. Adherence to ethical standards is necessary to respect study participants' rights, dignity, and well-being. An ethics committee should review each study involving human subjects to ensure that the appropriate ethical standards are being followed. Discussion of the ethical principles of beneficence, fairness, and autonomy is the main goal of ethical review. The study would no longer be legitimate. Because how we/you conduct a research demonstrates how much emphasis we/you place on the value of ethics, we/you must conduct it with respect and thoughtfulness. According to the USPHS Policy, research misconduct is "falsification, plagiarism, or fabrication in the proposing, doing, or reviewing of research, or in the reporting of research results." <strong>Falsification </strong>is the manipulation of research materials, equipment, or processes, or the changing or omitting of data or results so that the research is not accurately represented in the research record. <strong>Fabrication </strong>is the creation of data or results and recording or reporting them. <strong>Plagiarism </strong>is the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit. Honest mistakes or sincere differences of opinion are not considered research misconduct. Tampering involves the unauthorized removal or modification of College records (such as library books, reference materials, official institutional forms, and correspondence), software, equipment, or other academic-related items, including other students' work. It should be emphasized that tampering as a type of cheating may also be viewed as illegal behavior and be the subject of legal action. ripping out the pages of a journal article from the library; altering a student's academic record, a letter of recommendation, or another official college record; purposefully undermining another student's work; electronically altering the files, data, assignments, or reports of a fellow student or colleague. The unauthorized duplication of copyrighted materials, including software and other non-print media, is against academic integrity. Individuals are permitted to copy articles or brief passages of books for their own use under the legal idea of "fair use," as well as to use an image to illustrate a point. Copyright infringement include, for example: Making or distributing copies of a copyrighted material for a group (on paper or electronically); Sharing a video or image of an artist's creation without authorization (such a Netter® or Adam® anatomical sketch); Copies of lengthy books. <strong>Research ethics</strong> are important for a number of reasons. They promote the aims of research, such as expanding knowledge. They support the values required for collaborative work, such as mutual respect and fairness. This is essential because scientific research depends on collaboration between researchers and groups</p><p>Misconduct in Research and Other Unethical Behavior</p>Reporting erroneous details in order to obtain an advantage;Missing information or data that causes findings or conclusions to be misrepresented or distorted;Giving bogus justifications for being absent or excused from a task, a lesson, or a clerkship;<p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>Research</strong>: https://brainly.in/question/24094718</p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />

                        <p>Yes I already did experience an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>I was 13 years old back then. I was sleeping in my house, having bunked the republic day celebrations at school. The 2nd term examinations had just ended a day earlier and I just wanted to sleep. My parents were invited at a family friend's place for breakfast and they allowed me to take a holiday and rest in.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly the whole house started shaking. I tried getting up but couldn't. My sister shouted from the other room to come out. I made my way out of my room with great difficulty. The house was in a mess. All the kitchen items were on the floor. All the food that was kept in the fridge spilled out. I met my sister near the hall and along with my grandfather we came out of the house.</p><p></p><p>The moment we came out we heard a big loud sound and we saw the adjacent building had come down. I started crying. I had friends in that building and I was too much in shock to understand what was hapoening.</p><p></p><p>Just then my sister asked,</p><p></p><p>“Do you know where mummy papa have gone?”</p><p></p><p>I replied in the negative. My heart started racing. All the people were out on the streets and nobody wanted to go back inside. My sister suggested she would go look for our parents and told me to be strong and look after my grandfather.</p><p></p><p>Before my sister could leave we saw our parents returning. Thankfully they were alright. The few things that are still etched in my memory after so many years are,</p><p></p><p>People risking their lives to take out debris and trying to help out people who were stuck and couldn't move. In one such instance there was a man who kept talking to a woman stuck inside till the fire brigade came to rescue her. She had lost hope as she her husband lay beside her dead. The man kept motivating her that there is more to life.</p><p>Then there were people who rummaged inside the debris just to find some cash or jewellery. People took whatever valuable items they could find.</p><p>A friend of mine lost her right hand when a whole part of the lift fell upon her. She was rescued 24 hours later.</p><p>Families who were lucky to have survived helped others selflessly. Food was shared among those who were waiting for their loved one to make it out of the debris alive.</p><p>A pregnant woman in our locality had twins on that day. She named them ‘Erica’ and ‘Eric’. They must be 16 year olds now.</p><p>There were stories about people who escaped death by few seconds. A man was pushed and forced by his wife to go and wash his car. The moment he stepped out of his house he felt the earthquake and his whole building was razed to the ground.</p><p>Many pet owners shared their experiences of how they were warned by the pets to come out of their houses even before the earthquake happened.</p><p>An NRI couple in our neighbourhood had come to India after 20 years. They died while their relatives survived.</p><p>All the public gardens and parks were packed with people at night who were to too scared to go back in their houses to sleep.</p><p>My whole family slept in the hall, close to the main door with an emergency bag ready. It contained 2 pairs of clothes each, cash and jewellery that we had and all the documents needed.</p><p>We were the lucky ones who had not lost anything or anyone. I can't describe how it changed me. I had a new found respect for my life. At just 13 I realised I was lucky enough to be alive. And also for the fact that I still had my family with me. Family is everything.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>Media and information literacy are crucial skills for navigating the vast landscape of information and media in today's world. However, not everyone possesses these skills, which can lead to misinformation and discrimination. As a media and information literate individual, it is important to approach fellow citizens who are misinformed or discriminatory in a respectful and understanding manner.</p><p></p><p>One effective approach is to first listen to their perspective and try to understand where they are coming from. This can help establish a sense of trust and make it easier to engage in a constructive dialogue. Then, provide them with factual information and credible sources to counter their misinformation. It is important to remain calm and patient, as attacking or belittling someone will only make them more defensive and resistant to change.</p><p></p><p>For example, suppose a fellow citizen believes that COVID-19 vaccines are harmful and refuse to get vaccinated. In that case, it would be essential to understand their concerns and provide them with credible scientific evidence that proves the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. Moreover, it is important to address the sources of their misinformation and explain how to differentiate between credible and unreliable sources.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, if someone makes discriminatory remarks about a particular group of people, it is essential to challenge their assumptions and provide them with factual information. For instance, if someone believes that all immigrants are criminals, it is important to highlight the contributions that immigrants make to society and how they have positively impacted various aspects of the economy.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, media and information literacy is essential for creating an informed and tolerant society. As a media and information literate individual, it is important to engage in constructive dialogue with fellow citizens who are misinformed or discriminatory. By listening to their perspectives, providing them with factual information, and challenging their assumptions, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting society.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We sometimes hear our friends say when they’re angry with someone, “Ka-karmahin din yan” or “Karmahin ka sana.” But when they tell it that way, they think of it as some sort of curse or bad luck happening on the person concerned. If we put it that way, they are actually saying, “Malasin ka sana.” As if the God they believe in will punish that person for doing them wrong. But that is not the case. For those who don’t believe in God, you know why.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the wrongdoers don’t always get what they deserve. We might see a few who are punished publicly but that’s it. But why be invested in what is happening to your enemies? For now, let us focus on our Personal karma.</p><p></p><p>For those unfamiliar with karma, the first thing you have to know is that we are born with karma. The environment you were born into is part of your karma. That is the start of your karma. And for people who believe in reincarnation, your current life is just a continuation of your karma from a previous life or lives. Putting an end to personal karma is a part of the work of Buddhists.</p><p></p><p>You must realize that you are not alone and there are other people in this world with you. Everybody is creating his/her own karma that affects the rest of us. For example, Person A murders Person B. It is Person A’s karma that led to him being murdered. Then it is the Person B’s karma that leads him to be sent to jail.</p><p></p><p>Karma means that our actions bring about consequences that affect us in the long run. “You reap what you sow” as they say. Think about it, every move we make will start a chain of events that will keep on going through everybody until it reaches us again. I guess it is similar to Chaos Theory. That’s just my opinion.</p><p></p><p>Karma is not done by some supernatural force that chooses to give it to you when it wants to although when karma gets you, you won’t be able to escape it. It was just meant to happen that way to you. So what must we do? The only way is to change your bad karma into good karma. If you don’t then you will continue to make bad karma for yourself. Karma will not feel like a single event and it is not totally your fault. It is the result of a combination of many different factors, you and your environment. Karma is neither good nor bad, it is an experience that just does what it is supposed to do in your life. And it is up to you to try to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>Karma can also be applied to any group. The actions of each member contribute to the karma of the group. You might notice that your Family has its own karma. Higher than that is the karma of your Community. Next to it is the Country karma. Our beloved Philippines is now feeling the effects of the karma produced by the past generations. The last is the karma of the whole planet. So create good karma for others and not just yourself.</p><p></p><p>If we don’t do something about our own karma, others will continue to suffer as a result of our ignorance. We can find a way out of our ignorance by being better informed of what is going on around us. Learn to anticipate different situations that may come. Make friends with the right kind of people who really know. And lastly, get to know yourself as an individual human being apart from the people around you so you can put your whole trust in yourself. Do something about your life.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>There are several individuals who have had a significant influence on my attitude, values, and behaviors as an adolescent. One of them is my parents, who have always been supportive and encouraging, and have taught me the value of hard work and responsibility. They have also instilled in me the importance of honesty, integrity, and respect for others. Another significant individual is my teacher, who has not only taught me academic subjects, but has also guided me in developing important life skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving. She has also encouraged me to be open-minded and to value diversity and inclusion.It is important for adolescents to learn about Filipino social values because these values shape the culture and society in which they live. They provide a foundation for how we interact with others and make decisions in our daily lives. Learning about these values helps adolescents understand the expectations and norms of their community, and it helps them develop a sense of belonging and connection to their culture. It can also help adolescents develop a sense of responsibility towards their community and towards others, which is important for their personal and social development.Other people's evaluation of ourselves is important because it helps us understand how we are perceived by others and how we fit into our social environment. It can also serve as a source of feedback and help us identify areas for improvement. However, it is important to remember that other people's evaluations are just one perspective and should not be the sole determinant of our self-worth. It is also important to balance other people's evaluations with our own self-evaluation, as this can help us develop a more well-rounded and accurate understanding of ourselves.One example of a Filipino social value that can be observed up to the present is the value of pakikipagkapwa-tao, which refers to the importance of being considerate and empathetic towards others. This value is evident in the way Filipinos often prioritize the needs and feelings of others, and in the way they often value relationships and social connections. This value can be seen in the way Filipinos often extend hospitality and generosity to others, and in the way they often value harmony and peaceful resolution of conflicts.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            22. 1. The CoViD-19 pandemic has caused some anti-Chinese resentment in social media, with certain people blaming the Chinese people for the spread, calling them racist names (ching- chong). In the US, there is also The Black Lives Matter movement which sparked because of the killing of African- American by members of the police.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In recent years, there have been several instances of non-inclusive behavior that need to be corrected. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment, with some people blaming the Chinese people for the spread of the virus. This has resulted in racist name-calling, discrimination, and even physical attacks against people of Chinese descent. This behavior is not only unjustified but also unhelpful in tackling the pandemic, as it divides people and undermines efforts to work together to find solutions.</p><p></p><p>The Black Lives Matter movement also highlights the need for greater inclusivity and respect for diversity. The movement sparked in response to the killing of African-Americans by members of the police, and draws attention to the systemic racism and discrimination that many people of color face. This movement has led to calls for greater police accountability, social justice, and equal rights for all people, regardless of their race or ethnicity.</p><p></p><p>In my observation, I have also noticed instances of non-inclusive behavior in my own community. For example, I have seen people make insensitive jokes or comments about individuals with disabilities or mental health conditions. I have also witnessed people making assumptions or stereotyping others based on their gender, religion, or sexual orientation.</p><p></p><p>To correct these non-inclusive behaviors, it is important to promote greater awareness and understanding of diversity and inclusion. This can be done through education, community outreach programs, and initiatives that promote tolerance and respect for different cultures and perspectives. It is also important to hold individuals and organizations accountable for any discriminatory behavior or practices, and to provide support and resources to those who have been affected by such behavior.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, non-inclusive behavior remains a persistent problem in many communities. It is important to recognize and address these issues, and to work towards a more inclusive and respectful society. By promoting diversity and inclusion, we can create a more harmonious and equitable world for all people.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Kindly hit the thanks button.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, there are several things that Filipinos should do to protect themselves and their communities.</p><p></p><p>First, it is important to follow guidelines from health authorities and practice good hygiene, such as washing hands frequently and wearing a mask in public settings. This can help prevent the spread of the virus and protect oneself and others.</p><p></p><p>Second, it is important to stay informed about the latest updates and recommendations related to the pandemic. This may include following the news and checking reliable sources such as government websites or health organizations.</p><p></p><p>Third, it is important to follow social distancing guidelines, such as staying at least 6 feet away from others and avoiding large gatherings. This can help reduce the risk of transmission and protect vulnerable populations.</p><p></p><p>Fourth, it is important to support and care for others, especially those who may be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, such as older adults and people with underlying health conditions. This may include offering to run errands or provide other forms of assistance.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it is important to practice self-care and manage stress during this difficult time. This may include finding ways to stay connected with others, engaging in activities that bring joy and relaxation, and seeking support if needed.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Filipinos should practice good hygiene, stay informed, follow social distancing guidelines, support and care for others, and practice self-care.

                            28. How should a media and information literate individual address fellow citizens who are misinformed or discriminatory?Provide necessary Examples and situations to prove your point. ​observe the introduction of the essay body and the conclusion​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction: In today's society, misinformed or discriminatory views are becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly in the age of social media. As a media and information literate individual, it is important to know how to address such issues in a respectful and constructive manner. In this essay, we will discuss how to effectively communicate with fellow citizens who hold such views and provide examples of how to do so.</p><p></p><p>Body: The first step in addressing misinformed or discriminatory views is to remain calm and respectful. It is important to avoid attacking or belittling those with opposing views, as this can only cause further tension and hostility. Instead, try to understand where they are coming from and the reasons behind their beliefs.</p><p></p><p>One effective strategy is to provide accurate and credible information to counteract any misinformation they may have received. This can be done by sharing reliable sources or statistics that support your argument. For instance, if someone holds a discriminatory view towards a certain race or religion, you can provide them with facts that demonstrate the positive contributions that this group has made to society.</p><p></p><p>Another strategy is to use personal stories or experiences to connect with the individual on a more emotional level. This can help to humanize those who are being discriminated against and can help the individual see things from a different perspective. For example, if someone holds a negative view towards the LGBTQ+ community, you can share a personal story about a friend or family member who identifies as LGBTQ+ and how their experiences have impacted them.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, it is important to remain patient and persistent in your efforts to address misinformed or discriminatory views. Changing someone's beliefs can take time, so it is important to continue the conversation and provide new information or perspectives as necessary.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion: In conclusion, addressing misinformed or discriminatory views requires a careful approach that is rooted in respect and understanding. By providing accurate information, personal stories, and remaining patient, media and information literate individuals can work towards promoting a more tolerant and inclusive society. It is important to remember that change is possible, but it requires effort and persistence.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Don't fool around. ...
</p><p>Never work while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, as you are a hazard to yourself and your co-workers.
</p><p>Pay particular attention to moving objects, such as equipment, dollies, mixers, and slicers.
</p><p>Walk, do not run, in the work areas.
</p><p>Stay completely alert on the job.</p><p>2.Wrinkle resistant.
</p><p>Elastic nature. ...
</p><p>Lightweight. ...
</p><p>Comfortable. ...
</p><p>Most require little care. ...
</p><p>Come in every color. ...
</p><p>Manufacturing process is easier.</p><p>3.These days, the average person’s attention span is surprisingly short. Knitting pushes back against this trend by requiring crafters to sit down and focus on a project for an extended period of time. It’s easy to stay on task when you’re motivated by genuine interest and can see the progress you’re making as you go, and knitting regularly can train your brain to focus better in other situations as well.
</p><p>
</p><p>Knitting also provides a different kind of focus boost for me. Once you’ve developed a basic level of skill, it’s easy to stay engaged with a project while paying attention to something else. If I have to listen to a long online lecture or sit through a slow-paced movie, knitting prevents my mind from wandering and keeps me engaged. If you have difficulty sustaining concentration, a simple knit project might be the solution.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            30. For each of the following situations or questions, indicate which assessment method provides the best match. Then provide a brief explanation why you choose that method of assessment. Choices are selected response, essay, performance-based, oral question, observation and self-report. 1. Mrs. Abad needs to check students to see if they are able to draw graphs correctly like the examples just demonstrated in class Method: Why? 1939 2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Mrs. Abad needs to check students to see if they are able to draw graphs correctly like the examples just demonstrated in class.</p><p>Method: Performance-based assessment</p><p>Why? A performance-based assessment allows Mrs. Abad to observe the students as they demonstrate their skills by actually drawing the graphs, which allows her to see their understanding and ability in action.</p><p></p><p>2. Mr. Garcia wants to see if his students are comprehending the story before moving to the next set of instructional activities.</p><p>Method: Oral questioning or observation</p><p>Why? An oral questioning assessment allows Mr. Garcia to ask the students questions about the story and listen to their responses, which can help him gauge their comprehension. Alternatively, an observation assessment would allow Mr. Garcia to watch the students as they engage with the story and look for signs of comprehension, such as asking questions or making connections to the material.</p><p></p><p>3. Ms. Santos wants to find out how many spelling words her students know.</p><p>Method: Selected response or self-report</p><p>Why? A selected response assessment, such as a multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank test, allows Ms. Santos to quickly and efficiently assess the students' spelling knowledge by providing a list of words for them to spell. Alternatively, a self-report assessment, such as a survey or questionnaire, allows the students to report on their own spelling abilities, which can provide additional information and context.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
