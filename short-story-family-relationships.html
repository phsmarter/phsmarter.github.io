                                            I NEED HELP FOR EXPLAIN THIS WETHER TGALOG OR ENGLISH WORDS:3. Be inquisitive. If your boss is too shy to ask you questions about matters, they think are too personal, you can be more inquisitive than them. Ask them questions about the things you can see in their office like their collection of paintings and the photos of their family on his desk. Engage them in short banter about their country of origin and its people. You may want to tell them an interesting piece of trivia you may know about their country. However, be ready to continue the intelligent conversation that you started. Superiors appreciate staff that ask questions about something special and important to them. When you ask the right questions and engage you're superior in a wonderful conversation, they will be impressed by your sincere interest and hopefully more conversations will happen the two of you as you work together. The good thing about this is that your relationship will go beyond the time you are working together. Many bosses call their favourite staff and invite them to join them in their next assignment somewhere in the world. Being inquisitive can literally take you places around the world. I am a witness to hundreds of Filipinos that have been invited by their former bosses to join them in some of the best countries in the world. Many of them choosing to stay as immigrants in these countries. Many lives have been improved and transformed because of these relationships. The moral of this story is to always engage your bosses' wonderful and intelligent conversations.​</a>

This is most easily evident in the conversation between Alfredo and his fiancée,Esperanza, about Calixta, their note-carrier who grew up in the latter's family. The scene depicts a parallelismin the circumstance of Alfredo and his new love, Julia, and Calixta and her live-in partner. However, while noone blatantly frowns upon the budding relationship between Alfredo and Julia, except for some whisperedrumors that reach Esperanza, Calixta is dubbed" ungrateful to her master for doing such an act. Alfredo doesnot have to answer to anyone for his unfaithfulness, but Calixta is responsible not only for what her familymight think, but also for the members of her master's family. Despite the same circumstances, the two peopleare regarded differently based on their positions in life.ACTIVITY 2After reading the passage above, answer the following questions in your answer sheet.1.

                                            BUYER BEHAVIOUR AND RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH COMPANY TRIES TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR BY LIVING WITH THEIR BEHAVIOUR How can any marketer get inside your mind to understand how you actually make purchase decisions? Structured questionnaire surveys may have a role for collecting large scale factual data, but they have major weaknesses when it comes to understanding individuals' attitudes. Qualitative approaches, such as focus groups can get closer to the truth, but participants often still find themselves inhibited from telling the full story. Many marketing managers, especially those without large research budgets, inevitably end up relying on their own personal experiences to understand how consumers behave. This may be easy for target markets which are in the 20-40 age range (the age of typical marketers), but how do you get inside the mind of teenagers, or elderly people? Ethnographic approaches are becoming increasingly popular among marketers as a means of getting closer to the truth about consumer behaviour. Ethnographic research is nothing new, having been used by anthropologists in their study of the rituals of tribal people. Marketers have been relatively recent converts to the techniques of ethnography. The advertising agency BMP DDB has taken on board the techniques of ethnography in its "Project Keyhole" in a manner which is reminiscent of anthropologists' practice of living with tribes in order to understand them. Its consumer researchers live with a family for several days in order to record their every move. The project is designed to meet the needs of client companies who are looking for more than the data gathered using traditional quantitative and qualitative research techniques. Participants record their views and actions on a digital video camera, in the presence of a researcher who stays with them from 8am until 10pm for a few days.A normal project would last four or five days and the client may be invited along for part of the time. Participants are paid £100 for their troubles. What did they do with the direct mail when it came through the letter box? Did they use the coupon offer which it contained? Who drinks the fresh orange juice in the house? How long do they spend cooking dinner? How do they actually cook the ready-prepared meals they bought earlier? Does the family eat together? These are examples of the vital information that sponsoring companies hope to get hold of in order to position their products more effectively. According to the company, the advantage of this method over conventional research is that it picks up inconsistencies between what people say they are doing and what they actually do. Following them throughout the day allows the researcher to see why a person's habits might change according to random factors such as their mood, the time of day or the weather. Crucially it reveals the quirks in our behaviour that marketers are desperate to gain an insight into. For example, a person's store-card data might tell you that they buy bread and margarine, but it doesn't tell whether they eat the bread fresh, or toast it first before putting margarine on it. In 1998, the magazine Marketing put this novel research method to the test with a guinea pig family called the Jones's. It then compared the results of this approach with more traditional methods of profiling customers. In short, established systems such as CACI, Claritas and Experian might say one thing about the buying behaviour of a family, using lifestyle and electoral roll data, but did they bear any relation to reality? The information that the researcher gathered in a short space of time told a lot about the Jones family. By contrast, the database information about the Joneses, although detailed and often accurate, could not capture the quirks and details that make up the personality of the family. For example, it transpired that the Joneses had a keener than average eye on value for money. Although information on them from the four database companies correctly suggested that they enjoy luxuries like good food and foreign holidays, it didn't say anything about the real life factors that influence their purchasing decisions. The most noticeable of these was that although they like good food, Mrs Jones mixed her shopping between the supermarket and a local discount store which sells cut-price brands. This means that she only bought at Tesco or Sainsbury's what she could not get cheaper elsewhere. She showed the researcher a can of branded plum tomatoes which she got for 10p at the discount store as an example, explaining that it would have cost 26p in the supermarket. Mrs Jones prided herself on being able to hunt down bargains like this and occasionally rewarded herself by buying "something luxurious", such as smoked salmon from Marks &amp; Spencer. ​</a>

Engage them in short banter about their country of origin and its people. You may want to tell them an interesting piece of trivia you may know about their country. However, be ready to continue the intelligent conversation that you started. Superiors appreciate staff that ask questions about something special and important to them. When you ask the right questions and engage you're superior in a wonderful conversation, they will be impressed by your sincere interest and hopefully more conversations will happen the two of you as you work together. The good thing about this is that your relationship will go beyond the time you are working together. Many bosses call their favourite staff and invite them to join them in their next assignment somewhere in the world. Being inquisitive can literally take you places around the world. I am a witness to hundreds of Filipinos that have been invited by their former bosses to join them in some of the best countries in the world. Many of them choosing to stay as immigrants in these countries. Many lives have been improved and transformed because of these relationships. The moral of this story is to always engage your bosses' wonderful and intelligent conversations.​</h2><br />

Ullereaus textRead and study the sample short Marxist criticism of "Dead Stars" below, a classic Filipino short story by PazMarquez BenitezThe imbalanced societal power play is evident in the short story in the form of treatment of thecharacters based on their class. This is most easily evident in the conversation between Alfredo and his fiancée,Esperanza, about Calixta, their note-carrier who grew up in the latter's family. The scene depicts a parallelismin the circumstance of Alfredo and his new love, Julia, and Calixta and her live-in partner. However, while noone blatantly frowns upon the budding relationship between Alfredo and Julia, except for some whisperedrumors that reach Esperanza, Calixta is dubbed" ungrateful to her master for doing such an act. Alfredo doesnot have to answer to anyone for his unfaithfulness, but Calixta is responsible not only for what her familymight think, but also for the members of her master's family. Despite the same circumstances, the two peopleare regarded differently based on their positions in life.ACTIVITY 2After reading the passage above, answer the following questions in your answer sheet.1.

BUYER BEHAVIOUR AND RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH COMPANY TRIES TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR BY LIVING WITH THEIR BEHAVIOUR How can any marketer get inside your mind to understand how you actually make purchase decisions?

Qualitative approaches, such as focus groups can get closer to the truth, but participants often still find themselves inhibited from telling the full story. Many marketing managers, especially those without large research budgets, inevitably end up relying on their own personal experiences to understand how consumers behave.

Ethnographic research is nothing new, having been used by anthropologists in their study of the rituals of tribal people.

Participants are paid £100 for their troubles. What did they do with the direct mail when it came through the letter box? Did they use the coupon offer which it contained? Who drinks the fresh orange juice in the house? How long do they spend cooking dinner? How do they actually cook the ready-prepared meals they bought earlier? Does the family eat together? These are examples of the vital information that sponsoring companies hope to get hold of in order to position their products more effectively. According to the company, the advantage of this method over conventional research is that it picks up inconsistencies between what people say they are doing and what they actually do. Following them throughout the day allows the researcher to see why a person's habits might change according to random factors such as their mood, the time of day or the weather.

This means that she only bought at Tesco or Sainsbury's what she could not get cheaper elsewhere. She showed the researcher a can of branded plum tomatoes which she got for 10p at the discount store as an example, explaining that it would have cost 26p in the supermarket. Mrs Jones prided herself on being able to hunt down bargains like this and occasionally rewarded herself by buying "something luxurious", such as smoked salmon from Marks &amp; Spencer. ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"Dead Stars" by Paz Marquez Benitez is a beautifully written story that delves into the themes of love and society's expectations. The author uses the character of Alfredo Salazar to explore the complexities of love and how it can easily be mistaken for infatuation. The story is set in a time where one's social status played a significant role in determining their life choices. This societal pressure is evident in the way Alfredo is torn between his love for Esperanza and his attraction to Julia.</p><p></p><p>The character of Alfredo Salazar is relatable in many respects. He is depicted as a man who believes in the concept of true love and is optimistic about life. This trait is laudable, but at the same time, it makes him vulnerable to misunderstanding his own feelings. His love for Esperanza is sincere, but he fails to see that her lack of passion is not a flaw, but a personality trait. His attraction to Julia is also genuine, but he fails to realize that his decision to pursue her would hurt Esperanza deeply. This internal conflict that Alfredo wrestles with is what makes the story engaging.</p><p></p><p>The women characters in the story are also well crafted. Esperanza and Julia represent two different aspects of the society they live in. Esperanza embodies the ideal woman of her time - reserved, subservient, and focused on her domestic duties. Julia, on the other hand, is a woman who has dreams and aspirations beyond the confines of societal expectations. The fact that Alfredo is attracted to both women, albeit for different reasons, highlights the tension between traditional and modern norms.</p><p></p><p>"Dead Stars" is also notable for its setting. The story takes place in the early 1900s when the Philippines was under American occupation. This historical background adds another layer to the story, as it highlights the impact of colonization on the Filipino way of life. The author uses the contrast between the old and new ways of living to drive home the theme of change.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, "Dead Stars" is a well-written story that explores themes of love, society, and change. The author's characterization of Alfredo Salazar and the women in his life is nuanced, and the historical setting adds another dimension to the story. Paz Marquez Benitez's writing style is engaging, and she does an excellent job of capturing the complexities of human emotions. Overall, "Dead Stars" is a must-read for anyone interested in Philippine literature.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po :)</p><br />
