                                            II. TAKE MY ORDER Directions: Arrange the following paragraphs from A to E to form an introduction. A. Absenteeism among Fourth Year Students of Lipa City National High School ______1. In Lipa City National High School, about 6.34 percent or 60 out of 946 fourth year students are habitually absent during the month of August, September and October. _____2. The frequent absences of the students affect their academic performance therefore, in order to identify the possible causes of absences among fourth year students and to minimize truancy, the researcher conducts an investigation. _____3. Student absenteeism (McCluskey et. al., 2005) is a strong predictor of undesirable outcomes in adolescence, including academic failure, dropping out of school, substance abuse, gang involvement, and criminal activity. However, absenteeism is increasingly identified as an important "early warning sign" that a student is at risk for school failure and early dropout. ______4. As shown by the Guidance office records, a recorded number of absences everyday range to a total of 25 to 35 students. This is alarming on the part of the teachers and administrators since they are graduating students._____ 5. Absenteeism is a very alarming problem for administrators, teachers, parents and the society in general, as well as for the students in particular. As a result, students who are not able to finish their studies may end up as a liability of the community and the country as a whole.​</a>

He wants to know if it is true in the town where he teaches. He randomly selected 250 respondents. He finds out that the drop-out rate of the respondents is 23.7% with a standard deviation of 1.02%. What can the teacher conclude about the accuracy of the news at 0.01 level of significance? 2.) A new established restaurant in the city claims that the waiting time for customers is less than 10 minutes. Fifty randomly selected customers have reported an average waiting time of 13 minutes with a standard deviation of 2.5 minutes. At 0.05 level of significance, what can you conclude about the restaurant's claim? 3.) A researcher believes that it costs more than Php 150 000 to send a college student in a private school per year. The researcher takes a random sample of 50 families who had sent their child in private school universities to see if his claim is true. It reveals that the mean expenses of these families are Php 160 000 with a standard deviation of Php 5 000. Can it be concluded that the researcher is correct in his claim at 0.05 level of significance? Reflection: Note: Practice Personal Hygiene protocols at all times.​</a>

                            2. II. TAKE MY ORDER Directions: Arrange the following paragraphs from A to E to form an introduction. A. Absenteeism among Fourth Year Students of Lipa City National High School ______1. In Lipa City National High School, about 6.34 percent or 60 out of 946 fourth year students are habitually absent during the month of August, September and October. _____2. The frequent absences of the students affect their academic performance therefore, in order to identify the possible causes of absences among fourth year students and to minimize truancy, the researcher conducts an investigation. _____3. Student absenteeism (McCluskey et. al., 2005) is a strong predictor of undesirable outcomes in adolescence, including academic failure, dropping out of school, substance abuse, gang involvement, and criminal activity. However, absenteeism is increasingly identified as an important "early warning sign" that a student is at risk for school failure and early dropout. ______4. As shown by the Guidance office records, a recorded number of absences everyday range to a total of 25 to 35 students. This is alarming on the part of the teachers and administrators since they are graduating students._____ 5. Absenteeism is a very alarming problem for administrators, teachers, parents and the society in general, as well as for the students in particular. As a result, students who are not able to finish their studies may end up as a liability of the community and the country as a whole.​</h2><br />

d. Amount of water in each cup, method of stirring, time when the solid is added to water, how long each solution is stirred. 
8. What is the dependent variable (what is being measured)? 
The temperature of water. 
The amount of sugar. 
The length of time that sugar completely dissolves in hot water. 
The length of time that sugar completely dissolves in cold water. 
a. I only 
b. II only 
c. II and III 
d. III and IV 
9. What is the independent variable in the investigation? 
a. I only 
c. I, II and III 
b. II and III 
d. II, III and IV 
10. Why is the Scientific Method an important process in doing experiments? 
a. It takes more work but it’s worth it. 
b. It helps the experiment to take longer and be better. 
c. It ensures that the results can be trusted and repeated. 
d. It ensures that the people doing the experiments are scientific. 
For items 11-15: You want to prove that trees lower the air temperature under the leaves 
because of the shade. You stand under the tree, hold out an air 
thermometer under the shade for a few minutes, and record the air 
temperature. You then move to an area where there are no trees and 
record the air temperature. 
11. What is the experimental setup? 
12. What is the control setup? 
13. What is the idependent variable? 
14. What is the dependent variable? 
15. What factors will you keep constant?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>0</strong><strong> </strong><strong>The scientific method attempts to minimize the influence of bias or prejudice in the experimenter. Even the best-intentioned scientists can't escape bias. That's the job of the scientific method. It provides an objective, standardized approach to conducting experiments and, in doing so, improves their results.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>1</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Experimental Setup In this section you describe how the experiment was done and summarize the data taken. One typically describes the instruments and detectors used in this section. Describe the procedure followed to collect the data. If the experiment is complex, the procedure m</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>ght be described in a separate section.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>2</strong><strong> </strong><strong>A control setup in a scientific experiment is separate from the main experiment and is a setup in which the independent variable under investigation cannot affect the results. This isolates the effect of the independent variable and helps eliminate alternative explanations of the investigation results.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>3</strong><strong> </strong><strong>An independent variable is exactly what it sounds like. It is a variable that stands alone and isn't changed by the other variables you are trying to measure. For example, someone's age might be an independent variable.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>4</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Just like an independent variable, a dependent variable is exactly what it sounds like. It is something that depends on other factors. Usually when you are looking for a relationship between two things you are trying to find out what makes the dependent variable change the way it does.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>5</strong><strong> </strong><strong>The factors that can change value during an experiment or between experiments, such as water temperature, are called variables, while those that stay the same, such as acceleration due to gravity at a certain location, are called </strong><strong>constants</strong></p><br />

better than their household detergent. The student performed the same

strongly opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb on moral,
technological, economic, and political grounds, and persuaded other
outstanding scientists not to work on it.

research on black holes and advanced cosmology, suffered from amyotrophic
