                                            When was the last time you've watched Maalaala Mo Kaya (MMK)? Perhaps, you were able to watch the episode entitled "Bangka" that talks about the struggle of a young girl who was so motivated to reach her dreams of finishing her studies despite her family's experience of extreme poverty. As a student, she would regularly brace the danger of swimming in an open sea just to arrive at school. I can still remember even today how my heart somehow "felt" the girl's own emotions as sho constantly struggled because of her dream, even if that story is never my own and that I do not know her personally.

Perhaps, you were able to watch the episode entitled "Bangka" that talks about the struggle of a young girl who was so motivated to reach her dreams of finishing her studies despite her family's experience of extreme poverty. As a student, she would regularly brace the danger of swimming in an open sea just to arrive at school. I can still remember even today how my heart somehow "felt" the girl's own emotions as she constantly struggled because of her dream, even if that story is never my own and that I do not know her personally.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Transcendence</strong> is defined as the act of rising above something to a higher state of being. Transcendence comes from the Latin prefix trans-, meaning "<strong>beyond</strong>," and the word scandare, meaning "<strong>to climb.</strong>" When you reach transcendence, you have gone beyond ordinary limitations.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>
According to Abraham Maslow, <strong>self-transcendence</strong> carries the person to what he termed as “peak experiences” in which they <strong>transcend</strong> their own individual concerns and look at it from a higher perspective. These experiences will always bring strong positive emotions like joy, peace, and a well-developed sense of awareness  </p><p>
</p><strong>Being absent for a week due to fever</strong> is a biological limitation for transcendence for a student whose goal is to be a valedictorian
<strong> Looking for help </strong>is not a possibility for transcendence  Because Magie is a poor 17-year old girl whose ultimate dream is to finish her studies,<strong> she can work during her free time to gain extra money for school</strong> to make her dream possible.

                            20. When was the last time you've watched Maalaala Mo Kaya (MMK)? Perhaps, you were able to watch the episode entitled "Bangka" that talks about the struggle of a young girl who was so motivated to reach her dreams of finishing her studies despite her family's experience of extreme poverty. As a student, she would regularly brace the danger of swimming in an open sea just to arrive at school. I can still remember even today how my heart somehow "felt" the girl's own emotions as sho constantly struggled because of her dream, even if that story is never my own and that I do not know her personally. Have you also experienced something similar to this? What was it like? Write your thoughts or feelings about this on the space below:​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> We've been on a same experience but I do not use bangka just to go in school. I need to wake up early just not to be late in my school. Our school's flag ceremony is 5:45 am so I need to wake up early,4:00 am because our house is too far. I know her feeling that she's sacrificing because she wants to have learnings and she wants to finish studies. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>good luck!</p><br />

                            26. When was the last time you've watched Maalaala Mo Kaya (MMK)? Perhaps, you were able to watch the episode entitled "Bangka" that talks about the struggle of a young girl who was so motivated to reach her dreams of finishing her studies despite her family's experience of extreme poverty. As a student, she would regularly brace the danger of swimming in an open sea just to arrive at school. I can still remember even today how my heart somehow "felt" the girl's own emotions as she constantly struggled because of her dream, even if that story is never my own and that I do not know her personally.
