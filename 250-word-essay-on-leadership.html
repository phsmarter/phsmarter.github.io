                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>-   Leadership is the art of motivating a group of people to act toward achieving a common goal. In a business setting, this can mean directing workers and colleagues with a strategy to meet the company's needs. It doesn't matter who's the boss, but how you treat your companions.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> giving you 44 words(I guess)</p>Leadership is an innate quality as well as it can also be learned. If one is willing to be a good leader then he or she should really make up his or her mind and practice all the qualities of a good leader because everything costs hard work and dedication, without it nothing can be achieved. To be a successful leader, you have to be able to convince your followers, not just yourself or your superiors, that you are worthy of being followed. In my opinion, this can build confidence in their followers to have faith in you, in order to be able to lead. I strongly believe that good leaders are made rather, and not born. If you have the desire and willpower, you can become an effective leader. <br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Leadership is often thought of as the ability to influence others, but at its core, leadership is self-governance. It is the ability to lead oneself, to set goals, take initiative, and make decisions that positively impact one's life and the lives of others. Effective leaders are not just individuals who possess the skills to motivate and inspire others, but they are individuals who have mastered the art of self-leadership, self-awareness, and self-governance.</p><p></p><p>Self-governance is about taking responsibility for one's actions, making ethical decisions, and possessing the discipline to follow through on commitments. This is a key trait of effective leaders as they are accountable for their actions and decisions, and they set the tone for their team or organization by modeling good behavior. They are individuals who are guided by their values and principles, and they use these to make decisions that align with their goals and vision.</p><p></p><p>One of the key components of self-governance is self-awareness. Leaders who have a high level of self-awareness understand their strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. They are open to feedback and are willing to reflect on their actions and behaviors. They have a clear understanding of their values and beliefs, and they are able to align these with their goals and vision. Self-awareness allows leaders to recognize areas where they need to improve, and it also enables them to recognize and appreciate the strengths and abilities of others.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of self-governance is discipline. Effective leaders are disciplined individuals who possess the focus and determination to see a project or task through to completion. They are able to prioritize their time and resources, and they have the ability to say no to distractions or activities that do not align with their goals. Discipline allows leaders to stay focused on their priorities, and it also enables them to make the tough decisions when necessary.</p><p></p><p>In addition to self-awareness and discipline, effective leaders also possess strong decision-making skills. They are individuals who are able to make well-informed decisions based on data and evidence. They are able to weigh the pros and cons of different options and choose the best course of action. Leaders who have strong decision-making skills are also able to communicate their decisions clearly and effectively to their team or organization, which helps to build trust and confidence.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, leadership is self-governance. Effective leaders are individuals who possess the ability to lead themselves first. They are self-aware, disciplined, and possess strong decision-making skills. They are guided by their values and principles, and they use these to make decisions that align with their goals and vision. By mastering the art of self-leadership, individuals can develop the skills necessary to lead others and positively impact their lives and the lives of those around them. Leadership is not just about influencing others; it is about leading oneself first.</p><p></p><p>BRAINLIEST CUTIE</p><p></p><br />

There’s the leader who wants to closely monitor when and how you work and the leader whose main concern is whether or not the work gets done. There’s the leader who wants to make sure people feel heard and understood and the leader who prefers to exert authority. The different ways in which leaders interact with their teams are known as leadership styles, and while the most effective leaders combine various styles of leadership based on the need of the hour, most leaders exhibit a dominant style.</p><p></p><p>One of the earliest frameworks on leadership styles was proposed by a team of researchers led by psychologist Kurt Lewin in the 1930s. Lewin’s leadership styles fall into three categories: authoritative (or autocratic), participative (or democratic), and delegative (or laissez-faire). Since then, various other styles of leadership have been proposed, including but not limited to: transactional leadership, transformational leadership, servant leadership, and situational leadership.</p><p></p><p>In this article, we will take a deeper look at the democratic leadership style, its strengths and limitations, and ways in which it can be used effectively</p><p></p><p>PABRAINLIEST</p><p>#STAYSAFE</p><p></p><br />

                        The leader should be for the people, not for his/her own self. The servant leader shares power, puts the needs of their people first and helps them develop as highly as possible. My personal opinion of the ideology of Servant leadership is that this should be the base of all leaders. Whether they are a parent, a manager of a restaurant, a king, or a student president: They should lead in order to get an opportunity to righteously serve others. A leader who listens to its citizens greatly improve not only their relationship with their employees, but they also greatly affect their surroundings in a positive way. <br /><br />(Sorry maikli wala na akong maisip eh :&gt; kung nakatulong Pwede mo bang bigyan ng brainliest?)<br />
