The gray rabbit was the biggest of the three. Three rabbits lived in a small garden. The white rabbit was big. The brown rabbit was bigger than the white rabbit. The gray rabbit was the biggest of the three.         One day, they found three carrots on the ground. "I will eat the carrots", said the white rabbit in a loud voice. "I will eat the carrots all alone", said the brown rabbit in a louder voice. "I will eat it all myself", said the gray rabbit in a loudest voice.         A wise monkey lived in a tree nearby. He was wiser than the rabbits. In fact, he was the wisest monkey in the world. Why? When the monkey heard what the rabbits said, he hurriedly went to the garden. The three rabbits were busy fighting among themselves and they didn't see the monkey. The monkey snatched and ate up all the carrots.        At last stopped fighting. "Where were the carrots?" the three rabbits said. "It ran away because you made so much noise," said the monkey.         From then, the three rabbits learned to keep an eye and never argued on something. 1.Did you enjoy listening to the story? 2.Do you think that fighting each other just like what the three rabbits did is a good deed? 3.

Some people may argue that a college education is a waste of time and moncy. According to Vedder, “a goodly proportion of those attending four-year colleges full-time fail to graduate, even within six years," (Vedder, 78). By focusing on the percentage of people that fail to graduate, he overlooks the fact that 60% of college students are actually succeeding and graduating from college, which is more than those who are not. People are not better off skipping college. It is important to remember that a college degree opens many doors and provides graduates with many advantages in life.pataka lang2. Breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend can be easier said than done, but here are five steps that may belp the breaking up process. First, try to distance yourself by suddenly becoming busier than usual. Whenever she/he calls, tell him/her that you are busy, and you cannot talk. The next step is to calmly tell the other person how you are feeling. Then gently let him or her know that you do not want to be together anymore. Make sure to be sensitive of his or her feelings and answer any questions that he/she may have. For example, if the person starts to cry, use kind words to help comfort him or her. After everything is said and done, take some alone time for yourself because everyone has feelings to sort out after a breakup. Finally, go out with friends and meet new people. With these five steps, it will make the breaking up process smooth for both parties.3. Alcohol use and problem drinking in late adolescence vary by sociodemographic characteristics.

Studying abroad has two main benefits.  Firstly, people who study abroad can get a better job when they return to their home country.  This is because their qualifications and experience mean that they tend to get jobs that are higher paid, and they can also gain promotion quickly. Another advantage of studying abroad is the independence students can gain. For example, students have to cope with the challenges of living alone and meeting new people from different cultures.  As a consequence, they will become more confident in their life and in their relationships with others.  All in all, it is clear that studying abroad is a beneficial experience.</a>

                                            What is the impact of climate change in the Philippines?
Objectives of the Project
Scenes of flooding and storms show us just how much weather and climate can affect our lives. Climate affects nearly every aspect of our lives, from our food sources to our transport infrastructure, from what clothes we wear, to where we go on holiday. It has a huge effect on our livelihoods, our health, and our future. Climate is the long-term pattern of weather conditions in any particular place. We know that our climate is changing due to humans, and these changes are already having a big impact on our lives. It’s important that we understand how the climate is changing, so that we can prepare for the future. 
Studying the climate helps us predict how much rain the next winter might bring, or how far sea levels will rise due to warmer sea temperatures. We can also see which regions are most likely to be affected by extreme weather, or which wildlife species are threatened by climate change. Studying climate change will help us understand why global temperatures continue to rise, how the climate affects us, and how we can tackle this challenge before things get much worse. Knowledge regarding this phenomenon helps young people to understand and tackle the consequences of global warming, encourages them to change their behaviour and helps them to adapt to what is already a global emergency.
The climate crisis is not a looming threat, people are now living with the consequences of centuries of greenhouse gas emissions. A failure to act urgently now will mean a reverse in development gains for the poorest and most vulnerable people in society, an erosion of biodiversity, increasing difficulties in providing food and shelter, as well as the potential loss of entire countries due to the impacts of climate change. Preparing for climate change — also known as climate change adaptation — is about reducing the risk of climate change impacts to people, places and resources. We know that climate change is already occurring, and that additional warming is unavoidable. If we hope to limit the negative impacts of climate change, we must prepare by identifying vulnerabilities and by planning accordingly.
Studying climate change is essential to understanding its impact on our environment and knowing what steps we can take to help combat the issue. The magnitude of the Earth’s climate change significantly affects how our planets function. With proper understanding, we can understand how climate change affects us, why temperatures are rising so rapidly and how we can help. Increasing temperatures are causing a significant loss of sea ice affecting coastal ecosystems. Heat waves are happening much more frequently and are expected to keep growing. Without the help of the human race, climate change will cause more natural disasters and damage our ecosystems. As climate change continues, there is an increased chance of severe damage to the marine ecosystem, harming species living in the ocean and diminishing food supply throughout coastal regions. The impacts of climate change do not discriminate. It will begin wounding those with fewer resources first, but the effects will eventually harm everyone inhabiting the Earth. 
What will happen if we ignore climate change? Wildlife and their habitats will be destroyed, resulting in mass species extinction. Superstorms, droughts, and heat waves would become more frequent and severe, causing major health crises and illness. Agricultural output would plummet, potentially resulting in global food shortages and famine. Acting alone is insufficient. We must act immediately. Other significant advantages come from reducing short-lived climate pollutants. These include avoiding tens of millions of tonnes of annual staple crop losses, improving food security by avoiding tens of millions of tonnes of annual staple crop losses, protecting vital ecosystems and ecosystem services, lowering the risk of dangerous and irreversible climate tipping points.

Some people may argue that a college education is a waste of time and moncy. According to Vedder, “a goodly proportion of those attending four-year colleges full-time fail to graduate, even within six years," (Vedder, 78). By focusing on the percentage of people that fail to graduate, he overlooks the fact that 60% of college students are actually succeeding and graduating from college, which is more than those who are not. People are not better off skipping college. It is important to remember that a college degree opens many doors and provides graduates with many advantages in life.pataka lang2. Breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend can be easier said than done, but here are five steps that may belp the breaking up process. First, try to distance yourself by suddenly becoming busier than usual. Whenever she/he calls, tell him/her that you are busy, and you cannot talk. The next step is to calmly tell the other person how you are feeling. Then gently let him or her know that you do not want to be together anymore. Make sure to be sensitive of his or her feelings and answer any questions that he/she may have. For example, if the person starts to cry, use kind words to help comfort him or her. After everything is said and done, take some alone time for yourself because everyone has feelings to sort out after a breakup. Finally, go out with friends and meet new people. With these five steps, it will make the breaking up process smooth for both parties.3. Alcohol use and problem drinking in late adolescence vary by sociodemographic characteristics.

Studying abroad has two main benefits.  Firstly, people who study abroad can get a better job when they return to their home country.  This is because their qualifications and experience mean that they tend to get jobs that are higher paid, and they can also gain promotion quickly. Another advantage of studying abroad is the independence students can gain. For example, students have to cope with the challenges of living alone and meeting new people from different cultures.  As a consequence, they will become more confident in their life and in their relationships with others.  All in all, it is clear that studying abroad is a beneficial experience.</h2><br />

                            15. What is the impact of climate change in the Philippines?
Objectives of the Project
Scenes of flooding and storms show us just how much weather and climate can affect our lives. Climate affects nearly every aspect of our lives, from our food sources to our transport infrastructure, from what clothes we wear, to where we go on holiday. It has a huge effect on our livelihoods, our health, and our future. Climate is the long-term pattern of weather conditions in any particular place. We know that our climate is changing due to humans, and these changes are already having a big impact on our lives. It’s important that we understand how the climate is changing, so that we can prepare for the future. 
Studying the climate helps us predict how much rain the next winter might bring, or how far sea levels will rise due to warmer sea temperatures. We can also see which regions are most likely to be affected by extreme weather, or which wildlife species are threatened by climate change. Studying climate change will help us understand why global temperatures continue to rise, how the climate affects us, and how we can tackle this challenge before things get much worse. Knowledge regarding this phenomenon helps young people to understand and tackle the consequences of global warming, encourages them to change their behaviour and helps them to adapt to what is already a global emergency.
The climate crisis is not a looming threat, people are now living with the consequences of centuries of greenhouse gas emissions. A failure to act urgently now will mean a reverse in development gains for the poorest and most vulnerable people in society, an erosion of biodiversity, increasing difficulties in providing food and shelter, as well as the potential loss of entire countries due to the impacts of climate change. Preparing for climate change — also known as climate change adaptation — is about reducing the risk of climate change impacts to people, places and resources. We know that climate change is already occurring, and that additional warming is unavoidable. If we hope to limit the negative impacts of climate change, we must prepare by identifying vulnerabilities and by planning accordingly.
Studying climate change is essential to understanding its impact on our environment and knowing what steps we can take to help combat the issue. The magnitude of the Earth’s climate change significantly affects how our planets function. With proper understanding, we can understand how climate change affects us, why temperatures are rising so rapidly and how we can help. Increasing temperatures are causing a significant loss of sea ice affecting coastal ecosystems. Heat waves are happening much more frequently and are expected to keep growing. Without the help of the human race, climate change will cause more natural disasters and damage our ecosystems. As climate change continues, there is an increased chance of severe damage to the marine ecosystem, harming species living in the ocean and diminishing food supply throughout coastal regions. The impacts of climate change do not discriminate. It will begin wounding those with fewer resources first, but the effects will eventually harm everyone inhabiting the Earth. 
What will happen if we ignore climate change? Wildlife and their habitats will be destroyed, resulting in mass species extinction. Superstorms, droughts, and heat waves would become more frequent and severe, causing major health crises and illness. Agricultural output would plummet, potentially resulting in global food shortages and famine. Acting alone is insufficient. We must act immediately. Other significant advantages come from reducing short-lived climate pollutants. These include avoiding tens of millions of tonnes of annual staple crop losses, improving food security by avoiding tens of millions of tonnes of annual staple crop losses, protecting vital ecosystems and ecosystem services, lowering the risk of dangerous and irreversible climate tipping points.
