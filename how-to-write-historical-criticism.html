Thus identity is complicated and rich, involving much more than gender alone.Feminist Criticism-Feminist criticism is concerned with "the ways in which literature (and other cultural productions) reinforce or undermine the economic, political, social, and psychological oppression of women" Historical-of, relating to, or having the character of history historical data. b : based on history historical novels. c : used in the past and reproduced in historical presentations.Reader Response Criticism-Reader-response criticism is a school of literary theory that focuses on the reader (or “audience”) and their experience of a literary work, in contrast to other schools and theories that focus attention primarily on the author or the content and form of the work.Structuralism-Structuralism is a mode of knowledge of nature and human life that is interested in relationships rather than individual objects or, alternatively, where objects are defined by the set of relationships of which they are part and not by the qualities possessed by them taken in isolation.Sociological-Sociology is a social science that focuses on society, human social behaviour, patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and aspects of culture associated with everyday life. <br />

What could be good objects or topics for historical research? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Historical research enables you to explore and explain the meanings, phases and characteristics of a phenomenon or process at a particular point of time in the past. We differentiate historical research as a research strategy from the research of history, which refers to research in the discipline of history.</p><p> </p><p>2. Choose a general topic that interests you. You should start fairly broad, like "Civil War Battles" or "Women during the 19th Century." Be prepared to narrow that topic down. Ultimately your paper will have a very narrow focus, but identifying an era or general topic that interests you is a good place to start.</p><p></p><p>3. What is historical research? Historical research relies on a wide variety of sources, both primary &amp; secondary including unpublished material. Found in public records &amp; legal documents, minutes of meetings, corporate records, recordings, letters, diaries, journals, drawings.</p><p></p><p>4. </p><p></p><p>5. Why is external criticism important? External criticism is when historians check the validity of a source to verify whether or not it's authentic. This process is important regarding analyzing data, because we have to question whether or not we can trust the data and use it as a reference point.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>As a historical novel, The Three Musketeers organizes its story around some of the major characters and events of 17th-century French history. Cardinal Richelieu, Anne of Austria, and other important characters really lived and acted at least roughly the way they do in the novel. The Three Musketeers is inspired by a 17th-century work entitled Memoires de d'Artagnan by Gatien de Cortilz de Sandras, which Dumas and Maquet stumbled across in their research. At the time, Dumas did not believe that the Cortilz novel was historical but thought he was simply plagiarizing and developing a previous writer's work. But Dumas claimed in his original introduction to The Three Musketeers that he thought the work was historical, not wanting to seem plagiaristic himself.</p><p></p><br />
