THIS ACT Senate bill 438 known as Rizal Bill which was first authored by Senator Claro M. Recto- requiring the inclusion in the curricular of all private and public schools, colleges and universities the life, works and writings - is considered as one of the most of Jose Rizal particularly his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo controversial bills in the Philippines. Normally, before the bill was approved and implemented in all schools and was signed into a law known as Republic Act 1425, it had been brought to the Upper and Lower House of the Congress for deliberations. But what made it controversial is that the bill was not just fiercely opposed by people from Legislative Arm but also by the Catholic Church due to the inclusion of compulsory reading of Rizal's novels in which according to them, catholic dogmas are humiliated. Senator Recto brought the bill to the Senate and Senator Jose B. Laurel Sr. who was then the Chairman of the Committee on Education sponsored the bill that consequently led to exchange of arguments from the Congress. The bill was headedly opposed by three senators namely Senator Francisco Rodrigo who was a former Catholic Action President, Senator Mariano Cuenco and Senator Decoroso Rosales who was the brother of Julio Rosales, an archbishop. Other oppositors were from Lower House namely Congressmen Ramon Durano, Marciano Lim, Jose Nuguid, Manuel Soza, Godofredo Ramos, Miguel Cuenco, Lucas Paredes, Congressmen Carmen Consing and Tecia San Andres Ziga. The Catholic Church was indirectly included in the debates and played a major role for the intervention of signing of the bill into a law. Allied with the church in battle against Rizal Bill were the Holy Name Society of the Philippines, Catholic Action of the Philippines, Legion of Mary, Knights of Columbus and Daughters of Isabela.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Ang pag-aaral ng “Noli Me Tangere” na sinulat ni Jose Rizal ay isa sa mapanghamong aralin para sa akin. Nasabi ko ito dahil malalim at maraming kahulugan ang mga pangyayari at pati na din ang mga tauhan nito. Ako ay talagang napapaisip mabuti sa bawat kabanata na binabasa ko. Madalas ay nahihirapan akong isipin ang senaryo ng mga pangyayari dahil ang tagpuan ng nobela ay ibang-iba sa itsura ng Maynila ngayon. Mabuti na lamang at dahil sa “Lakbay-Aral”, nakita kong marami pa palang lugar sa Maynila ang inalagaang mabuti upang ang itsura nito ay hindi mabago sa orihinal na pagkakatayo nito.</p><p>Ang unang lugar na nakapukaw ng aking atensyon ay nang magpunta kami sa Fort Santiago. Nalaman ko na ito ay naging kulungan ng maraming Pilipino noong panahon ng Kastila, at isa na dito si Jose Rizal. Naisip ko kung gaano kaya karaming Pilipino ang inakusahan ng krimen na hindi naman nila totoong ginawa tulad ni Rizal. Ang Fort Santiago ay isa sa patunay kung paano pinahirapan at inabuso ng mga Kastila ang maraming Pilipino. Sinasabing hindi naging makatao ang pagtrato ng mga Kastila sa mga Pilipinong bilanggo dito. Naalala ko tuloy ang Kabanata 4 at 5 ng Noli Me Tangere kung saan sa Kabanata 4 ay ikinuwento ni Tenyente Guevarra kay Ibarra kung paano at bakit nakulong si Don Rafael Ibarra noong panahong wala siya at pagkalipas ng panahon ay namatay na din ito sa kulungan. Sa Kabanata 5 naman ay pinakita na naiisip ni Ibarra ang kanyang ama habang ito ay“nakakulong sa marumi at nakadidiring” kulungan. Naisip ko na ang kulungan ni Don Rafael ay kamukha din siguro ng Fort Santiago at ang pagtrato sa kanya doon ay hindi din makatao kung kaya siya ay namatay sa kulungan dahil sa pagkakasakit doon.</p><p></p><br />

THIS ACT Senate bill 438 known as Rizal Bill which was first authored by Senator Claro M. Recto- requiring the inclusion in the curricular of all private and public schools, colleges and universities the life, works and writings - is considered as one of the most of Jose Rizal particularly his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo controversial bills in the Philippines. Normally, before the bill was approved and implemented in all schools and was signed into a law known as Republic Act 1425, it had been brought to the Upper and Lower House of the Congress for deliberations. But what made it controversial is that the bill was not just fiercely opposed by people from Legislative Arm but also by the Catholic Church due to the inclusion of compulsory reading of Rizal's novels in which according to them, catholic dogmas are humiliated. Senator Recto brought the bill to the Senate and Senator Jose B. Laurel Sr. who was then the Chairman of the Committee on Education sponsored the bill that consequently led to exchange of arguments from the Congress. The bill was headedly opposed by three senators namely Senator Francisco Rodrigo who was a former Catholic Action President, Senator Mariano Cuenco and Senator Decoroso Rosales who was the brother of Julio Rosales, an archbishop. Other oppositors were from Lower House namely Congressmen Ramon Durano, Marciano Lim, Jose Nuguid, Manuel Soza, Godofredo Ramos, Miguel Cuenco, Lucas Paredes, Congressmen Carmen Consing and Tecia San Andres Ziga. The Catholic Church was indirectly included in the debates and played a major role for the intervention of signing of the bill into a law. Allied with the church in battle against Rizal Bill were the Holy Name Society of the Philippines, Catholic Action of the Philippines, Legion of Mary, Knights of Columbus and Daughters of Isabela.
