                                            Assessment Directions: Read the text comprehensively. Based from the text, make an essay of exposition focusing on statement of position only using at least five sentences. Write your answer in your English notebook. COVID -19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. It is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally. It is caused by a virus, not by bacteria. The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces. Among the positive cases so far, 1,803 (or 31%) are senior citizens, or at least 60 years old. The elderly are at higher risk for severe illness due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Among the 387 deaths as of April 17, a total of 260 are 60 years old and above, 69 are in their 50s, 36 are in their 40s, 13 in their 30s, and 9 are below 30, including the youngest death at less than 1-year old. The best way to prevent the virus from spreading is by avoiding close contact with people with COVID-19 and washing the hands regularly. When soap is not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching the face before washing the hands. Keep surrounding surfaces as clean as possible and avoid sharing household items. For those with mild symptoms, call a doctor over the phone for medical advice. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak. (source Department of Health, June 23, 2020).​</a>

Based from the text, make an essay of exposition focusing on statement of position only using at least five sentences. COVID -19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. It is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally. It is caused by a virus, not by bacteria. The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces. Among the positive cases so far, 1,803 (or 31%) are senior citizens, or at least 60 years old. The elderlies are at higher risk for severe illness due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Among the 387 deaths as of April 17, a total of 260 are 60 years old and above, 69 are in their 50s, 36 are in their 40s, 13 in their 30s, and 9 are below 30, including the youngest death at less than 1-year old. The best way to prevent the virus from spreading is by avoiding close contact with people with COVID 19 and washing the hands regularly. When soap is not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching the face before washing the hands. Keep surrounding surfaces as clean as possible and avoid sharing household items. For those with mild symptoms, call a doctor over the phone for medical advice. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak. (source Department of Health, June 23, 2020)​</a>

To stop the spread of COVID-19, along with other COVID appropriate behaviours, the practice of handwashing at regular intervals is a must, after coughing or sneezing, when caring for the sick, after using the toilet, before eating, while preparing food and after handling animals or animal waste. Handwashing after touching common surfaces such as doorknobs or handles, or after one comes back home from visiting a public place will keep ourselves and others around us safe</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it's help</p><p>thanks  me later</p><br />

PERFORMANCE TASKDirection: (ESSAY)Read and understand the situation and write your answer in the space providedbelowSituation:As we experienced the global pandemic brought by COVID 19 virus that affectsour everyday life of living. The Department of Health sets the standard protocol tobe followed like wearing of facemasks, face shields, social distancing, washing ofhands, and using disinfectants especially the alcohol to sanitize our hands and othersurfaces that might be infected with the virus. Why do health professionals highlyrecommend everyone to use alcohol as disinfectant to fight COVID 19 virus?What percent of alcohol is the best one to use 70% or 40°? Why?Answer​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread across the globe, it's of the utmost importance to keep ourselves and those around us healthy right now. That's why we've stocked up on hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, and other sanitizing products to prevent the spread of COVID-19. But as the virus continues to spread as the months go by, we're being reminded that not all the products on the market are equally effective. </p><p>One common misconception is that the higher the percentage of alcohol you're using for disinfecting, the greater the chances are that you're actually clearing your skin and surfaces of germs. Isopropyl alcohol 70 percent, or isopropyl alcohol 99 percent diluted to 70 percent with purified water, kills organisms by denaturing their proteins. A 70 percent isopropyl alcohol solution dissolves their lipids and is effective against most bacteria and fungi and many viruses.</p><p>In terms of disinfecting, higher concentrations of alcohol are less effective at killing bacteria. Certain bugs, such as bacteria, are better eliminated with the use of a less concentrated isopropanol, because higher concentrations cause an external injury that forms a protective wall and shields these organisms. Sure, it seems counterintuitive, but in some cases, including in terms of preventing the spread of COVID-19, 99 percent isopropanol is too powerful of an alcohol solution. Simply put, it breaks down the outside of the cell before it can penetrate the germ in question. On the other hand, 70 percent alcohol is the perfect concoction of alcohol and water to cross a cell membrane, thereby attacking the entire cell and killing the bacteria.</p><br />

COVID -19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. It is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally. It is caused by a virus, not by bacteria. The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces. Among the positive cases so far, 1,803 (or 31%) are senior citizens, or at least 60 years old. The elderly are at higher risk for severe illness due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Among the 387 deaths as of April 17, a total of 260 are 60 years old and above, 69 are in their 50s, 36 are in their 40s, 13 in their 30s, and 9 are below 30, including the youngest death at less than 1-year old. The best way to prevent the virus from spreading is by avoiding close contact with people with COVID-19 and washing the hands regularly. When soap is not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching the face before washing the hands. Keep surrounding surfaces as clean as possible and avoid sharing household items. For those with mild symptoms, call a doctor over the phone for medical advice. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak. (source Department of Health, June 23, 2020).​</h2><br />

COVID -19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. It is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally. It is caused by a virus, not by bacteria. The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces. Among the positive cases so far, 1,803 (or 31%) are senior citizens, or at least 60 years old. The elderlies are at higher risk for severe illness due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Among the 387 deaths as of April 17, a total of 260 are 60 years old and above, 69 are in their 50s, 36 are in their 40s, 13 in their 30s, and 9 are below 30, including the youngest death at less than 1-year old. The best way to prevent the virus from spreading is by avoiding close contact with people with COVID 19 and washing the hands regularly. When soap is not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching the face before washing the hands. Keep surrounding surfaces as clean as possible and avoid sharing household items. For those with mild symptoms, call a doctor over the phone for medical advice. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak. (source Department of Health, June 23, 2020)​</h2><br />
