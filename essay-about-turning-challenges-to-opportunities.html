                                            Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</a>

                        Challenges
are very useful when it is given to an open-minded person.

Challenges
can only cause two effects to a person. It can either make or break you.

A positive
person takes challenges in a good way, that’s the time when a challenge is
making a person. It can teach you lessons, can give you knowledge that makes
you a better person.

Whereas, a person with a negative mind
takes challenges just like how they mind are, negatively. They treat challenges
as a liability and the more they think of it as that, the more they’re becoming
true. <br />

                        Challenges are opportunities. For the pessimistic people, the statement may sound weird but for the optimistic ones, the statement is a reality. Challenges are part of our daily lives. We struggle the moment we woke up, when we rode the jeepneys to school or work. Every single action is a struggle in our part but only our attitude towards this struggle can make the difference. Let us not forget that our attitude matters. If we consider this struggle as opportunities then these will become opportunities because not all bad things are bad sometimes it is the path towards attaining the best. <strong>What comes first in our minds is that challenges are problems and nothing else. Battling them is a brilliant idea. The reality regarding challenges is they're not actually a problem nor difficulties but they are sometimes opportunities instead. Challenges were not meant to destroy us or to let us feel weak but it provides us with strengths and lessons in which we can use for the rest of our lives. They're simply blessings in disguise.</strong><br />

                            5. Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time
Essay Topic: Learning at Home during Lockdown: My
Parents and My Teachers
is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Covid-19 Shocked the entire world due to its sudden appearance, it caused chaos and panic among-st nations and governments. 2 years ago non of us imagined that we would be stuck in our homes in lock down yet here we are. It did massive economy damages in all countries and caused major problems and inconvenience to people. However and shined a light on a different point of view. It made us realize the the world is finite, our resources are not limitless and that we should learn and educate ourselves to respect those who work day and night to provide food and water for our nations. We should also thank those who constantly put their selves into danger and sacrifice their lives to find a cure to the current pandemic especially the doctors and front liners. Another thing the lock down taught us is that everything is temporary, Nothing stays the same for long  but when it changes doesn't mean it's gone. The lives that were lost during the pandemic were not in vain, and their legacy and memory will live on. Yes death is inevitable but we shouldn't dwell on what's to come but instead live in the moment and create memories as we go, cherish our loved ones because we will never what the future holds.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps &lt;3</p><br />

We either take it or leave it. </p><p>In the end, It's all about risk taking and not regretting your decision whether you took up to the challenge or let it pass through, it's all up to you but always remember 'If opportunities doesn't knock, build a door'.</p><br />

                        Challenges may seem like a burden to everyone but come to think of it, challenges are actually test to measure a person's endurance towards pain and hardship. One must not think that challenges are punishments instead they are hurdles that need to be overcome in order to reach the peak of success. Challenges are not always in favor of our side but at the end of the day you will realize that the challenges you went through are just trainings and actually opportunities where you can actually learn a lot.<br />

                        The struggle of facing a lot of challenges is the mindset that we are being punished and that we do not deserve the good life that others have. That should not be the case because challenges can be opportunities. You can always make a three hundred sixty degrees turn and make your challenges into something beneficial, something worth living and something that is very opposite to a miserable challenge that you conceived. Challenges may hurt and break your soft heart but it is the only way have a new stronger heart.<br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Persuasive essay about turning your challenges into opportunities:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>To write a persuasive essay, first, you must know the definition of persuasive. Persuasive means being “convincing”. Thus it means you must convince your readers, convince them that they can turn their challenges into opportunities.</p><br /><br /><p>Here’s a very short <strong>example of persuasive essay about turning challenges to opportunities:</strong></p><br /><br /><p>“I was challenged by a professor before in a marketing class. He said: How can you sell your product - which is ice cream, by the way - in Baguio… during freezing point in December?” Then I froze. That was a challenge, right? How can you sell a freezing product during a freezing season?! I had to answer that question before I got a failing mark for the recitation. My scholarship was at risk.</p><br /><br /><p>After a minute or two of thinking… and freezing, I had finally answered it and got a perfect score. My scholarship was saved. Actually, I learned from my own answer. I was also surprised by it. And even these days, I still apply what I’ve learned from my own adrenaline rush and use that technique in my marketing strategies. That’s my <strong>“turning challenges into opportunities example”.</strong> Challenges must not break us, they must make us. We learn from obstacles and it makes us smarter, braver, and better. It must be an opportunity to grow and be wiser.  </p><br /><p>So don’t be afraid of these challenges. Face them and accept your fate. The metamorphosis! You will be a much better version of yourself when you face and solve these challenges. It’s scary. Yes, it is. But if you will always allow yourself to have a pair of frozen feet, what will be your progress? Let the metamorphosis turn you into a butterfly. Still curious about my answer to my prof? I said… “Well, I’ll build a warm coziest place in the city with such magnificent fireplace for them to enjoy the ambiance and taste my yummy ice creams.” Now, I am going to open an ice cream house at Baguio.”</p><br /><br /><p>****</p><p>That’s a <strong>challenges and opportunities essay</strong> and can be a <strong>persuasive speech about challenges.</strong></p><p>****</p><p><strong>What questions about turning challenges into opportunities do you still have in mind?</strong> Hope the links below help you:</p><br /><p><strong>1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is often our most challenging moments in life that offer us the greatest opportunities to grow and expand. Take a real honest look at any challenges you have faced in the past. Are you better or worse off for having faced those challenges? Start to view all challenges as delayed opportunities waiting to be exploited. Strive to see any roadblocks that you may encounter, on your way to living your potential as merely “FUTURE OPPORTUNITY GENERATORS”. When you train yourself to do this, you will completely change your thought patterns around challenges. This small shift in your thinking, will allow you to turn any challenges (big or small) into new opportunities far sooner. While you don't want to ignore reality, you can learn to deal positively with negative people and events. There is no need to focus on the negative when a shift in your attitude can bring you learning and growth. This shift happens when you see any challenges or hardships as merely an opportunity to gain new experiences and knowledge. Thank the challenging people that cross your path, for teaching you about yourself and for giving you the opportunity to learn the benefits of a positive mindset. These CHALLENGING PEOPLE, that are traditionally viewed so negatively offer an opportunity for SPIRITUAL AND PERSONAL GROWTH and teach you invaluable lessons that will help you to explore and utilize your brilliance.</p><p></p><p>If challenges and obstacles were the deciding factor in how everyone’s lives turned out then no one would attain success. The only difference between successful people and those that settle for mediocrity is that the former see challenges as things to overcome on their way to success and the latter see them as reasons not to even try.</p><p>Everything in life is a choice; you get to choose the manner in which you face any challenges. You can choose to face any challenges that come your way from a perspective of helplessness or you can choose to react to these same challenges, from a standpoint of personal power. When you practice the latter you are consciously optimistic and all challenges will be temporary and easily solved. Your future is never dependant on what happens to you, but rather how you respond to what happens to you. Learn to look for the opportunity in every challenge you face. Remain positive in the face of adversity and allow challenges to become the catalyst that sparks new opportunities in your life. Can we ever expect to live life free of challenges? YES! Seeing anything as a challenge is a choice. Change the way you view any "Challenge" and it can then become a DELAYED OPPORTUNITY, waiting for you to exploit.</p><p></p><p>Difficulties and challenges are inevitable throughout your life, choosing a defeatist attitude and allowing yourself to be beaten is always optional. The only difference between “PERCIEVED FAILURE” and a “HIDDEN OPPORTUNITY” is your belief about and your attitude toward challenges, obstacles and “FAILURE”. When any problem forms a shadow over your life, do not waste energy trying to make it disappear by attempting to stamp it out or resisting it in any way. Firstly just alter the way you view any problem and see it simply as a challenge, which as you know, can be easily overcome, by shining the light of your determined energy on it. Leave the mistakes and absurdities from yesterday behind and allow them to only serve as lessons for today. Yesterday is simply the foundation of knowledge upon which you should build today, never a reason to encumber today. Fill today with your hopes and dreams and don’t waste a moment on yesterday, it is gone forever. Anything outstanding that has ever been achieved started out as only a dream, an idea in someone’s head. You can also create wonders with your dreams and hopes, if you also, nourish and protect them and accept that you will need to nurse them through challenges, until you get to make them shine as they become your new reality. Rise to the challenge and realize that you have a unique capacity to shape your life, search around and especially within yourself for the kind of growth that will shape and fulfill you. This challenge may seem impossible, but the effort will most certainly be worthwhile. Remember even the highest mountain can be surmounted by building winding pathways.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>hello, mahaba haba lang po pero sana ay makatulong.^^</p><p></p><br />
