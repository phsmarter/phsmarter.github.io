                                            Activity 5.1. AUTOBIOGRAPHY Autobiography of a StudentMy name is Elizabeth Austen. I was born on May 2, 2002 in Marseille, France. I was raised as a child of two cultures: American and French. Although my parents were born in the USA, they left for Marseille after their wedding because of career goals. My father is a translator, and my mother is an art consultant, so the atmosphere of our house was creative and artistic.It was difficult for me to make friends with French peers. That’s why I have always communicated with adults who were my parents’ friends or colleagues. Since childhood, I have had a thirst for knowledge and new discoveries, and elder friends were happy to share their memories and life experiences with a little, curious girl.I have a talent for learning languages and studying art. That’s not surprising taking into account my environment. When I was a teenager, I dreamed of becoming a writer. I still store my notebooks as a memory about my first drafts.Later on, I understood that my heart belongs to art. I spent much time in my mother’s office listening to her impromptu lectures about famous paintings. Her lessons along with her stories about the USA have inspired me to go to the United States and attend the California College of the Arts to get a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art History.My main belief in life is that everything should be in harmony. People have to keep balance in all spheres of life: society, family, work, friendship, and others. Studying art is my personal way to keep balance. I’m driven by my passion to visit all cities with a rich artistic history: Venice, Rome, London, San-Francisco, Tokyo, and so many others. These journeys will not only improve my professional skills but also will help to learn more about myself and people.I believe that studying at the California College of the Arts will allow me to become a real professional with a mature art taste and extensive knowledge of art history. In the future, I will follow my mother’s footsteps in order to help people discover the beautiful world of art. If my career as an art consultant isn’t successful, I will dedicate my life to teaching future generations of students and cultivating their love of fine arts.1. Who are the characters?2.

The year 2020 was one of my most awaited years because I had a lot of plans for this year and this decade, My friends and I had planned to visit several cities before the year ended. I had also planned to visit several relatives and to work more this year with the kids from church. However, this has turned out to be a historical year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. When the virus started in China, no one would have imagined that it would cross borders and would hit the world like it has today. Worse of all , I would never have imagined that I would see the most deaths from a virus in such a short time. Though everything seems tough at this moment, I have also witnessed some positives, and one of them is that the pandemic has forced me to spend time with my family and appreciate life and other basics such as food and shelter, which I always took for granted. My resilience level has also gone high because I have become tough from the situations around me. For example, I can now cope with being indoors the whole day. I also find myself being even more creative with my family.

                            2. Activity 5.1. AUTOBIOGRAPHY Autobiography of a StudentMy name is Elizabeth Austen. I was born on May 2, 2002 in Marseille, France. I was raised as a child of two cultures: American and French. Although my parents were born in the USA, they left for Marseille after their wedding because of career goals. My father is a translator, and my mother is an art consultant, so the atmosphere of our house was creative and artistic.It was difficult for me to make friends with French peers. That’s why I have always communicated with adults who were my parents’ friends or colleagues. Since childhood, I have had a thirst for knowledge and new discoveries, and elder friends were happy to share their memories and life experiences with a little, curious girl.I have a talent for learning languages and studying art. That’s not surprising taking into account my environment. When I was a teenager, I dreamed of becoming a writer. I still store my notebooks as a memory about my first drafts.Later on, I understood that my heart belongs to art. I spent much time in my mother’s office listening to her impromptu lectures about famous paintings. Her lessons along with her stories about the USA have inspired me to go to the United States and attend the California College of the Arts to get a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art History.My main belief in life is that everything should be in harmony. People have to keep balance in all spheres of life: society, family, work, friendship, and others. Studying art is my personal way to keep balance. I’m driven by my passion to visit all cities with a rich artistic history: Venice, Rome, London, San-Francisco, Tokyo, and so many others. These journeys will not only improve my professional skills but also will help to learn more about myself and people.I believe that studying at the California College of the Arts will allow me to become a real professional with a mature art taste and extensive knowledge of art history. In the future, I will follow my mother’s footsteps in order to help people discover the beautiful world of art. If my career as an art consultant isn’t successful, I will dedicate my life to teaching future generations of students and cultivating their love of fine arts.1. Who are the characters?2.

The year 2020 was one of my most awaited years because I had a lot of plans for this year and this decade, My friends and I had planned to visit several cities before the year ended. I had also planned to visit several relatives and to work more this year with the kids from church. However, this has turned out to be a historical year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. When the virus started in China, no one would have imagined that it would cross borders and would hit the world like it has today. Worse of all , I would never have imagined that I would see the most deaths from a virus in such a short time. Though everything seems tough at this moment, I have also witnessed some positives, and one of them is that the pandemic has forced me to spend time with my family and appreciate life and other basics such as food and shelter, which I always took for granted. My resilience level has also gone high because I have become tough from the situations around me. For example, I can now cope with being indoors the whole day. I also find myself being even more creative with my family.
