 on the space provided after each paragraph. 1. “A dog is man’s best friend,” is a very common saying that contains some truth. Butdogs may not be the only animal whose companionship and friendship people enjoy. That is because there are many people who consider a cat their best friend. Personally, I think cats make excellent house pets as they are good companions. They are sweet and refined members of the household. They are soft and easy tocuddle since they are not heavy. ________________________________________2. We shouldn’t have homework on weekends. It takes away family time. You have todo your homework instead of playing with the family. You can’t go outside to play, soyou can get fat. We should also do it at school because we can’t ask the teacherquestions when we do it at home. It is hard to concentrate when you could be outsideplaying with friends. I hope you agree with me. ______________________________3. Most adults and children enjoy watching television. It is the most common pastime ofmany people. It does not cost much. It is appealing and within the reach of even thepoor people. In this manner, TV has become an important part of the mass mediaaround the world. Unfortunately, this resource is not used in a way that people couldget the best possible benefits from it. Hence, I would like to convince the readersthat they should not watch too much television. They must limit their time watching itbecause many TV programs do not have educational content. It makes peoplewaste time that could be used in more advantageous and profitable activities. Itnegatively affects people’s mental development. ______________________________________________4. In order to safely and efficiently operate a solid heating system, there are certainprecautions to consider. The chimney connectors and joints and the chimney fluemust be cleaned regularly. The wood supply must be kept at least five feet from thestove. _________________________________________ 5. Adolescence is often considered as one of the most challenging, the roughest, moststormy and most difficult phase of life for both children and their parents. During thisphase from childhood to adulthood, teenagers often look for the possibility of beingable to identify themselves as they start to search for their spot in this world. _________________________________________​</a>

 on the space provided after each paragraph. 1. “A dog is man’s best friend,” is a very common saying that contains some truth. Butdogs may not be the only animal whose companionship and friendship people enjoy. That is because there are many people who consider a cat their best friend. Personally, I think cats make excellent house pets as they are good companions. They are sweet and refined members of the household. They are soft and easy tocuddle since they are not heavy. ________________________________________2. We shouldn’t have homework on weekends. It takes away family time. You have todo your homework instead of playing with the family. You can’t go outside to play, soyou can get fat. We should also do it at school because we can’t ask the teacherquestions when we do it at home. It is hard to concentrate when you could be outsideplaying with friends. I hope you agree with me. ______________________________3. Most adults and children enjoy watching television. It is the most common pastime ofmany people. It does not cost much. It is appealing and within the reach of even thepoor people. In this manner, TV has become an important part of the mass mediaaround the world. Unfortunately, this resource is not used in a way that people couldget the best possible benefits from it. Hence, I would like to convince the readersthat they should not watch too much television. They must limit their time watching itbecause many TV programs do not have educational content. It makes peoplewaste time that could be used in more advantageous and profitable activities. Itnegatively affects people’s mental development. ______________________________________________4. In order to safely and efficiently operate a solid heating system, there are certainprecautions to consider. The chimney connectors and joints and the chimney fluemust be cleaned regularly. The wood supply must be kept at least five feet from thestove. _________________________________________ 5. Adolescence is often considered as one of the most challenging, the roughest, moststormy and most difficult phase of life for both children and their parents. During thisphase from childhood to adulthood, teenagers often look for the possibility of beingable to identify themselves as they start to search for their spot in this world. _________________________________________​</h2><br />

This phenomenon results in the hindrance of most individuals’ communication skills. Social media is inhibiting our young population’s ability to communicate.A large factor of social media that cannot be ignored is cyberbullying. The many forms of social media that surround us today open the door for vicious attacks on individuals without direct contact. Because young people can now antagonize others without facing them in person, the verbal bullying in our society has increased drastically, all while the attacker sits behind a phone or laptop, never facing consequences.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            16. Sample Introduction #1: This essay discusses the topic of donating blood. When you woke up this morning, did you think today would be the day you save a life? In fact, it's quite easy to save a life and it only takes a little bit of your time. You don't even need to be a paramedic or firefighter. All you have to do is set aside approximately one hour to donate blood. This essay will explore how to donate blood, whom it benefits, and how often you can contribute to these life-saving measures. Sample Conclusion #1: This concludes the essay example above on the topic of donating blood. Note how it emphasizes the simplicity of the process. The process of donating blood is decidedly simple. Many folks carry out the process while reading a chapter from a new book or watching an episode of their favorite TV show. Indeed, the infinitesimal amount of time it takes to donate blood can transfer into a lifetime of happiness for the recipient. Remember to bring juice or something sugary to keep your glucose levels high at the end of the procedure. Then, hold your head up high, knowing there's a life out there that's about to be saved by you. Questions: 1. How do you find the sample introduction? 2. How about the conclusion?please help me​</h2><br />
