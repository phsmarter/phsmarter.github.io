                                            As happens in most families, the oldest children are put in charge of theyoungest. While Frank acts as the self-assumed leader of the family, thechildren recognize that their mother Lillian, who also works professionallyas a psychologist, is the driving force behind the family. Mother neverthreatened, never shouted or became excited, never spanked a single oneof her children or anyone else. As the children grow, they are taught tobehave differently from children in smaller households. For example, theyall have to come running when the father whistles. While this might seemautocratic, Frank made it a game and to place them quietly upon assembly.Schooling is also emphasized, both in the home and in educationalinstitutions. Frank is very creative in ways he can help his children learnabout the world from a very young age. He is always pushing the childrento advance academically, staying ahead of their peers Frank does this bysurrounding the children with educational games and by creating learningopportunities for them. He is also very involved in their school life, evengoing in to sit in on dasses unexpectedly.1. What does the story tells you?2. Reflect on how the Gilbreth family runs their household.​</a>

The story goes that a kingdom just lost their king in ill health and his people were left without a leader. There were two datus from two warring tribes who are legitimate successors. They were not only rivals to the throne but rivals to the love of a princess named Liglioa who was also a ward to the kingdom's priestess and for a mystic huge pearl which would give wealth to anyone who possesses it, but is mysteriously un-gathered from the bottom of the sea. These two rivals had been fighting for a long time now that the priestess finally consulted the ancestors and the oracle gave her what ought to be done to attain peace and unity for the whole kingdom, which she in turn instructed to the princess. Liglioa then told the two waring datus that whoever wins in the last battle shall win her hand in marriage and the pearl in the bottom of the ocean. The two datus and their tribes prepared long and hard for the upcoming sea battle and by night, bodies and swords were clashing each other. And before daybreak, something strange can be noticed on the dead warriors' bodies and their upturned bancas. They were immobile; and soon grass began to grow on them and became a hundred small islands. The priestess then told Liglioa what happened and the truth about the huge pearl. The real pearl was Liglioa all along, sent to the people by the gods, as they foresaw that the kingdom would be without a ruler when the former king dies. The huge pearl at the bottom of the ocean was a mere illusion made to test the character of that rightful ruler. Fishermen of today still swear that a bit farther of where the islands are now, one can see the mysterious huge pearl mystically gleaming under the clear waters of the sea, beckoning, then disappearing just as swiftly as it came​</a>

                                            Act with Kindness Story.Once, an ill-mannered man named Shah was slandering Karim, a Muslim prayer leader. After a while, Shah noticed that Karim was not responding to him at all. So he said, "I'm talking to you!" Karim said in response, "And I am ignoring you."Another Muslim prayer leader came. When Shah saw him, he also started shouting and used foul languages towards the second prayer leader. Many of their Muslim brothers heard about this and wanted to punish Shah for what he did and said. But the two Muslim leaders told them to leave him alone.Karim then turned to Shah and greeted him with "Salaam". He asked Shahif he would like to come to his house for food and shelter as he had just come froma long trip.Shah was so surprised for the gesture that he had just received. He thought, "How can this man offer me food and shelter when I had just cursed at his face it cannot be true. He is just trying to shove me away by showing me pretenses," he muttered. The second prayer leader also came to Shah and offered him his drink.Shah soon came to his senses and felt very ashamed of how he had acted and spoken. He asked for their forgiveness and acknowledged the kindness they had given him. After that day, whenever Shah would hear anyone saying anything against the two Muslim prayer leaders, he would gladly correct it.He reciprocated their kindness by doing the same act of goodness to his other Muslim brothers in the community. And, whenever somebody would abuse him and use foul languages at his face, he would say, "I am not hearing you."Shah learned to never get angry at someone when he or she is angry. Neverpunish someone who has hurt you. Instead, act with kindness in your heart.Questions:1.What did karim do when shah slandering him?2. How did karim reciprocate the bad gesture of shah towards him?3. How did shah became a changed man ?4. From then on, how did shah treat those who would abuse and say foul languages to his face ?5. What is the moral lesson of the story?good answer - brainliest nonsense Answer - report​</a>

                                            "The Future Gender Equality" Robert Grant The future Gender equality Recruiters are key to gender solution, says Robert Grant Recruiters know about hiring, but they could- and arguably should be more influential to businesses around issues of gender equality. But this comes with responsibility and the need for any chosen recruiter to prioritise diversity as a business objective. Monitoring diversity means recruiters can address discrepancies. For example, equally qualified and sometimes more qualified women are not equally hired. Women's tenure is higher in banks than for men and fewer women are employed in the digital industry. To stay competitive, businesses must encourage hiring managers to understand the implications of these trends and should work in partnership with recruiters. Only by investing in good programs can recruiters properly support clients. IT systems that allow monitoring of all relevant diversity across both the internal employee and candidate recruitment lifecycle are now critical to good quality intelligence. Staff should be expected to work to inclusion guiding principles, but businesses need support systems in place and investment in on-going development on the value of diversity to the business. In 2013 Cititec is developing its people in strengths-based leadership. The next step is to use the strengths-based approach in recruitment. cititec man recruitment for a technical w Communicating transparency, especially in equal pay and flexible working, are critical. "Early in 2013 we launched a new Flexible Working Policy. Some of the barriers highlighted during the consultation period helped avoid ill feeling from people who may cover for their colleagues and for non-careers who sometimes feel their needs are overlooked. Now anyone can ask for flexible working and new IT systems mean we have the ability to support them," explains Cititec's CEO Stephen Grant. "Consequently there has been an increase of 33 per cent in senior women employed so far." Later in the year Cititec and Sateo, a specialist equality consultancy, will Citite Development launch Program. Aimed at internal staff, candidates, and clients, the program will bring men and women together to develop key leadership skills based on the strengths finder model. Only by recruiters investing in equality and working in partnership with clients, can issues around gender be explored alongside a problem solving approach. True gender equality can therefore start to be realized, and recruiters are the key to the solution. Directions: Read carefully the article, "The Future Gender Equality".

While Frank acts as the self-assumed leader of the family, thechildren recognize that their mother Lillian, who also works professionallyas a psychologist, is the driving force behind the family. Mother neverthreatened, never shouted or became excited, never spanked a single oneof her children or anyone else. As the children grow, they are taught tobehave differently from children in smaller households. For example, theyall have to come running when the father whistles. While this might seemautocratic, Frank made it a game and to place them quietly upon assembly.Schooling is also emphasized, both in the home and in educationalinstitutions. Frank is very creative in ways he can help his children learnabout the world from a very young age. He is always pushing the childrento advance academically, staying ahead of their peers Frank does this bysurrounding the children with educational games and by creating learningopportunities for them. He is also very involved in their school life, evengoing in to sit in on dasses unexpectedly.1. What does the story tells you?2. Reflect on how the Gilbreth family runs their household.​</h2><br />

                            6. setting:characters:Plot: Beginning  Rising action  Climax  Falling action  Resolution The Greed that Created the Hundred Islands Another legend tells how the islands were created by man's greed for power and other worldly things. The story goes that a kingdom just lost their king in ill health and his people were left without a leader. There were two datus from two warring tribes who are legitimate successors. They were not only rivals to the throne but rivals to the love of a princess named Liglioa who was also a ward to the kingdom's priestess and for a mystic huge pearl which would give wealth to anyone who possesses it, but is mysteriously un-gathered from the bottom of the sea. These two rivals had been fighting for a long time now that the priestess finally consulted the ancestors and the oracle gave her what ought to be done to attain peace and unity for the whole kingdom, which she in turn instructed to the princess. Liglioa then told the two waring datus that whoever wins in the last battle shall win her hand in marriage and the pearl in the bottom of the ocean. The two datus and their tribes prepared long and hard for the upcoming sea battle and by night, bodies and swords were clashing each other. And before daybreak, something strange can be noticed on the dead warriors' bodies and their upturned bancas. They were immobile; and soon grass began to grow on them and became a hundred small islands. The priestess then told Liglioa what happened and the truth about the huge pearl. The real pearl was Liglioa all along, sent to the people by the gods, as they foresaw that the kingdom would be without a ruler when the former king dies. The huge pearl at the bottom of the ocean was a mere illusion made to test the character of that rightful ruler. Fishermen of today still swear that a bit farther of where the islands are now, one can see the mysterious huge pearl mystically gleaming under the clear waters of the sea, beckoning, then disappearing just as swiftly as it came​</h2><br />

                            8. Act with Kindness Story.Once, an ill-mannered man named Shah was slandering Karim, a Muslim prayer leader. After a while, Shah noticed that Karim was not responding to him at all. So he said, "I'm talking to you!" Karim said in response, "And I am ignoring you."Another Muslim prayer leader came. When Shah saw him, he also started shouting and used foul languages towards the second prayer leader. Many of their Muslim brothers heard about this and wanted to punish Shah for what he did and said. But the two Muslim leaders told them to leave him alone.Karim then turned to Shah and greeted him with "Salaam". He asked Shahif he would like to come to his house for food and shelter as he had just come froma long trip.Shah was so surprised for the gesture that he had just received. He thought, "How can this man offer me food and shelter when I had just cursed at his face it cannot be true. He is just trying to shove me away by showing me pretenses," he muttered. The second prayer leader also came to Shah and offered him his drink.Shah soon came to his senses and felt very ashamed of how he had acted and spoken. He asked for their forgiveness and acknowledged the kindness they had given him. After that day, whenever Shah would hear anyone saying anything against the two Muslim prayer leaders, he would gladly correct it.He reciprocated their kindness by doing the same act of goodness to his other Muslim brothers in the community. And, whenever somebody would abuse him and use foul languages at his face, he would say, "I am not hearing you."Shah learned to never get angry at someone when he or she is angry. Neverpunish someone who has hurt you. Instead, act with kindness in your heart.Questions:1.What did karim do when shah slandering him?2. How did karim reciprocate the bad gesture of shah towards him?3. How did shah became a changed man ?4. From then on, how did shah treat those who would abuse and say foul languages to his face ?5.

                            21. "The Future Gender Equality" Robert Grant The future Gender equality Recruiters are key to gender solution, says Robert Grant Recruiters know about hiring, but they could- and arguably should be more influential to businesses around issues of gender equality. But this comes with responsibility and the need for any chosen recruiter to prioritise diversity as a business objective. Monitoring diversity means recruiters can address discrepancies. For example, equally qualified and sometimes more qualified women are not equally hired. Women's tenure is higher in banks than for men and fewer women are employed in the digital industry. To stay competitive, businesses must encourage hiring managers to understand the implications of these trends and should work in partnership with recruiters. Only by investing in good programs can recruiters properly support clients. IT systems that allow monitoring of all relevant diversity across both the internal employee and candidate recruitment lifecycle are now critical to good quality intelligence. Staff should be expected to work to inclusion guiding principles, but businesses need support systems in place and investment in on-going development on the value of diversity to the business. In 2013 Cititec is developing its people in strengths-based leadership. The next step is to use the strengths-based approach in recruitment. cititec man recruitment for a technical w Communicating transparency, especially in equal pay and flexible working, are critical. "Early in 2013 we launched a new Flexible Working Policy. Some of the barriers highlighted during the consultation period helped avoid ill feeling from people who may cover for their colleagues and for non-careers who sometimes feel their needs are overlooked. Now anyone can ask for flexible working and new IT systems mean we have the ability to support them," explains Cititec's CEO Stephen Grant. "Consequently there has been an increase of 33 per cent in senior women employed so far." Later in the year Cititec and Sateo, a specialist equality consultancy, will Citite Development launch Program. Aimed at internal staff, candidates, and clients, the program will bring men and women together to develop key leadership skills based on the strengths finder model. Only by recruiters investing in equality and working in partnership with clients, can issues around gender be explored alongside a problem solving approach. True gender equality can therefore start to be realized, and recruiters are the key to the solution. Directions: Read carefully the article, "The Future Gender Equality".
