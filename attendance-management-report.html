                                            The family business, a fast-food franchise, has two(2) outlets - one in a Quezon city mall and the other in Caloocan City. The fast food outlet supervisors report to the owner-manager, whose office is in the family residence located in Quezon City. The owner's daughters do not attend the meetings as they are either in school or attending to their concerns.
The store supervisors meet with the owner-manager weekly, although the owner's daughters take turns in visiting the outlets every morning, at opening time and evening, at closing time. The owner's daughters give instructions to the store supervisors concerning operations, such as counting supplies and turning over cash sales. Often, the daughters do the purchasing, banking, and delivery task for the outlets.
The owner-manager is thinking of permanently putting his children on the payroll of the enterprise upon their college graduation. One daughter is a college senior, taking up a management course. The other daughter is a student in a culinary course.
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Create an organizational chart for the family food service outlets to include the owner's children.</a>

As of 2.30 pm, President Duterte is expected to deliver his 5th SONA at Batasan," presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a message to reporters.

                                            In one particular deluxe hotel in Metro Manila, the management takes pride in the excellent service given by its staff to all its hotel guests. Approximately 10% of the in-house guests are Filipino balikbayans. One day a Filipino balikbayan checked in with two pieces of luggage – a huge suitcase and a big balikbayan box. The guest was staying only overnight. The bellman brought the luggage to the designated guestroom. The following day, the guest checked out with the same number of luggage. The bellman called for a taxi cab to take the guest to his next destination. The housekeeping attendant entered the vacant guestroom to clean it. The housekeeping attendant was surprised to note that the television unit in the living room was no longer in the armoire or TV cabinet. The housekeeping attendant also found plenty of huge rocks in the bathtub. This was reported right away to security. It was investigated also by the human resources department. This was obviously a case of theft. However, the investigation report also indicated that the housekeeping staff, front desk clerk and bellman were all irresponsible in allowing the guest to check out without clearing the guestroom, i.e. to ensure that nothing is missing. The book value of the missing television set was charged to the negligent employees. </a>

                            7. The family business, a fast-food franchise, has two(2) outlets - one in a Quezon city mall and the other in Caloocan City. The fast food outlet supervisors report to the owner-manager, whose office is in the family residence located in Quezon City. The owner's daughters do not attend the meetings as they are either in school or attending to their concerns.
The store supervisors meet with the owner-manager weekly, although the owner's daughters take turns in visiting the outlets every morning, at opening time and evening, at closing time. The owner's daughters give instructions to the store supervisors concerning operations, such as counting supplies and turning over cash sales. Often, the daughters do the purchasing, banking, and delivery task for the outlets.
The owner-manager is thinking of permanently putting his children on the payroll of the enterprise upon their college graduation. One daughter is a college senior, taking up a management course. The other daughter is a student in a culinary course.
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Create an organizational chart for the family food service outlets to include the owner's children.</h2><br />
                        <p>The <strong>organizational chart</strong> should start with the owner of the stores. He is then followed by his <strong>daughters </strong>who act as the manager of the stores. Then, the rank that is next to his daughters would be the <strong>store supervisor.</strong></p><p></p><p>Here is the explanation of the chart. Attached below is the sample <strong>organizational chart </strong>that the company should follow.</p><p></p><strong>Tier 1 (Owner)<br /></strong>The top-most tier is the <strong>store owner </strong>or the <strong>father</strong>. He is the control center of all the decisions made in every store. Since there are two branches, there should also be two roots after him. One is for the <strong>Caloocan branch</strong> and the other is for the Quezon City branch.<br /><br /><strong>Tier 2 (Daughters and payroll)<br /></strong>The <strong>daughters </strong>play as the s<strong>tore managers</strong> who take turns in visiting the stores every week. Since the owner is planning to put his daughters in the<strong> payroll department</strong> of the enterprise, all payroll-related transactions should be reported to and from them.<br /><br /><strong>Tier 3 (Store supervisors)<br /></strong>The <strong>supervisors </strong>are the head of the branches. They monitor and report the debits and credits of the branch. They would need to report to the <strong>daughters </strong>of the <strong>owner </strong>before relaying the <strong>information </strong>to the store owner.<p></p><p>For more information, please head over to this link:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1013712</p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />

“Roque: Duterte to deliver SONA at Batasan even as some expected attendees tested positive for COVID-19” Published on July 27, 2020 @ 2:50pm and Updated @ 2:53pm
 President Rodrigo Duterte will still deliver his fifth State of the Nation Address (SONA) at the Batasang Pambansa even as some individuals expected to attend the event have contracted COVID-19, Malacañang said Monday. 
 “As of 2:30 [p.m.], President Duterte is expected to deliver his 5th SONA at Batasan,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a message to reporters.
 Roque issued the statement after House Deputy Speaker Johnny Pimentel and at least six Palace personnel who were supposed to render technical support during the SONA tested positive for COVID-19. 
 Only those who will test negative for COVID-19 will be allowed to attend the SONA physically based on the event's safety protocols. 
 Earlier, it was reported that Cabinet executives who tested negative are attending the SONA at the Batasan — Secretaries Menardo Guevarra (Justice), Wendel Avisado (Budget and Management) and Delfin Lorenzana (Defense) as well as presidential spokesperson Harry Roque. 
 Secretaries Eduardo Año (Interior and Local Government) and William Dar (Agriculture) as well as Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles will also be present during the event, according to a separate report by dzBB’s Tuesday Niu. 
 Duterte will deliver his SONA before a joint session of Congress at 4 p.m.

                            28. In one particular deluxe hotel in Metro Manila, the management takes pride in the excellent service given by its staff to all its hotel guests. Approximately 10% of the in-house guests are Filipino balikbayans. One day a Filipino balikbayan checked in with two pieces of luggage – a huge suitcase and a big balikbayan box. The guest was staying only overnight. The bellman brought the luggage to the designated guestroom. The following day, the guest checked out with the same number of luggage. The bellman called for a taxi cab to take the guest to his next destination. The housekeeping attendant entered the vacant guestroom to clean it. The housekeeping attendant was surprised to note that the television unit in the living room was no longer in the armoire or TV cabinet. The housekeeping attendant also found plenty of huge rocks in the bathtub. This was reported right away to security. It was investigated also by the human resources department. This was obviously a case of theft. However, the investigation report also indicated that the housekeeping staff, front desk clerk and bellman were all irresponsible in allowing the guest to check out without clearing the guestroom, i.e. to ensure that nothing is missing. The book value of the missing television set was charged to the negligent employees. </h2><br />
