                                            According to Anna Freud of National Centre for Children and Families, discrimination is when a person is treated unfairly because of who they are, this can have a detrimental effect on their mental health, their self-esteem and educational performance. Disability, age discrimination, race, skin color and sex, religious discrimination, gender identity, place of birth and status as a parent etc., are one of the many critical situations that can lead to discrimination which cannot be undone but can be minimized through learning to be responsible on making value judgements. It is important to understand what value judgement is. Value judgement is a judgement of the rightness or wrongness of something, or someone based on a comparison or other relativity or of the usefulness of something or someone. It does not simply describe the world; they prescribe certain attitudes or behaviors toward the world. It is based more on perceptual understanding on a certain issue; a claim that a particular human action or object has some degree of importance, worth or desirability. 2022.04.13 18:41​</a>

                            24. According to Anna Freud of National Centre for Children and Families, discrimination is when a person is treated unfairly because of who they are, this can have a detrimental effect on their mental health, their self-esteem and educational performance. Disability, age discrimination, race, skin color and sex, religious discrimination, gender identity, place of birth and status as a parent etc., are one of the many critical situations that can lead to discrimination which cannot be undone but can be minimized through learning to be responsible on making value judgements. It is important to understand what value judgement is. Value judgement is a judgement of the rightness or wrongness of something, or someone based on a comparison or other relativity or of the usefulness of something or someone. It does not simply describe the world; they prescribe certain attitudes or behaviors toward the world. It is based more on perceptual understanding on a certain issue; a claim that a particular human action or object has some degree of importance, worth or desirability. 2022.04.13 18:41​</h2><br />
