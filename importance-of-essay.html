                            1. ESSAY: Write a short essay explaining the importance of recycling. Use the template below. Importance of Recycling​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Reducing waste, reusing materials and products, and recycling are some of the most extremely powerful ways individual, households, and business can protect environmental. By simply making smart decisions as to what we buy and how we get the most away from our purchases, we can work together to lower the amount of waste. Reusing discarded products and using recycled materials in order to make new products reduces the usage of virgin materials, which often involves harvesting trees and mining the earth. Even better, “source reducing” waste — or avoiding the generation of discards in the first place — saves the absolute most resources. Manufacturers of natural resources, such as bauxite or aluminum ore, and improving them to make products use energy. Often fossil fuels produce this energy. When people throw away these things, they send them to landfills, where they can last for centuries or more completely to split up. Reducing, reusing, and recycling helps reduce human exposure to the environment, carbon dioxide emissions, and energy use, and limits the number of people in the landfill.</strong></p>But most importantly, it will help us to save our planet. Besides, recycling saves the earth by facilitating the reprocess of paper which will save millions of trees. Also, recycling saves a lot of energy because many things that we recycle can easily be converted into virgin materials. In addition, it saves a lot of resources too. Moreover, recycling reduces the burden on the environment. As we save energy the number of greenhouse gases and oxides are produced in less quantity. Because most of the toxic gases are produced by factories. But, the process of plastic recycling is a little bit complex because they have to sort out the different types of plastics. As there is a diverse variety of plastic with different properties. In addition, sort your waste and dump your recyclable waste in the recycle bin so that the authorities can recycle it.<p>   </p><p></p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p><strong>Paki highlight nalang po yung important stuff</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Etiquette, like all other cultural behaviors, evolves to match the times. Without etiquette, members of society would show far too much impatience and disrespect for one another, which would lead to insults, dishonesty, cheating, road rage, fist fights, and a rash of other unfortunate incidents. Etiquette is merely a set of guidelines for politeness and good manners, the kindnesses with which we should always treat each other. It will always matter. It helps us show respect and consideration to others and makes others glad that we are with them. Without proper manners and etiquette, the customs of polite society would soon disappear and we would act more like animals and less like people. Aggressiveness and an "every man for himself" attitude would take the lead. In earlier times, the rules of etiquette were used for two purposes: to remind people of their own status within society and to reinforce certain restrictions on individuals within that society.</p><p></p><p></p>Some people argue that etiquette no longer matters, that the rules for good behavior are old-fashioned and out of date.  However, good behavior and manners are never out of style. Etiquette, like all other cultural behaviors, evolves to match the times. Without etiquette, members of society would show far too much impatience and disrespect for one another, which would lead to insults, dishonesty, cheating, road rage, fist fights, and a rash of other unfortunate incidents. <br /><br />Etiquette is merely a set of guidelines for politeness and good manners, the kindnesses with which we should always treat each other. It will always matter! <br /><br /> The complex network of rules that govern good behavior and our social and business interactions, is always evolving and changing as society changes.  It reflects our cultural norms, generally accepted ethical codes, and the rules of various groups we belong to.   <br /><br />It helps us show respect and consideration to others and makes others glad that we are with them. Without proper manners and etiquette, the customs of polite society would soon disappear and we would act more like animals and less like people. Aggressiveness and an "every man for himself" attitude would take the lead. <br /><br />In earlier times, the rules of etiquette were used for two purposes: to remind people of their own status within society and to reinforce certain restrictions on individuals within that society.<br /><br />In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, for instance, etiquette dictated everything from how low a person of inferior rank had to bow to a person of higher rank to how long a man had to spend courting a woman before the two could marry. <br /><br />Even the way a person mourned was strictly outlined by rules of etiquette until as recently as the Civil War era in the United States. Widows then were expected to dress in "widow's weeds," or completely black clothing and veils, for a full year after the death of a husband. <br /><br />These types of rules in earlier society were usually determined by the ruling classes because they served the purpose of making them more secure in their roles as the rulers of society. By far, the most strenuously enforced rules of etiquette were tied to how one showed respect for the king and his highest ranking officials, such as dukes and princes.  It reinforced their authority. <br /><br />The rules of etiquette concerning marriage, mourning, and other major events of life largely applied only to the ruling classes or the wealthy. Peasants and workers, as long as they followed the rules of etiquette pertaining to respecting their superiors, were not expected to follow formalized rules of courtship; they tended to base their own "rules" of courtship on good manners and common sense.<br /><br />Over the centuries, as society has become more democratic, etiquette has become an excellent combination of good manners, common sense, and rules of conduct that reflect cultural norms and the rules of our society as a whole rather than just one distinct group within it.  It has less to do with the fashion of the moment or who is in power and more to do with putting others at ease and an ethical code of conduct.<br />

                            4. importance of cell essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>The cell is a basic unit of life as no living organism can have life without being cellular because the cell is a unit of both its structure and function. All life begins as a single cell. A number of organisms are made of single cells. They are called unicellular or acellular, e.g.Amoeba, Chlamydomonas, Acetabularia, bacteria, and yeast.</strong><p></p><p><strong>Here a single cell is:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>(i) Capable of independent existence and</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>(ii) Able to perform all the essential functions of life.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Anything less than a complete cell can neither lead an independent existence nor perform all life functions. A multicellular organism is made of many cells. A higher animal or plant contains billions of cells. For example, a newly born human infant has 2 x 1012 cells.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The number increases to 100 trillion (100 x 1012 or 1014) cells in the body of 60 kg human beings. About 25% (25 x 1012) of them are found in the blood. A drop of blood contains several million cells. The large sized organisms do not have large-sized cells. Instead, they possess a higher number of cells. In multicellular organisms, cells are building blocks of the body or basic units of body structure.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Of course, they become specialized for performing different func­tions. The human body has some 200 types of cells, e.g., erythrocytes, leucocyte types, epithelial cell types, muscle cells, nerve cells, fat cells, cartilage cells, bone cells, connective tissue cells, gland cells, germinal cells, pigment cells, etc</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Cells are grouped into tissues, tissues into organs, and organs into organ systems. The occurrence of different types of tissues, organs, and organ systems results in the division of labor or the performance of different functions of the body by specialized structures.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Cells are not only the building blocks of organisms, they are also the functional units of life. Life passes from one generation to the next in the form of cells.</strong></p><p><strong>The activities of an organism are actually the sum total of the activities of its cells. Each cell of the body possesses the same genetic information though mature cells may become specialized to perform spe­cific functions. A new cell always develops by the division of a pre-existing cell.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Cells are totipotent, i.e., a single cell has the ability to form the whole organism. Internally each cell is build up of several organelles. The organelles perform different functions just like the ones carried on by different organ systems of the body.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>All life activities of the organism are present in miniature form in each and every cell of its body. Thus, cell is a basic unit of life and structural and functional unit of an organism. It is the smallest unit capable of independent existence and performing the essential functions of life.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>BRAINLIEST  ME PLS </strong><strong>TY</strong><br />
