                                            Anne is the project manager of a large industrial project in a developing country, run by a Nordic company. On a crucial day for the project, the electricity is suddenly gone from the entire plant. Large quantities of cement are about to congeal in the blenders, and it is crucial to activate them again, quickly. More than a thousand employees are unable to do their work. Anne contacts the local authorities to solve the problem. A bureaucrat turns up at the plant and explains that he can get the electricity back on again very quickly, on the condition that he can bring ten of the company's PCs back to the town hall. There is a desperate shortage of PCs there, and the bureaucrat and his colleagues are therefore unable to do provide adequate service to the local community. Thus, he suggests a trade-off: PCs for electricity. In this manner, Anne and her company can make a significant contribution to the society in which they operate. of the essence, and Anne has little time to dwell on the alternatives. There is time to contact top management in her home country to get advice or instructions about what to do. She this by herself. If the cement congeals today, will mean a considerable delay in the project. Several operations will have to be redone, at a high cost, particularly compared to cost of losing ten PCs that can be easily replaced. Anne also has sympathy the local bureaucrats and the population they are serving. They probably make very good use of the PCs. On the other hand, if gives in to blackmail this time, the same may happen again, at other crucial stages of the project. Anne faces difficult choice. What should she do? Anne wants to honor the moral value of finishing the project on time and within budget, but also the moral value of not giving in to blackmail or corruption. One of these values will have to give way at expense of the other. There is no harmonious way out, where Anne says that she has done everything right.</a>

                                            Norms are purely internal. Many people today reject any moral norms or standards which would be based on the existence of values outside of us, and they argue that the only valid rules are purely internal: be true to yourself, do what you feel is right, follow your conscience. But at best these so-called internal norms beg the question: To which self-am I to be true? Not only do we change, but we are divided, vacillating in respect to a most important de- cision; within each of us there are competing selves clamoring for attention, and it is pos- sible that the self which I am at the moment is not the self which I ought to be. It is also possible that "what I feel is right" might not be right at all. It is even possible that my con- science, in a given case, might be the product of self-deception, or might be a false facad for selfishness. These internal norms, such as conscience, make sense only if they are base on something outside of us as individuals, which can rightfully lay total claim to us. 1. Evaluation:​</a>

                                            Instruction: Write a complete poem from this text: Importance of Asian Literature The historical experiences of people in Asia have been interwoven for centuries if not millennia, owing to their close and vast geography as well as years of trade and conquests. Naturally, while each Asian country has a unique literary style, their literature also reflects the similarities in their customs and traditions, struggles and successes, even their philosophies in life, giving the rest of the world a better understanding of Asian culture. This is hugely important especially to Western people in the past since they did not know a lot of Asia, much less its people’s ways of living, due to both their geographic and cultural distances. The differences between Western and Eastern culture manifests even until today. However, Asian literature brings their people’s lives straight from reality to the pages that then take their stories into the hearts of others worldwide, where they somehow find a common ground of shared experiences. Asian literature goes to show that despite the distance and differences, we are all connected through the tales that we have in common with each other. Not only does Asian literature give us an original and fresh take on people’s experiences, but it also contributes to our collective perception of life through the morals and philosophies that their literary pieces embody. One Thousand and One Nights, a collection of Arabian folk tales, is the epitome of the value-centered pieces of Asian literature. In its hundreds of stories, just as many moral lessons can be gleaned. To name a few, Aladdin’s Wonderful Lamp teaches us the meaning of identity and how it is based on merit, not wealth; Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves characterizes loyalty, honesty, and generosity; The Tale of the Hunchback calls out to the persistence of truth and our conscience. Asian literature has also aided the spread of Asian spirituality, heightening the major religions that we know and are a part of until today—all of which started in the continent itself: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam having originated from West Asia, Hinduism and Buddhism from the South, and Confucianism and Taoism from the East. Examples of literary texts that support religions range from the Tao Te Ching that exemplifies Taoism, the Analects that epitomizes Confucianism, to the Sanskrit epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata that are important to Hinduism, amongst many others that knit the patchwork of Asian religions. Asian literature has impacted our lives, whether we know it or not. It is there in the way that we view certain aspects of life—such as struggles, injustices, death—, and it is there in the way that we treat life itself. Throughout the years and until today, all over the world, Asian literature has helped shape our ideals and lifestyles. It is only right that we trace the origins of such a powerful medium that has moved our minds.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>yes</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>the amount of time spent online, are the findings that suggest social media use can actually influence users’ personality and character. Recent research, for example, shown that there is a link between social media use and narcissism, and that the use of social networking websites may have an adverse effect on social decision making and reduce levels of empathy.</p><p></p><p>Then there is the issue that the very nature of the internet, with it’s perceived invisibility and anonymity, can also mean people act differently online, compared to how they would in real life.

Large quantities of cement are about to congeal in the blenders, and it is crucial to activate them again, quickly. More than a thousand employees are unable to do their work. Anne contacts the local authorities to solve the problem. A bureaucrat turns up at the plant and explains that he can get the electricity back on again very quickly, on the condition that he can bring ten of the company's PCs back to the town hall. There is a desperate shortage of PCs there, and the bureaucrat and his colleagues are therefore unable to do provide adequate service to the local community. Thus, he suggests a trade-off: PCs for electricity. In this manner, Anne and her company can make a significant contribution to the society in which they operate. of the essence, and Anne has little time to dwell on the alternatives. There is time to contact top management in her home country to get advice or instructions about what to do. She this by herself. If the cement congeals today, will mean a considerable delay in the project. Several operations will have to be redone, at a high cost, particularly compared to cost of losing ten PCs that can be easily replaced. Anne also has sympathy the local bureaucrats and the population they are serving. They probably make very good use of the PCs. On the other hand, if gives in to blackmail this time, the same may happen again, at other crucial stages of the project. Anne faces difficult choice. What should she do? Anne wants to honor the moral value of finishing the project on time and within budget, but also the moral value of not giving in to blackmail or corruption. One of these values will have to give way at expense of the other. There is no harmonious way out, where Anne says that she has done everything right.</h2><br />

                            14. Norms are purely internal. Many people today reject any moral norms or standards which would be based on the existence of values outside of us, and they argue that the only valid rules are purely internal: be true to yourself, do what you feel is right, follow your conscience. But at best these so-called internal norms beg the question: To which self-am I to be true? Not only do we change, but we are divided, vacillating in respect to a most important de- cision; within each of us there are competing selves clamoring for attention, and it is pos- sible that the self which I am at the moment is not the self which I ought to be. It is also possible that "what I feel is right" might not be right at all. It is even possible that my con- science, in a given case, might be the product of self-deception, or might be a false facad for selfishness. These internal norms, such as conscience, make sense only if they are base on something outside of us as individuals, which can rightfully lay total claim to us. 1. Evaluation:​</h2><br />
                        <p>This passage discusses the idea of moral norms and standards and the role they play in guiding human behavior. The author argues against the notion that moral rules should be based solely on internal values, such as being true to oneself or following one's conscience. The author suggests that these internal norms are problematic because they are subjective and can be influenced by factors such as self-deception or selfishness. Instead, the author proposes that moral norms should be based on something outside of individuals, which has the authority to lay claim to us. This argument highlights the importance of considering the source of our moral beliefs and the need for an external standard to guide our behavior. Overall, the passage provides a thoughtful critique of the idea that internal values alone are sufficient to guide our actions.</p><br />

                            15. Instruction: Write a complete poem from this text: Importance of Asian Literature The historical experiences of people in Asia have been interwoven for centuries if not millennia, owing to their close and vast geography as well as years of trade and conquests. Naturally, while each Asian country has a unique literary style, their literature also reflects the similarities in their customs and traditions, struggles and successes, even their philosophies in life, giving the rest of the world a better understanding of Asian culture. This is hugely important especially to Western people in the past since they did not know a lot of Asia, much less its people’s ways of living, due to both their geographic and cultural distances. The differences between Western and Eastern culture manifests even until today. However, Asian literature brings their people’s lives straight from reality to the pages that then take their stories into the hearts of others worldwide, where they somehow find a common ground of shared experiences. Asian literature goes to show that despite the distance and differences, we are all connected through the tales that we have in common with each other. Not only does Asian literature give us an original and fresh take on people’s experiences, but it also contributes to our collective perception of life through the morals and philosophies that their literary pieces embody. One Thousand and One Nights, a collection of Arabian folk tales, is the epitome of the value-centered pieces of Asian literature. In its hundreds of stories, just as many moral lessons can be gleaned. To name a few, Aladdin’s Wonderful Lamp teaches us the meaning of identity and how it is based on merit, not wealth; Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves characterizes loyalty, honesty, and generosity; The Tale of the Hunchback calls out to the persistence of truth and our conscience. Asian literature has also aided the spread of Asian spirituality, heightening the major religions that we know and are a part of until today—all of which started in the continent itself: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam having originated from West Asia, Hinduism and Buddhism from the South, and Confucianism and Taoism from the East. Examples of literary texts that support religions range from the Tao Te Ching that exemplifies Taoism, the Analects that epitomizes Confucianism, to the Sanskrit epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata that are important to Hinduism, amongst many others that knit the patchwork of Asian religions. Asian literature has impacted our lives, whether we know it or not. It is there in the way that we view certain aspects of life—such as struggles, injustices, death—, and it is there in the way that we treat life itself. Throughout the years and until today, all over the world, Asian literature has helped shape our ideals and lifestyles. It is only right that we trace the origins of such a powerful medium that has moved our minds.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Morality and religion is the relationship between religious views and morals. Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the Triple Gems of Jainism, Islam's Sharia, Catholicism's Canon Law, Buddhism's Eightfold Path, and Zoroastrianism's "good thoughts, good words, and good deeds" concept, among others. These frameworks are outlined and interpreted by various sources such as holy books, oral and written traditions, and religious leaders. Many of these share tenets with secular value frameworks such as consequentialism, freethought, and utilitarianism.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>I</strong><strong> </strong><strong>HOPE</strong><strong> </strong><strong>IT'S</strong><strong> </strong><strong>HELP</strong><strong> </strong></p><br />

Instead, in recent years, the focus of parenting has switched to child-centered practices. As a result, today's children are frequently let off the hook and rarely held responsible for their behavior.Moral principles are essential at all stages of life. However, the majority of the beliefs we hold as adults were implanted in us as children. As a result, it's critical that we instill in our children the values we want them to possess as adults. Early exposure to positive moral principles such as kindness, humility, courage, and compassion helps to shape a child's character.
