Circle any signal words that could be used to help identify the text type and underline any other words or phrases that helped you make your decision Passages	Pattern1. There are several reasons why so many people attend the Olympic games or watch them on television. One reason is tradition. The name Olympics and the torch and flame remind people of the ancient games. People can escape the ordinariness of daily life by attending or watching the Olympics. They like to identify with someone else’s individual sacrifice and accomplishment. National pride is another reason, and an athlete’s or a team’s hard-earned victory becomes a nation’s victory. There are national medal counts and people keep track of how many medals their country’s athletes have won. 	2. One problem with the modern Olympics is that it has become very big and expensive to operate. The city or country that hosts the games often loses a lot of money. A stadium, pools, and playing fields must be built for the athletic events and housing is needed for the athletes who come from around the world. And all of these facilities are used for only two weeks! In 1984 Los Angeles solved these problems by charging a fee for companies who wanted to be official sponsors of the games. Companies like McDonald’s paid a lot of money to be part of the Olympics. Many buildings that were already built in Los Angeles area were also used. The coliseum where the 1932 games were held was used again and many colleges and universities in the area became playing and living areas. 	3. A phobia is an intense fear or feeling of anxiety that occurs only in a particular situation that frightens you. This might be something as seemingly logical as a fear of heights, or as illogical as a fear of the color green. At other times you don’t feel anxious. For example, if you have a phobia of spiders (as millions of people do), you only feel anxious when there’s a spider around, otherwise you feel fine. About one in ten people has a significant phobia, although few people seek treatment. 	4. “Mom, I believe that it is very necessary for me to have my own tablet,” Keisha said persuasively. And Mom answered with a teasing smile on her face, “Honey, but your current situation shows the contrary.” 	​</a>

                                            Lesson 1 Geologic Processes and Hazards What's In Geology is the study of the Earth and its history. It involves studying the materials that make up the earth, the features and structures found on Earth, as well as the processes that act upon them. It also deals with the study of the history of all life living on the earth now. How do geological processes occur? Geological processes are naturally occurring events that directly or indirectly impact the geology of the Earth. Examples of geological processes include events such as plate tectonics, weathering, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, mountain formation, deposition, erosion, droughts, flooding, and landslides. Geological processes affect every human on the Earth all of the time, but are most noticeable when they cause loss of life or property. These threatening processes are called natural disasters. How about Geologic Hazards? A geologic hazard is an extreme natural event in the crust of the earth that poses a threat to life and property, for example, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis (tidal waves) and landslides. It is a large-scale, complex natural events that happen on land. These hazards can cause immense damage, loss of property, and sometimes life. Geologic hazards can play a significant role when infrastructure is constructed in their presence. The unpredictable nature of natural geologic hazards makes identifying, evaluating, and mitigating against them a unique challenge. .​</a>

Circle any signal words that could be used to help identify the text type and underlineany other words or phrases that helped you make your decision.Passages Pattern1. There are several reasons why so many people attend theOlympic games or watch them on television. One reason istradition. The name Olympics and the torch and flame remindpeople of the ancient games. People can escape the ordinariness ofdaily life by attending or watching the Olympics. They like toidentify with someone else’s individual sacrifice andaccomplishment. National pride is another reason, and an athlete’sor a team’s hard-earned victory becomes a nation’s victory. Thereare national medal counts and people keep track of how manymedals their country’s athletes have won.2. One problem with the modern Olympics is that it has becomevery big and expensive to operate. The city or country that hoststhe games often loses a lot of money. A stadium, pools, andplaying fields must be built for the athletic events and housing isneeded for the athletes who come from around the world. And allof these facilities are used for only two weeks! In 1984 LosAngeles solved these problems by charging a fee for companieswho wanted to be official sponsors of the games. Companies likeMcDonald’s paid a lot of money to be part of the Olympics. Manybuildings that were already built in Los Angeles area were alsoused. The coliseum where the 1932 games were held was usedagain and many colleges and universities in the area becameplaying and living areas.3.

About one in ten people has a significant phobia,although few people seek treatment.4. “Mom, I believe that it is very necessary for me to have my owntablet,” Keisha said persuasively. And Mom answered with ateasing smile on her face, “Honey, but your current situation showsthe contrary.​</a>

There are several reasons why so many people attend theOlympic games or watch them on television. One reason istradition. The name Olympics and the torch and flame remindpeople of the ancient games. People can escape the ordinarinessof daily life by attending or watching the Olympics. They like toidentify with someone else’s individual sacrifice andaccomplishment. National pride is another reason, and an athlete’sor a team’s hard-earned victory becomes a nation’s victory.There are national medal counts and people keep track of howmany medals their country’s athletes have won.2. One problem with the modern Olympics is that it has becomevery big and expensive to operate. The city or country that hoststhe games often loses a lot of money. A stadium, pools, andplaying fields must be built for the athletic events and housing isneeded for the athletes who come from around the world. And all ofthese facilities are used for only two weeks! In 1984 Los Angelessolved these problems by charging a fee for companies whowanted to be official sponsors of the games. Companies likeMcDonald’s paid a lot of money to be part of the Olympics. Manybuildings that were already built in Los Angeles area were alsoused. The coliseum where the 1932 games were held was usedagain and many colleges and universities in the area became playing and living areas.3. A phobia is an intense fear or feeling of anxiety that occurs onlyin a particular situation that frightens you. This might be somethingas seemingly logical as a fear of heights, or as illogical as a fear ofthe color green. At other times you don’t feel anxious. For example,if you have a phobia of spiders (as millions of people do), you onlyfeel anxious when there’s a spider around, otherwise you feel fine.About one in ten people has a significant phobia, although fewpeople seek treatment.4. “Mom, I believe that it is very necessary for me to have my owntablet,” Keisha said persuasively.

                            6. Lesson 1 Geologic Processes and Hazards What's In Geology is the study of the Earth and its history. It involves studying the materials that make up the earth, the features and structures found on Earth, as well as the processes that act upon them. It also deals with the study of the history of all life living on the earth now. How do geological processes occur? Geological processes are naturally occurring events that directly or indirectly impact the geology of the Earth. Examples of geological processes include events such as plate tectonics, weathering, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, mountain formation, deposition, erosion, droughts, flooding, and landslides. Geological processes affect every human on the Earth all of the time, but are most noticeable when they cause loss of life or property. These threatening processes are called natural disasters. How about Geologic Hazards? A geologic hazard is an extreme natural event in the crust of the earth that poses a threat to life and property, for example, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis (tidal waves) and landslides. It is a large-scale, complex natural events that happen on land. These hazards can cause immense damage, loss of property, and sometimes life. Geologic hazards can play a significant role when infrastructure is constructed in their presence. The unpredictable nature of natural geologic hazards makes identifying, evaluating, and mitigating against them a unique challenge. .​</h2><br />

Circle any signal words that could be used to help identify the text type and underlineany other words or phrases that helped you make your decision.Passages Pattern1. There are several reasons why so many people attend theOlympic games or watch them on television. One reason istradition. The name Olympics and the torch and flame remindpeople of the ancient games. People can escape the ordinariness ofdaily life by attending or watching the Olympics. They like toidentify with someone else’s individual sacrifice andaccomplishment. National pride is another reason, and an athlete’sor a team’s hard-earned victory becomes a nation’s victory. Thereare national medal counts and people keep track of how manymedals their country’s athletes have won.2. One problem with the modern Olympics is that it has becomevery big and expensive to operate. The city or country that hoststhe games often loses a lot of money. A stadium, pools, andplaying fields must be built for the athletic events and housing isneeded for the athletes who come from around the world. And allof these facilities are used for only two weeks! In 1984 LosAngeles solved these problems by charging a fee for companieswho wanted to be official sponsors of the games. Companies likeMcDonald’s paid a lot of money to be part of the Olympics. Manybuildings that were already built in Los Angeles area were alsoused. The coliseum where the 1932 games were held was usedagain and many colleges and universities in the area becameplaying and living areas.3. A phobia is an intense fear or feeling of anxiety that occurs onlyin a particular situation that frightens you.

At other times you don’t feel anxious.For example, if you have a phobia of spiders (as millions of peopledo), you only feel anxious when there’s a spider around, otherwiseyou feel fine. About one in ten people has a significant phobia,although few people seek treatment.4. “Mom, I believe that it is very necessary for me to have my owntablet,” Keisha said persuasively. And Mom answered with ateasing smile on her face, “Honey, but your current situation showsthe contrary.​</h2><br />
