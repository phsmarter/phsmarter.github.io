Use a separate sheet of paper for your answer. Direction: Read and understand carefulh the text below and answer the graphic organizer that follows. It is a given fact that Philippines undergo several typhoons every year but it seems that we are not learning from it. Looking back, when you compare the casualties of catastrophic typhoons that hit the Philippines the trends seem to show that we are not really prepared to face these disasters. For instance, on 23 September 2009, Ondoy affected almost 993,227 families, making it to become one of the worst natural disasters in the Philippines in terms of number of people affected. Out of this attected people, 464 were killed and 520 were injured and a total of 15,798 families were temporarily displaced and took refuge in evacuation centers (Olan, 2014). On the same note, on the 15th day of 2011, Sendong hit the northern part of Mindanao and killed almost 1,439 people. The estimated cost of damages by Typhoon Sendong amounted to P999, 946,415 or close to 1 billion and left 65,067 families homeless (Rappler, 2011). Lastly, Typhoon Haiyan, dubbed as the strongest typhoon to land in the recorded history, affected almost 16 million people, leaving in its wake 6,300 deaths, 4.1 million displaced people and 1.1 million houses damaged (USAID, 2014). When you make sense of these numbers, one can readily grasp that we are not resilient in the face of disasters, we are ill-prepared.

                            6. Activity 1: Anticipation Guide To start with answer the anticipation guide below to check how much you know about the topic. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answer. Direction: Read and understand carefulh the text below and answer the graphic organizer that follows. It is a given fact that Philippines undergo several typhoons every year but it seems that we are not learning from it. Looking back, when you compare the casualties of catastrophic typhoons that hit the Philippines the trends seem to show that we are not really prepared to face these disasters. For instance, on 23 September 2009, Ondoy affected almost 993,227 families, making it to become one of the worst natural disasters in the Philippines in terms of number of people affected. Out of this attected people, 464 were killed and 520 were injured and a total of 15,798 families were temporarily displaced and took refuge in evacuation centers (Olan, 2014). On the same note, on the 15th day of 2011, Sendong hit the northern part of Mindanao and killed almost 1,439 people. The estimated cost of damages by Typhoon Sendong amounted to P999, 946,415 or close to 1 billion and left 65,067 families homeless (Rappler, 2011). Lastly, Typhoon Haiyan, dubbed as the strongest typhoon to land in the recorded history, affected almost 16 million people, leaving in its wake 6,300 deaths, 4.1 million displaced people and 1.1 million houses damaged (USAID, 2014). When you make sense of these numbers, one can readily grasp that we are not resilient in the face of disasters, we are ill-prepared.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>1.   <strong>Changing states of matter occur when matter loses or absorbs energy. When a substance absorbs energy the atoms and molecules move more rapidly and this increased kinetic energy pushes particles far enough, that they change form.<br /><br />2.  Like gases, plasma's have no fixed shape or volume, and are less dense than solids or liquids. But unlike ordinary gases, plasma's are made up of atoms in which some or all of the electrons have been stripped away and positively charged nuclei, <br /><br />3.   Solids have a fixed volume and fixed shape. Solids cannot be compressed. liquids take up the shape of their container but have a fixed volume.<br /><br /></strong></p><strong></strong><p></p><br />
