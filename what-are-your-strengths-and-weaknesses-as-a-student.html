                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I think its need your own answer. It looks like reflection about the lesson discussed:)</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.) It is because of the brain's elasticity and rapid neural formation that babies and young children are able to learn languages at a faster rate. This is sometimes referred to as the “critical period</p><p></p><p>2.) Can achievement be broken down into steps? It isn’t always that clean and easy, but those who achieve great things usually go through much of the same process, with many of the items listed below as part of that process. So if you have been struggling with achievement, look through the following. Begin to apply them and you will be on the road to achieving your dream.</p><p></p><p>3.) When it comes to solving problems and making tough decisions, people love plans (especially their own plans), so they make a lot of them. And because they want the perfect plan, they demand more data to help them.</p><p></p><p>Inevitably, though, this takes longer and longer, and instead of the goal being to reach a decision, the process of making the decision becomes the goal.</p><p></p><p>There may be studies, hearings and debates, but nothing actually gets done. This can go on for quite a while, depending on the nature of the decision ... all because everyone wants the perfect plan.</p><p></p><p>4.) Before you can change your life, you have to believe that ... Obstacles That Prevent People From Living Their Dreams.</p><p></p><p>5.) Life is beautiful! And even more so if you are living a life filled with happiness, peace and contribution. However, many people, including myself, have lived a life full of possessions, with a soul full of hatred, a job that sucks the very life out of them, and an emptiness inside.</p><p></p><p>Even with its struggles and difficulties life can be beautiful, depending what you focus on. A beautiful life is one that makes you feel fully alive, is full of inspiration and creates a deeper, more connected environment for us to live in. With this in mind I’ve come up with a few steps on how to live a beautiful life.</p><br />
