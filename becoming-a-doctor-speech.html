ANSWER
FRONTLINERS KEEP UP
In this time of the pandemic, we have a lot to face about how to continue our education in school, how to continue earning a living in the midst of the pandemic and how to stay safe in the face of what is happening now in the crisis it has brought. many are infected and even more so. in the midst of our fears there are people in front of us they are the people who have the same oath it is to save lives and protect the country they are the people who become our defense they are the people who sacrifice their own lives for others . doctors police soldiers nurses other health workers village guards and many more that I did not mention they sacrifice their lives in front without hesitation however it is sad to think that there are people who are being ostracized and discriminated against because they say they can be infected with virus if we understand it is inevitable because of people’s fear but we should also look at the other side of their lives they have families waiting for them they have families that care about them. there is a saying there is only one life so we must be carefu.l in the crisis we are going through now the people in front symbolize life and hope so we must respect them keep up frontliners and never give up on your sworn duty.</a>

                                            Philippines Finally Receives First Batch of COVID-19 Vaccine The Philippines launched its national coronavirus vaccination campaign Monday amid widespread public skepticism and a struggle to procure vaccines. Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, the director of the state-run Philippine General Hospital in Manlla, received the first dose of the CoronaVac vaccine developed by China- based Sinovac Biotech Limited. The doctor's inoculation came just hours after President Rodrigo Duterte greeted the arrival of 600,000 doses of Sinovac donated by Beijing. The Philippines is the last Southeast Asian nation to receive a COVID 19 vaccine supply. The Duterte administration is aiming to vaccinate 70 million of its citizens, but some public opinion polls have revealed a resistance among most people due to uncertainty over the safety and efficacy of the CoronaVac vaccine. But Carlito Galvez, who is leading the Philippines' vaccine procurement efforts, urged his compatriots to get the first vaccine that becomes available. "Let's not wait for the best vaccine. There's no such thing," Galvez said in a speech at the Philippine General Hospital. "The best vaccine is the one that's safe and effective and arrives early." But just receiving vaccines has been an issue. An expected shipment of 525,600 doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine that was due Monday has been postponed due to supply problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the Pacific archipelago, sickening more than 576,000 people, including 12,318 deaths, the second highest in the region. President Duterte has vowed to ease some of the restrictions imposed to boost the Philippine economy once more vaccines are available. (Excerpt from VOA News, March 01, 2021) 1.

                            7. Philippines Finally Receives First Batch of COVID-19 Vaccine The Philippines launched its national coronavirus vaccination campaign Monday amid widespread public skepticism and a struggle to procure vaccines. Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, the director of the state-run Philippine General Hospital in Manlla, received the first dose of the CoronaVac vaccine developed by China- based Sinovac Biotech Limited. The doctor's inoculation came just hours after President Rodrigo Duterte greeted the arrival of 600,000 doses of Sinovac donated by Beijing. The Philippines is the last Southeast Asian nation to receive a COVID 19 vaccine supply. The Duterte administration is aiming to vaccinate 70 million of its citizens, but some public opinion polls have revealed a resistance among most people due to uncertainty over the safety and efficacy of the CoronaVac vaccine. But Carlito Galvez, who is leading the Philippines' vaccine procurement efforts, urged his compatriots to get the first vaccine that becomes available. "Let's not wait for the best vaccine. There's no such thing," Galvez said in a speech at the Philippine General Hospital. "The best vaccine is the one that's safe and effective and arrives early." But just receiving vaccines has been an issue. An expected shipment of 525,600 doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine that was due Monday has been postponed due to supply problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the Pacific archipelago, sickening more than 576,000 people, including 12,318 deaths, the second highest in the region. President Duterte has vowed to ease some of the restrictions imposed to boost the Philippine economy once more vaccines are available. (Excerpt from VOA News, March 01, 2021) 1.
