Answer briefly the questions that tells about how the gamer uses his body The Virtual Gamer by: Von RJ Josol I play the game from morning 'til night Never miss the chance to win the fight For I am destined to withstand the game I aim for victory and fame! I skip my meals and liquids, while I fight No breakfast, lunch, nor dinner at night: Eating was a burden, I tell my mind Cause a virtual gamer will never mind Then suddenly! On a clear daylight I felt something, I did not delight My hands are trembling, and little tummy burning! A crushing headache is very frightening My vision gets dimmer, A body thinner, weaker and cooler Help! Body organs are failing! I must do something or else I'll lose everything. I learned a lesson that every gamer must keep Inside your body are busy organs, even when you're asleep United in their functions, they work together as one Nourish your body organs and you will be a tough one Love your body, for you only have one; Be better, stronger, and smarter than ever. Because you can never win your battle, if your body is gone. For a virtual gamer checks his facts more than ever. Question How will your body react if you do not eat food and drink water in a day? 10​</a>

Walking on the Moon
When I was in Grade 3, I got to take a trip to the moon. I remember
the day like it was yesterday. It was one of the strangest experiences I’d
ever had.
It all started when Miss Reyes, our Grade 3 Science teacher, was
showing a video about the different planets in the solar system. Halfway
through the video, I noticed a sparkling metal disc, about the size of a peso
18
PIVOT 4A CALABARZON
E
coin, lying on the floor. I kept trying to pay attention to the video, but found
myself bending over to pick up the shiny disk that was next to my desk.
As soon as I touched the metal disk, something strange happened.
I wasn’t in the classroom anymore. I was hovering in the air, way above
the school. I could see the whole or rather the rooftops of the whole city.
I was a little nervous, but also pretty excited. What was happening? How
could I be floating?
It was then when I remembered the metal disk I’d picked up from
the floor earlier. Did it I have something to do with the strange things that
were happening to me right now? I opened my palm and looked closely at
the disk. On the disk were these words:
“Floating through the air, like a helium filled balloon, your travels will
not stop, until you reach the moon”
The next thing I knew, I was soaring through space, dodging
satellites and asteroids. Oddly enough, I wasn’t cold and I was able to
breathe just fine. Before I knew it, I was standing on the moon. It was
amazing! It looked very different from the Earth. No trees, water, nor
houses. There wasn’t even any wind .
For each step I took I would bounce way up into the air. Every step
took left a huge footprint in the dust. I had to be careful and make sure
I didn’t jump into a crater because I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to get
out. Sometimes I couldn’t even see the bottom. I was bounding over to
something in the distance that looked very out of the place. When I got
there, I realized it was a flag. On the flag were the words: “To go to Earth,
close your eyes and think of what you’ve learned. You will find in no time at
all, you will be returned”. I wasn’t sure I wanted to go back just yet, but
I knew it might get dark soon and I didn’t want to be on the moon by
myself in the dark. I decided to close my eyes and think of the weather and
other characteristics of the moon I’d learned that day.
When I opened my eyes I was sitting on my seat in my Science
classroom. Miss Reyes was turning on the lights because the video was
over. I sat there wondering about what just happened. I opened my hand to
look at the metal disk, but it was gone! Did I really take a trip to the moon
or was it just a dream?

a. Saturn b. outer space c. a town d. a Science classroom
2. In the sentence, “ I was hovering in the air, way above the school” what

PedrocheMary Anne can dance, David thought, when one morning she illustrated their lesson in scansion with her expensive hands, and when she felt she could do it more effectively standing, she stood up and demonstrated the iambic pentameter with her long white arms waving in rhythm on one side and her well-rounded buttocks swaying softly as she moved across the room. It was perfect and lovely and I was entranced. I guess the whole class was.There was thing about Mary Anne. She did not know how to get sore if she did, she seldom showed it. She would smile at you whatever you would say. Or laugh her clean youthful laughter. One morning in class Mary Anne was teaching the students new words. Among these was the word presumptuous. Presumptuous, she said, means overbold, daring, audacious. Now, can anyone used the word properly in a sentence?I stood and said: Miss Ashborne, will it be presumptuous if I say you like a wingless angel?The room roared with laughter and I thought Mary Anne was going to blush or something and get really good and angry with me for my being presumptuous. But she did not. She laughed with the boys and said: David, you slay me!​</a>

This pain is produced by the dilation of a nerve center in the roof of your mouth. The nerve is overreacting to the cold by trying to heat your brain. Ice-cream headaches have turned many smiles to frowns. 2. I woke up late this morning because my alarm clock did ring.

I skip my meals and liquids, while I fight No breakfast, lunch, nor dinner at night: Eating was a burden, I tell my mind Cause a virtual gamer will never mind Then suddenly! On a clear daylight I felt something, I did not delight My hands are trembling, and little tummy burning! A crushing headache is very frightening My vision gets dimmer, A body thinner, weaker and cooler Help! Body organs are failing! I must do something or else I'll lose everything. I learned a lesson that every gamer must keep Inside your body are busy organs, even when you're asleep United in their functions, they work together as one Nourish your body organs and you will be a tough one Love your body, for you only have one; Be better, stronger, and smarter than ever.

Walking on the Moon
When I was in Grade 3, I got to take a trip to the moon. I remember
the day like it was yesterday. It was one of the strangest experiences I’d
ever had.
It all started when Miss Reyes, our Grade 3 Science teacher, was
showing a video about the different planets in the solar system. Halfway
through the video, I noticed a sparkling metal disc, about the size of a peso
18
PIVOT 4A CALABARZON
E
coin, lying on the floor. I kept trying to pay attention to the video, but found
myself bending over to pick up the shiny disk that was next to my desk.
As soon as I touched the metal disk, something strange happened.
I wasn’t in the classroom anymore. I was hovering in the air, way above
the school. I could see the whole or rather the rooftops of the whole city.
I was a little nervous, but also pretty excited. What was happening? How
could I be floating?
It was then when I remembered the metal disk I’d picked up from
the floor earlier. Did it I have something to do with the strange things that
were happening to me right now? I opened my palm and looked closely at
the disk. On the disk were these words:
“Floating through the air, like a helium filled balloon, your travels will
not stop, until you reach the moon”
The next thing I knew, I was soaring through space, dodging
satellites and asteroids. Oddly enough, I wasn’t cold and I was able to
breathe just fine. Before I knew it, I was standing on the moon. It was
amazing! It looked very different from the Earth. No trees, water, nor
houses. There wasn’t even any wind .
For each step I took I would bounce way up into the air. Every step
took left a huge footprint in the dust. I had to be careful and make sure
I didn’t jump into a crater because I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to get
out. Sometimes I couldn’t even see the bottom. I was bounding over to
something in the distance that looked very out of the place. When I got
there, I realized it was a flag. On the flag were the words: “To go to Earth,
close your eyes and think of what you’ve learned. You will find in no time at
all, you will be returned”. I wasn’t sure I wanted to go back just yet, but
I knew it might get dark soon and I didn’t want to be on the moon by
myself in the dark. I decided to close my eyes and think of the weather and
other characteristics of the moon I’d learned that day.
When I opened my eyes I was sitting on my seat in my Science
classroom. Miss Reyes was turning on the lights because the video was
over. I sat there wondering about what just happened. I opened my hand to
look at the metal disk, but it was gone! Did I really take a trip to the moon
or was it just a dream?

It was perfect and lovely and I was entranced. I guess the whole class was.There was thing about Mary Anne. She did not know how to get sore if she did, she seldom showed it. She would smile at you whatever you would say. Or laugh her clean youthful laughter. One morning in class Mary Anne was teaching the students new words. Among these was the word presumptuous. Presumptuous, she said, means overbold, daring, audacious. Now, can anyone used the word properly in a sentence?I stood and said: Miss Ashborne, will it be presumptuous if I say you like a wingless angel?The room roared with laughter and I thought Mary Anne was going to blush or something and get really good and angry with me for my being presumptuous. But she did not. She laughed with the boys and said: David, you slay me!​</h2><br />

That is when a painful sensation resonates in your head after eating something cold (usually ice cream) on a hot day. This pain is produced by the dilation of a nerve center in the roof of your mouth. The nerve is overreacting to the cold by trying to heat your brain. Ice-cream headaches have turned many smiles to frowns. 2. I woke up late this morning because my alarm clock did ring.
