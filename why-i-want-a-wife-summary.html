                        we need a wife, because we need someone who  care us  love us how much we love them in the future.<br />

                            2. i want the summary, how my brother brought home a wife.</h2><br />
                        <br />In the story, Leon arrived with his wife in the country meeting Leon's brother for the first time. They took a surprising route home for Leon, but it was meant as a test for the wife to see if she could endure thesacrifices she made and meet her new family.<br /><br />The entire story serves as a test for the wife. Each test was to show whether the woman could indeed live with strangers all for love. This can be a secondary theme, but more importantly, it is a theme in which the main character learns that though there are sacrifices it is worth it in the end.<br /><br />He even begins to think about getting himself a wife eventually. This helps to show the theme and how it developed. He notices through all the tests the woman though afraid will preserve through the trials in order to be happy with Leon at his home.<br /><br />The fact that the country is different from the city can be somewhat daunting the closer they get to the home, but she still manages to overcome and under come any trials.<br /><br />The wife admits to having some fear, but also shows clearly it did not stop her. This is why the theme is related to how one may have to give up some things in order to find happiness in life or at least the best happiness that can be found in that particular life.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        In the story, Leon arrived with his wife in the country meeting Leon's brother for the first time. They took a surprising route home for Leon, but it was meant as a test for the wife to see if she could endure the sacrifices she made and meet her new family.<br /><br />The entire story serves as a test for the wife. Each test was to show whether the woman could indeed live with strangers all for love. This can be a secondary theme, but more importantly, it is a theme in which the main character learns that though there are sacrifices it is worth it in the end.<br /><br />He even begins to think about getting himself a wife eventually. This helps to show the theme and how it developed. He notices through all the tests the woman though afraid will preserve through the trials in order to be happy with Leon at his home.<br /><br />The fact that the country is different from the city can be somewhat daunting the closer they get to the home, but she still manages to overcome and under come any trials.<br /><br />The wife admits to having some fear, but also shows clearly it did not stop her. This is why the theme is related to how one may have to give up some things in order to find happiness in life or at least the best happiness that can be found in that particular life. The trials just add to the picture being offered by the author.<br />
