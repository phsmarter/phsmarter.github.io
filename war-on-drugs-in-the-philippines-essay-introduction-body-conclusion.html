                            1. persuasive essay about War on drugs (introduction, body, conclusion)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The War on Drugs is a global campaign that aims to eliminate the use and distribution of illegal drugs. This campaign is being implemented in many countries around the world, including the United States. The goal of the War on Drugs is to reduce drug abuse and addiction rates, prevent drug-related crimes, and increase public safety. However, despite the efforts of governments, this campaign has been criticized for its negative effects on individuals, communities, and society as a whole. In this essay, I will argue that the War on Drugs is a flawed campaign that has failed to achieve its goals and has caused more harm than good.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>Firstly, the War on Drugs has failed to reduce drug use and addiction rates. Despite the billions of dollars spent on drug control and prevention programs, drug abuse and addiction rates continue to rise. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, approximately 19.3 million Americans aged 12 or older were current illicit drug users in 2020, representing 7.4% of the population. This suggests that the War on Drugs has been ineffective in addressing the root causes of drug abuse and addiction.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the War on Drugs has led to the criminalization and stigmatization of drug users, particularly those from marginalized communities. Instead of treating drug addiction as a public health issue, the War on Drugs has focused on punishing drug users and dealers, which has resulted in mass incarceration, police brutality, and human rights abuses. Moreover, drug laws are often enforced in a discriminatory manner, with people of color and low-income individuals being disproportionately targeted and penalized.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, the War on Drugs has fueled violence and corruption, particularly in countries where drug production and trafficking are prevalent. Drug cartels and organized crime groups have emerged as powerful forces, using violence and intimidation to maintain their dominance over the drug trade. This has not only caused harm to individuals and communities but also undermined the rule of law and democratic institutions.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, the War on Drugs is a failed campaign that has caused more harm than good. Its focus on punishment and prohibition has not only failed to reduce drug use and addiction rates but also led to the criminalization and stigmatization of drug users, violence, and corruption. Instead of continuing with the failed policies of the War on Drugs, governments should adopt evidence-based approaches that prioritize harm reduction, public health, and human rights. This includes investing in drug treatment and prevention programs, legalizing and regulating drugs, and addressing the social and economic factors that contribute to drug abuse and addiction.</p><br />

                            10. PATHOS ESSAYTOPIC:HAZINGINTRODUCTION:BODY:CONCLUSION: ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Hazing is a practice that has been around for decades, particularly in fraternities, sororities, and other social organizations. It involves subjecting new members to physical, emotional, or psychological abuse as a way of initiation. Although some may argue that hazing builds camaraderie and a sense of belonging, it often results in negative consequences that can have long-lasting effects.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>One of the main reasons why hazing is problematic is that it can have serious physical and emotional consequences. In extreme cases, hazing can lead to serious injuries, hospitalizations, and even death. Moreover, hazing can leave psychological scars on victims, leading to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Hazing can also create a culture of fear and intimidation, where victims are afraid to speak up or seek help.</p><p></p><p>Another issue with hazing is that it reinforces negative behaviors such as bullying, aggression, and violence. Hazing often involves humiliating, degrading, or physically abusing others, which can normalize such behavior and make it acceptable in certain social circles. This can perpetuate a cycle of abuse and violence that is harmful to individuals and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, hazing is a violation of human rights and goes against the principles of respect, dignity, and equality. No one should be subjected to physical, emotional, or psychological abuse as a way of gaining acceptance or membership in a group. Hazing undermines the values of fairness, justice, and democracy, and creates a toxic culture that is harmful to all involved.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, hazing is a harmful and destructive practice that should not be tolerated in any form. It perpetuates negative behaviors, reinforces a culture of fear and intimidation, and violates basic human rights. It is important for individuals, organizations, and society as a whole to recognize the dangers of hazing and work towards creating a culture of respect, inclusion, and acceptance. Hazing has no place in our communities, and we must all do our part to put an end to it.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>note: grabi yung sagot ko dito tapos 5 points lang haha sige</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Hazing is a practice that has been prevalent in many organizations, including fraternities, sororities, and sports teams. It involves subjecting new members to humiliating and often dangerous rituals as a way of proving their loyalty and commitment to the group. While hazing is often seen as a harmless tradition, it can have serious consequences for those who are subjected to it.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>Hazing can have a significant emotional and psychological impact on those who are subjected to it. Many victims of hazing experience feelings of shame, humiliation, and isolation, which can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. In extreme cases, hazing can even lead to suicide.</p><p></p><p>Hazing can also have physical consequences, as many hazing rituals involve dangerous or risky behaviors. Victims of hazing may be forced to consume excessive amounts of alcohol, endure physical abuse, or engage in other dangerous activities that can result in injury or death.</p><p></p><p>Despite the risks and negative consequences of hazing, many organizations continue to engage in this practice. This is often due to a culture of secrecy and a belief that hazing is necessary to maintain group cohesion and loyalty.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>Hazing is a harmful and dangerous practice that has no place in any organization. It can have serious emotional, psychological, and physical consequences for those who are subjected to it. It is important for organizations to take a stand against hazing and to promote a culture of respect, inclusivity, and safety. By doing so, we can create a world where hazing is no longer tolerated, and where all individuals are treated with dignity and respect.</p><p></p><br />

                        War On Drugs In Philippines<p>Philippines <strong>drug war</strong>, a battle is currently raging in the Philippines. A war against drugs is being fought, not one against another nation. The Philippines' current president, Rodrigo Duterte, has started a battle against drugs. Although harsh and ruthless, the campaign has been successful. Within the first six months of his campaign, Duterte claimed he would kill 100,000 drug users and traffickers. The government of the Philippines is fighting a drug war that is leaving thousands of people dead and instilling terror throughout the nation.</p><p> </p><p>Because they attribute drug misuse to a recent outbreak of crime, including rape, theft, and robbery, the government of the Philippines is waging a <strong>war on drugs</strong>. There have been around 1,900 drug-related deaths since Duterte started his war, 600 of which are still under investigation. Given that Duterte pledged to eliminate 100,000 drug users and dealers from the streets within six months of the start of his campaign, this is nothing.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, i draw the conclusion that, in addition to waging this <strong>war on drugs</strong>, there are many other things we can do to end all crime in our nation. This <strong>war on drugs</strong> has an impact on some innocent people who shouldn't be punished. In conclusion, it may be beneficial if the government's true goal is to get rid of all drug users and pushers. We could benefit from living in a secure nation free of crime.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Learn more about related topics by visiting the link below:</strong></p><p>brainly.ph/question/2162414</p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>Possessiveness is a natural human tendency that arises from the need for security, belongingness, and control. It is the desire to have and keep something or someone as one's own, often resulting in jealousy, insecurity, and control issues. While some degree of possessiveness can be healthy in a relationship, excessive possessiveness can be damaging and harmful. In this essay, we will discuss the effects of possessiveness, its impact on relationships, and ways to overcome it.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>Excessive possessiveness in a relationship can cause a significant impact on one's mental and emotional health. It can lead to feelings of jealousy, anger, and resentment, which can cause strain in the relationship. Possessiveness can also lead to controlling behavior, such as checking one's partner's phone or email, monitoring their whereabouts, and limiting their social interactions. This can result in feelings of isolation and loss of personal freedom, leading to low self-esteem and self-worth.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, possessiveness can affect not only the individual but also the relationship as a whole. It can create a toxic environment, causing stress, anxiety, and tension between partners. It can also lead to a lack of trust, which is a crucial element in any healthy relationship. Excessive possessiveness can lead to a breakdown in communication, which can ultimately result in the relationship's demise.</p><p></p><p>However, possessiveness can be overcome through various means. One way is to acknowledge and address the underlying issues that lead to possessiveness, such as insecurities or past experiences. It is essential to work on building self-confidence and trust in oneself and one's partner. It is also crucial to practice open and honest communication, which can help address any issues or concerns that may arise. Setting healthy boundaries and mutual respect can also help overcome possessiveness in a relationship.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>Possessiveness is a natural human tendency, but excessive possessiveness can be harmful to oneself and one's relationship. It can lead to feelings of jealousy, insecurity, and control issues, causing strain and tension between partners. However, by acknowledging and addressing the underlying issues, practicing healthy communication and building trust, possessiveness can be overcome. It is crucial to cultivate a healthy relationship based on mutual respect, trust, and understanding, which can lead to a more fulfilling and satisfying partnership.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction</p><p>Divorce is one of the most difficult life experiences a family can go through. It can have a profound impact on the emotional and psychological well-being of all members of the family. The disruption of family structure, roles, and relationships can cause long-term issues that can carry over into adulthood. While divorce does have its negative effects, it also presents an opportunity for families to learn and grow.</p><p></p><p>Body</p><p>Divorce can have a lasting impact on the mental health of those involved. Children in particular are vulnerable to the changes that come with family divorce. They can experience feelings of confusion, guilt, and anger as they cope with the changes to their family structure and dynamics. Studies have also found that children of divorced parents are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and poorer academic performance. In addition, children of divorce are more likely to struggle with relationships and trust issues as they get older.</p><p></p><p>Divorce can also have a significant financial impact on families. The costs associated with divorce can be significant, including legal fees, child support, and alimony. These costs can add up quickly and put a strain on the family’s finances. In addition, many families struggle to adjust to the new financial realities that come with divorce, such as having one less income and having to divide assets.</p><p></p><p>Despite all of the challenges that come with family divorce, there are also opportunities for growth and healing. Divorce can be a difficult but necessary step in order to create a healthier and happier family dynamic. It can be an opportunity to reevaluate family roles and relationships and to create more equitable and fulfilling dynamics. It can also be an opportunity to learn how to communicate more effectively and to develop better problem-solving skills.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Divorce is a difficult and emotional experience for all members of the family. It can have a lasting impact on emotional and financial well-being. However, it also presents an opportunity for families to learn and grow. With open communication and support, family members can use the experience of divorce to create a healthier and happier family dynamic.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Divorce is a process that not only severs the legal ties of marriage, but also dissolves the emotional and physical bonds. It is a decision that is often made after much deliberation and thought and is not one that should be taken lightly. While there are many reasons why a couple may choose to divorce, the decision is often based on a lack of communication and intimacy, unresolved conflict, and a general feeling of unhappiness.</p><p></p><p>The process of divorce can be difficult for both the couple and their children. It can be a time of great upheaval and change and can be emotionally and financially taxing. There are, however, steps that can be taken to make the process as smooth as possible. Couples should try to communicate openly and honestly with each other and work to resolve any outstanding conflicts. They should also seek the help of professionals, such as therapists or divorce attorneys, who can assist them in the process.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the decision to divorce is a personal one. It is a decision that should be made after careful consideration and should not be taken lightly. Divorce is a difficult process, but with the help of professionals, it can be a relatively smooth experience,</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Many families in the world have problems. Some of these problems are small, while others are much larger. However, no matter how serious it is, it can have an impact on the family. It's no secret that families can be a source of immense joy, but they can also be a source of significant stress and conflict. Family problems can take many forms, from financial stress to relationship difficulties. And while not every family will experience all these problems, most families will likely experience at least some of them at some point. That's why it's so helpful to talk about family problems. By talking about the issues we're facing, we can work together to find solutions and strengthen our families stronger. Not only that but talking about family problems can also help to reduce the stigma around them. Too often, people feel they have to keep their family problems to themselves, but this only makes things more difficult. We can help make it easier for others to do the same by talking about these issues. If you're facing family problems, know that you're not alone. And don't be afraid to reach out for help. There are many resources available for families who are struggling. With the support, you can get through anything.</p><p>One of the most common types of family problems is communication problems. Those with communication problems often have a hard time communicating with each other. Effective communication is essential to resolving family problems. It allows family members to express their feelings and needs safely and respectfully. It also allows for compromise and negotiation. Without communication, family members can quickly be resentful and frustrated, leading to even more problems. Communication is key. When communication breaks down, problems can quickly escalate and become unmanageable. Of course, communication is not always effortless. It requires effort and patience. Family members may not always be willing to listen or to compromise. But even in the most challenging situations, communication is still the most effective way to resolve problems.</p><p>Another common type of family problem is financial problems. Families who have financial problems often have a hard time making ends meet. This can lead to arguments and conflict. Financial issues can also make it difficult for family members to save money for future expenses.</p><p>Addiction is another common type of family problem. Those with addiction problems often have a hard time dealing with their addiction. This can lead to arguments and conflict. Addiction can also make it difficult for family members to get the help they need to recover from their addiction. If one or more family members are struggling with addiction, it can create a ripple effect on the entire family. Mental health problems can also be complicated for families to deal with. When a family member struggles with depression, anxiety, or another mental health issue, it can be challenging for the rest of the family to understand and support them.</p><p>Abuse is another common type of family problem. Families who have abuse problems have a hard time dealing with it. This can lead to arguments and conflict. Abuse can also make it difficult for family members to get the help they need to stop the abuse.</p><p>These are only a few examples of family problems. No family is flawless. Every family has difficulties, and some families have more problems than others.</p><p>In conclusion, family problems are a common occurrence that can happen to anyone. While they can be hard to deal with, there are several ways to overcome them. By communicating openly with family members, seeking outside support, and making a concerted effort to work through the issue, it is possible to resolve family problems.</p><br />

</p><p>Why Families are Important?
</p><p>Families are a blessing not everyone is fortunate enough to have. However, those who do, sometimes do not value this blessing. Some people spend time away from the family in order to become independent.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, they do not realize its importance. Families are essential as they help in our growth. They develop us into becoming a complete person with an individual identity. Moreover, they give us a sense of security and a safe environment to flourish in.</p><p></p><p>Pillars of Strength
</p><p>My family has been always by my side in ups and downs. They have taught me how to be a better person. My family consists of four siblings and my parents. We also have a pet dog that is no less than our family.
</p><p>
</p><p>Within each family member, lies my strength. My mother is my strength as I can always count on her when I need a shoulder to cry on. She believes in me more than any other person. She is the backbone of our family. My father is someone who will always hide away his troubles for the sake of his family.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>                       PERSUASIVE ESSAY</p><p>             Why Students Should Eat Breakfast Every Day</p><p>A lot of people, especially young people, go through the day without having breakfast.</p><p>Many people believe that it is not necessary, or they say that they don’t have time for</p><p>that, and begin their day with no meal. I believe that everyone should eat breakfast</p><p>before going to their activities. The purpose of this paper is to show the importance of</p><p>breakfast, especially for students. THESIS STATEMENT</p><p>The first reason why you should eat breakfast before going to school is for your</p><p>health. When you skip breakfast and go to school, you are looking for a disease because</p><p>it’s not healthy to have an empty stomach all day long. It’s very important to have a</p><p>meal and not let your stomach work empty. All you are going to get is gastritis and a lot</p><p>of problems with your health if you don’t eat breakfast.</p><p>Another reason for eating breakfast is because you need food for to do well in</p><p>your classes. You body and your brain are not going to function as good as they could</p><p>because you have no energy and no strength. When you try to learn something and have</p><p>nothing in your stomach, you are going to have a lot of trouble succeeding. A lot of</p><p>people think that they should not eat because they are going to feel tired, but that’s not</p><p>true. Breakfast is not a very big meal, and on the contrary, you’re going to feel tired if</p><p>you don’t have breakfast because you have spent the entire previous night without</p><p>food.</p><p>The last reason to have breakfast every day is because you can avoid diseases if</p><p>you eat some breakfast in the morning. If you don’t eat, you are going to get sick, and</p><p>these diseases will have a stronger effect on you because you’re going to get sick easier</p><p>than people who have breakfast every day.</p><p>You have to realize that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and you</p><p>cannot skip it without consequences for your health, your school and your defense</p><p>mechanism. It is better to wake up earlier and have a good breakfast that run to school without eating anything. It is time for you to do something for your health, and eating</p><p>breakfast is the better way to start your day.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
