Emotional Response:3.Tolerance of domestic violence is twice as high as in the rest of the developing world. Incidents of violence against civilians are on the rise. While this litany of suffering is true throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with regard to all these measures life is particularly harsh for people living in the roughly 34% of Africa where states have collapsed to the point of irrelevance. Emotional Response:4.Of the 20 countries in the world with the worst food and nutrition security, 19 are in Africa.Emotional Response:5.Although the poverty rate in Africa has dropped in recent years, rapid population growth means that the number of people suffering poverty keeps growing: from 280 million in 1990 to an estimated 330 million in 2012.Emotional Response:​</a>

                                            What to do: Read the key points in employing techniques in public speaking, then answer the activity that follows. Key PointsChances are that you'll sometimes have to speak in public as part of your role. While this can seem intimidating, the benefits of being able to speak well outweighs any perceived fears. To become a better speaker, use the following strategies:Plan appropriately.Practice. Engage with your audience. Pay attention to body language.Think positively.Cope with your nerves. • Watch recordings of your speeches.If you speak well in public, it can help you get a job or promotion, raise awareness for your team or organization, and educate others. The more you push yourself to speak in front of others, the better you'll become and the more confidence you'll have. Activity 5 You Can Speak! Directions: Fill in the blanks with public speaking technique. Choose your answer from the key points above. 1. You can improve your speaking skills dramatically by watching yourself later, and then working on improving in areas that didn't go well.2.Make an effort to stop thinking about yourself, your nervousness, and your fear. Instead, focus on your audience: what you're saying is "about them." Remember that you're trying to help or educate them in some way, and your message is more important than your fear. Concentrate on the audience's wants and needs, instead of your own. 3. Use affirmations and visualization to raise your confidence. This is especially important right before your speech or presentation. Visualize giving a successful presentation, and imagine how you'll feel once it's over and when you've made a positive difference for others. 4. Instead of standing behind a podium, walk around and use gestures to engage the audience. This movement and energy will also come through in your voice, making it more active and passionate. 5. This makes you feel less isolated as a speaker and keeps everyone involved with your message. 6. If you're going to be delivering a presentation or prepared speech, create it as early as possible. The earlier you put it together, the more time you'll have to practice. 7. Make sure that you plan your communication appropriately. Think about how you'll structure what you're going to say. Reflection: Answer briefly. Which of the public speaking technique/s do you still need to improve?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Education is not entirely the key to success and students need to know this way before they graduate. Parents, teachers and society should stop deceiving and destroying young people’s lives and future with their false claims of what education is.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>First, there should be clarity in the fact that being successful in life does not mean building houses, having many cars, huge amount of money in various bank accounts among others. Frankly speaking, that is the kind of success mostly perceived for us by our parents. We (I am directing this specifically to African Society) need to understand that success is relative. Being successful to me is maximizing your potential to the fullest and achieving set goals in life. And there is no way we can all have the same potential. If my aim is to become a fashion designer, being successful is becoming that fashion designer and even exceeding my boundaries as a fashion designer. All those luxuries automatically come with it.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The irony of all of this is, some people who were deemed for success will end up working for people who were considered failures. Like Bill Gates rightly put it ‘I failed in some subjects in exam, but my friend passed in all. Now, he is an engineer in Microsoft and I am the owner of Microsoft’. This is not to say that those who are academically gifted will end up working under those who aren’t but the point is, success is relative. Probably that engineer being referred to in this context wanted to be and he is but the problem will be if Bill Gates was judged based on failing some of his exams and his friend will be the successful one. Who would have had the last laugh?</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            14. What to do: Read the key points in employing techniques in public speaking, then answer the activity that follows. Key PointsChances are that you'll sometimes have to speak in public as part of your role. While this can seem intimidating, the benefits of being able to speak well outweighs any perceived fears. To become a better speaker, use the following strategies:Plan appropriately.Practice. Engage with your audience. Pay attention to body language.Think positively.Cope with your nerves. • Watch recordings of your speeches.If you speak well in public, it can help you get a job or promotion, raise awareness for your team or organization, and educate others. The more you push yourself to speak in front of others, the better you'll become and the more confidence you'll have. Activity 5 You Can Speak! Directions: Fill in the blanks with public speaking technique. Choose your answer from the key points above. 1. You can improve your speaking skills dramatically by watching yourself later, and then working on improving in areas that didn't go well.2.Make an effort to stop thinking about yourself, your nervousness, and your fear. Instead, focus on your audience: what you're saying is "about them." Remember that you're trying to help or educate them in some way, and your message is more important than your fear. Concentrate on the audience's wants and needs, instead of your own. 3. Use affirmations and visualization to raise your confidence. This is especially important right before your speech or presentation. Visualize giving a successful presentation, and imagine how you'll feel once it's over and when you've made a positive difference for others. 4. Instead of standing behind a podium, walk around and use gestures to engage the audience. This movement and energy will also come through in your voice, making it more active and passionate. 5. This makes you feel less isolated as a speaker and keeps everyone involved with your message. 6. If you're going to be delivering a presentation or prepared speech, create it as early as possible. The earlier you put it together, the more time you'll have to practice. 7. Make sure that you plan your communication appropriately. Think about how you'll structure what you're going to say.
