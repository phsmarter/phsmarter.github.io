By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text? Why or why not?4. List or underline each hedging expression used in the text.</a>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>It was a warm summer day when I first met my best friend, Sara. We were both in third grade and had just moved to the same town. We bonded over our love for horses and spent countless afternoons pretending to ride them in her backyard. We even convinced her mom to let us take riding lessons together, which quickly became the highlight of our week.</p><p></p><p>But as we got older, things started to change. We both became interested in different activities and started to drift apart. By the time we reached high school, we were hardly speaking anymore. I remember feeling a deep sadness about losing my friend, but I wasn't sure how to bridge the gap that had formed between us.</p><p></p><p>Years went by, and I moved away for college. But every time I came back to visit my hometown, I would think about Sara and wonder what had happened to her. It wasn't until social media became popular that I was finally able to reconnect with her. We messaged back and forth for a while, catching up on each other's lives and reminiscing about our childhood.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, we decided to meet up in person. I was nervous about seeing her again after so many years, but as soon as we hugged each other, it was like no time had passed at all. We spent the day doing some of our favorite childhood activities, like visiting the local petting zoo and riding horses at a nearby stable. It felt like we were kids again, and it was the best feeling in the world.</p><p></p><p>Now, Sara and I make an effort to stay in touch. We still live in different parts of the country, but we talk on the phone regularly and try to visit each other as often as we can. I'm so grateful to have her back in my life, and I often think about how much I wish we had never drifted apart.</p><p></p><p>If I had to describe Sara in detail, I would say that she is one of the most caring and compassionate people I have ever met. She has a great sense of humor and is always willing to lend an ear when someone needs to talk. I admire her strength and resilience, and I feel lucky to call her my friend.</p><p></p><p>Reflecting on my relationship with Sara, I realize that sometimes life gets in the way of maintaining close connections with the people we care about. But with a little effort and a lot of love, it's possible to rekindle those friendships and create new memories that will last a lifetime.</p><br />

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text? Why or why not?4. List or underline each hedging expression used in the text.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The main idea of the text is that many students struggle with reading comprehension despite mastering the mechanics of reading, but there are strategies that can help improve comprehension.</p><p></p><p>2. The text discusses how students often struggle with reading comprehension despite learning to decode words, and how the complexity of reading comprehension increases as students progress through school.

NARRATIVE TEXT Purpose: Essentially, the purpose of narrative text is to tell a story. That said, there can be many reasons for story telling in the first place, for example, myths can be told to explain natural phenomena and legends can be used to pass on cultural beliefs. Storytelling itself is a means to entertain and inform readers and allows for the writer to express themselves creatively and imaginatively. There are many types of narrative text, including myths, fables, traditional tales, novels, short stories etc. 2. EXPLANATORY TEXT Purpose: It moves beyond providing straightforward descriptions to looking at things like causes and reasons. They move beyond a retelling of what happened such as in a simple report, to address the why and how of what happened. 3. EXPOSITORY TEXT Purpose: It exists to provide facts in a way that is educational and purposeful.The text is fact-based with the purpose of exposing the truth through a reliable source. It focuses on educating its reader. Its purpose is not primarily to amuse, but to enlighten and instruct. The objective is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. 4. Factual/Personal Recount Purpose: Recounts focus on retelling events and are generally intended to inform and/or entertain. 5. Persuasive Text Purpose: Its purpose is to convince the reader of the merits of adopting a particular viewpoint or taking a specific course of action ​</h2><br />
