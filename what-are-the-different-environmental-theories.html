Which of the following best describes that occurrence of gene flow? A. It occurs even without migration. B. It occurs if an individual migrates from one population to another with no gene exchange. C. It occurs with or without migration. D. It occurs when migration allowed sharing of traits and exchange of genes to happen that may alter gene frequency. 4. The theory believes that nature selects the trait that will or will not survive and that organisms with favorable traits or those who are best suited in the environment have a better chance of survival. A. Mutation B. Gene Drift C. Natural Selection D. Non-random mating5. Those who survive will pass on their favorable traits to their offspring.

Adaptive Radiation D. Convergent Evolution 8. Why does adaptive radiation occur? A. Species adapts to ecological pressures from the other species. B. Species evolves into several different species, each occupying a new environment. C. Species change when there is a need to survive sudden or abrupt environmental changes. D. Species adapts to survive and evolve in a relative short time. 9. He proposed that organism evolve in response to their environment. A. Charles Darwin B. Gregor Mendel C. Jean Baptiste de Lamarch D. Alfred Russel Wallace 10. Who is the proponent of the Theory of Natural Selection? A. Charles Darwin B. Gregor Mendel D. Alfred Russel Wallace C. Jean Baptiste de Lamarck D. alfred russel wallace11. Jean Baptiste de Lamarck believed that giralles before have short necks, but because of their need to survive and in order to reach tall trees for food, they kept stretching their necks until these became longer and able to reach taller trees. A Theory of Needs C Theory of Evolution B. Theory of Use and Disuse D Theory of Acquired Clare 12. The theory of Lamarck which explained that if an organism acquired a body structure with long limbs, leg, or neck during its lifetime, it could be passed on to its offspring. What theory is this? A Theory of Need C. Theory of Use and Disuse B. Theory of Evolution D. Theory of Acquired Characteristics 13. Genetic drift is a change in the allele frequency of population due to A random chance C. artificial selection B. natural selection D. non-random mating 14. This mechanism of evolution occurs when populations migrate. A. Gene flow C. Genetic drift B. Speciation D. Natural Selection 15. Darwin's primary contribution to biological theory was the idea that: A. genes are the units of inheritance. B. new alleles arise through mutation. C. evolution is the change in gene frequencies over time. D. an important mechanism of biological evolution is natural selection.ANSWER: ————————————173 ❤ 5.0 ⭐1 a2 c3 d 4 a5 b6 b7 c8 d9 a10 a11 b12 c13 d14 b15 a​</a>

A person in China have homologous structures to a monkey found in Africa. C. Relatives of birds found in the Philippines were also found in Australia. D. Fossils of the Mesozoic era were found in layers of the Grand Canyon. 7. Which of the following observations best explains the evidence for artificial selection? A. Fossils of lizard-like reptiles were found in Asia, and Southern Africa. B. Birds of the same family were able to specialize dependent on their location. C. Different crops are grown at different climate-type countries. D. The fins, limbs, and wings of animals are similar in structure.  8. Crocodiles are among the few species of animals that have undergone minimal changes. Why is this so? A. They were already dispersed to begin with and thrived in all locations. B. They did not need a lot of evolutionary changes as they were always on top of the food chain. C. They had the genealogy of dinosaurs which were the perfect organisms. D. Crocodiles descended from alligators, gharials, and caimans. When Charles Darwin visited the island of Galapagos, he noted that there were several varieties of finches, each differing with beak shape and size. 9. What best explains this observation? A. The different types of finches all had different ancestors. B. The different types of finches have completely varying DNA sequences. C. These finches were domesticated to target specific food sources. D. The different types of beaks were due to specialization of what these finches ate.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This paper reviews vital behavioral and environmental theories that are capable of nurturing pro-environmental citizenry. Theories are developed to explain, predict, and enhance the understanding of phenomena. Theories challenge and extend the frontiers of knowledge within the boundaries of critical bounding assumptions. Theories vary in their development on the basis of the concepts and methods employed and empirical test undertaken. The testability of a theory is one of its essential feature. An integrative application of different behavioral and environmental theories could prove to be invaluable in solving contemporary environmental problems. The models and theories reviewed in this paper include; primitive models (behavioural change model, environmentally responsible behaviour model, reasoned/responsible action theory), planned behaviour theory, environmental citizenship model, model of human interaction with the environment, the value-belief-norm theory of environmentalism, health belief theory and diffusion of innovation model. This paper concludes that none of these theories can independently entirely explain human-environment interaction, but a combination of these theories will undoubtedly provide further insights and possible solutions to the increasing 21st century environmental problems posed by humans and her technology.</p><p></p><p>Keywords</p><p></p><p>Environmental Theory, Behavioral theory, Human-Environment interaction, Environmental preservation</p><p></p><p>Article Details</p><p></p><p>1. Introduction</p><p></p><p>For several centuries, the environment has provided habitation for humans and numerous organism but the insatiable needs of humans have driven them to devise strategies for survival and adaptation. Several of these strategies, especially technology, have had direct and indirect negative consequences on the immediate environment, resulting in the degradation of the latter. Many of today's environmental problems are increasingly the outcomes of individual actions, personal consumer decisions, and the activities of small and large businesses. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the healthiness of the world’s economy and people is inextricably bound to the wellbeing of the environment. This implies that now, much more than previously, there is a greater need to understand patterns, connections, systems and root causes of the degrading environment. A very strong tool for nipping the 21st century environmental problems, which are becoming lot more alarming in the bud, is environmental education. One veritable tool for achieving this feat is a proper understanding and the application of behavioural models and theories.</p><p></p><p>Theory is a well-established principle that has been developed to explain some aspect of the natural world. He stated further that theories arise from observations and testings that have been carried out repeatedly and they incorporate facts, predictions, laws, and tested assumptions that are widely accepted. The theoretical framework thus provides a platform for expressing a theory of a research study. It presents and describes the theory that explains why the research problem under study exists [1].</p><p></p><p>There is a close relationship between concepts and theories, such that, the constituents of a theory are concepts and principles. A concept is a symbolic depiction of an actual thing. It is the building block of the theory. The main difference between the theoretical and the conceptual framework is that a conceptual framework is the idea of the researcher on how the problem of the research will have to be explored. This is established on the theoretical framework, which lies on a much broader scale of resolution. The theoretical framework thrives that have been tested repeatedly over time that express the findings of numerous investigations on how phenomena occur. This framework provides a general representation of relationships between things in a given phenomenon. On its part, the conceptual framework describes the relationship between specific variables identified in the study. It furthermore outlines the input, process and output of an entire investigation [2]. A model is a blueprint for action, describing what happens in reality in a universal way. Models are used to describe the application of theories for a particular case. In a nutshell, theories are well-established principles developed to elucidate dimensions of the natural world, they are made up of concepts and applied by employing models.</p><br />

</p><p><strong>Behavior settings are theorized entities that help explain the relationship between individuals and the environment, especially the social environment, while Ecocriticism is an interdisciplinary study of literature and the environment, where literary scholars analyze texts that illustrate environmental issues and discuss the various ways in which literature deals with the nature.</strong>
</p>A false question about "different environmental theories discussed", which means different environmental theories, or that reminds us of environmental determinism, a theory to which it says that different cultural patterns and life models of human societies and their own biology derived from environmental conditions from where these people live.
Or environmental determinism allows us to assess, for example, the origins of physical differences between the various peoples, as well as their different cultures throughout the long history. Each region has climate, animals, distribution of natural wealth, etc. Isso would end up directly influencing the habits and culture in different parts of the world.
