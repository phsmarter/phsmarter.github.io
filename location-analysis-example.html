                                            ains Some very important tasks you do in school either face-to-face or distance learning requires writing compositions and presenting oral and written reports. In today's lesson, you will learn to organize information from secondary sources in preparation for writing. reporting and similar academic tasks in collaboration with others. A secondary source is a document or recording that gives information from a primary source. The original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format. Some examples are reference materials, nonfiction books, biographies, nonprint materials, almanacs, atlases and gazetteers, specialized references, CD-ROM references. periodicals, encyclopedias, video references and electronic databases. Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis, interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. Using primary source or secondary source helps you gather information. On the other hand, organizing information needs thorough reading, gathering information, validating the facts, and writing comprehensively. You may use the following ideas in organizing information from the secondary sources: Location-you can organize information by showing visual depiction of a physical space. You may use diagrams, analogues, graphic representations and maps to organize location. For example: Parts of the nervous system that may be presented using a diagram. Alphabet-some information is easy to organize using specific terms in alphabetical order like in dictionaries and index (at the back of a textbook). Time-another important factor in organizing information is the time element like history of humanity or events happened in a person's life journey. You may use fish bone, timeline, steps and cycle graphic organizers. Category-the use of category in presenting information is different from time. This type is used to group similar characteristics such as color, size, usage, brand, texture, materials, gender, age, model, price, content and nature. For example: Types of vehicles that may be written and presented according to usage, brand name, model and price, Hierarchy-hierarchies are used to indicate the ranks as to heaviest to lightest, smallest to biggest. For example: Rank of population in Lucena City. This is showing how one piece of information is connected to another broader information that you like to emphasize in your written and oral reports Answer the following questions: 1. What are the secondary sources of information? 2. What different ideas can you use in organizing information from secondary sources? 3. How are these ideas helpful in organizing information? mustions that​</a>

                        <p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>Jack London's short story "The Law of Life" was published in 1901 and has since been considered a masterpiece of naturalism literature. The story is set in Yukon, a remote land where the winter is long and harsh. The story centers around an old man named Koskoosh, who is left to die in the snow by his tribe due to a tribal law. Throughout the story, London uses vivid imagery to show the harshness of the natural world and the inevitability of death.</p><p></p><p>Summary:</p><p></p><p>"The Law of Life" tells the story of an old man named Koskoosh, who is abandoned by his tribe in the snow to die. The tribe's law is that anyone who is no longer able to contribute to the tribe should be left to die. Koskoosh is left alone in the snow and must come to terms with his inevitable death. The story shows Koskoosh's final moments and his reflection on his long life.</p><p></p><p>Personal Reflection:</p><p></p><p>Reading "The Law of Life" gave me a new perspective on the inevitability of death. The story shows how the natural world can be harsh and unforgiving, and how death is a part of life. It also highlights the importance of community and the role of the tribe in determining the fate of an individual. As someone who lives in a society where the individual is valued above all else, it was interesting to see the role of the tribe in a different culture.</p><p></p><p>Critical Analysis:</p><p></p><p>Jack London's use of vivid imagery in "The Law of Life" helps to create a sense of the harshness of the natural world. The story also explores themes of life and death, and the importance of community. Additionally, it raises questions about the morality of abandoning the old and the weak. While the story is set in a different time and culture, its themes are universal and relevant to contemporary society.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, "The Law of Life" is a powerful short story that explores themes of life and death, community, and morality. London's vivid imagery and well-crafted characters help to create a memorable reading experience. The story prompts the reader to reflect on the inevitability of death and the role of community in determining an individual's fate. Overall, "The Law of Life" is a classic work of naturalism literature that continues to resonate with readers today.</p><br />

Ang posibilidad ay ang pag-iisip kung ano ang maaaring kalabasan ng isang bagay na pinagpipilian, ginawa, o napanood. Hindi naman sa lahat ng pagkakataon ay lahat ng resulta ating isasagawa ay aayon sa ating kagustuhan, hindi ba?</p><p></p><p>         Ngunit, kung ito'y ibabase natin sa aking mga napag-aralan, may mga paraan tayo upang hanapin o mabatid ang tsansa o probability ng isang event. Halimbawa na ang LOTTO, na sa bawat numero ay hahanapin muna natin ang tsansa makuha o mapili ang mga ito. Kung tutuusin ay napakababa ng tsansang mapili ang lahat ng numerong ginuhitan mo, ngunit hindi ito imposible. Nasa sa iyo na lamang kung ipagpapatuloy mo ito. Isipin natin na sa bawat numerong itataya natin ay mayroon lamang 6 out of 55 na pagkakataong mapili ito. Sabi nga, sa loob ng 34,787,610 na tumaya sa 6/55 LOTTO, isa lamang ang nagwagi o swinerte. Kaya kung opinyon ko ang tatanungin, mas mabuti na lamang kung sa ibang bagay nalang pag-ipunan o ipagbili ang perang itataya sa mga ganitong uri ng sugal.</p><br />

                            20. ains Some very important tasks you do in school either face-to-face or distance learning requires writing compositions and presenting oral and written reports. In today's lesson, you will learn to organize information from secondary sources in preparation for writing. reporting and similar academic tasks in collaboration with others. A secondary source is a document or recording that gives information from a primary source. The original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format. Some examples are reference materials, nonfiction books, biographies, nonprint materials, almanacs, atlases and gazetteers, specialized references, CD-ROM references. periodicals, encyclopedias, video references and electronic databases. Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis, interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. Using primary source or secondary source helps you gather information. On the other hand, organizing information needs thorough reading, gathering information, validating the facts, and writing comprehensively. You may use the following ideas in organizing information from the secondary sources: Location-you can organize information by showing visual depiction of a physical space. You may use diagrams, analogues, graphic representations and maps to organize location. For example: Parts of the nervous system that may be presented using a diagram. Alphabet-some information is easy to organize using specific terms in alphabetical order like in dictionaries and index (at the back of a textbook). Time-another important factor in organizing information is the time element like history of humanity or events happened in a person's life journey. You may use fish bone, timeline, steps and cycle graphic organizers. Category-the use of category in presenting information is different from time. This type is used to group similar characteristics such as color, size, usage, brand, texture, materials, gender, age, model, price, content and nature. For example: Types of vehicles that may be written and presented according to usage, brand name, model and price, Hierarchy-hierarchies are used to indicate the ranks as to heaviest to lightest, smallest to biggest. For example: Rank of population in Lucena City. This is showing how one piece of information is connected to another broader information that you like to emphasize in your written and oral reports Answer the following questions: 1. What are the secondary sources of information? 2. What different ideas can you use in organizing information from secondary sources? 3. How are these ideas helpful in organizing information? mustions that​</h2><br />

But the clues must be placed in the right order for the story to make sense is how old a particular event or object is in comparison to other events or objects. Many things in your life are presumably relative ages that you are aware of. For instance, even if you don't know a friend's brothers' actual ages, you can infer their relative ages from the fact that she has an older and younger brother.</p><p></p><p>Information about the relative ages of things that have happened on Earth is preserved in <strong>sedimentary rock layers.</strong> As you already read, sediments that settle at the bottom of lakes, rivers, and seas give rise to sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks are created by the accumulation of sediment over time. Because it forms earliest, the lowest layer of rock is the oldest. The layer on top is the youngest of all, and each layer above that is younger.</p><p></p><p>However, over millions of years, rock layers can be disturbed by tectonic plate movement. Layers can be flipped entirely on their side. Like taco shells that start out as flat tortillas, rock layers can bend or even fold over. The youngest layer may not be visible at the top of a group of rock strata that has been disturbed. By contrasting the disturbed rock layers with an equivalent stack of undisturbed strata, scientists can ascertain the <strong>original order.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about rock types here: https://brainly.ph/question/7453730</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
