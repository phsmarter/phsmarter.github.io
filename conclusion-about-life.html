                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The absolute value function is commonly used to measure distances between points. Applied problems, such as ranges of possible values, can also be solved using the absolute value function. The graph of the absolute value function resembles a letter V. It has a corner point at which the graph changes direction.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A real life example for the absolute value function is a football field. Even though the center of the field is labeled zero, you wouldn't say you ran negative absolute value just means to make a number positive. if the number is already positive then absolute value does nothing. </p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p>HOPE IT HELPS CARRY ON LEARNING PAKIBRAINLIEST AT PAKIFOLLOW NALANG PO STAY SAFE GUYS ❤️❤️❤️.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Drawing conclusions is using information that is implied or inferred to make meaning out of what is not clearly stated. Writers give readers hints or clues that help them read between the lines, since not everything is explicitly stated or spelled out all the time. If that were the case in books and in real life, then the coffee shop conversation would've resulted in the woman saying exactly how annoyed she was rather than simply saying the word 'fine' in a suggestive manner.</p><br />

                            5. based on the poem you read what conclusion can you give about life?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Writers often tell you more than they say directly.  They give you hints or clues that help you "read between the lines."  Using these clues to give you a deeper understanding of your reading is called inferring. When you infer, you go beyond the surface details to see other meanings that the details suggest or imply (not stated).  When the meanings of words are not stated clearly in the context of the text, they may be implied – that is, suggested or hinted at.  When meanings are implied, you may infer them.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>The year 2020 started with a lot of hope and dreams for everyone. But little did we know that a pandemic was lurking around the corner, ready to turn our lives upside down. That pandemic was COVID-19, and it would change the world forever. In this book, I will share my personal experience of how COVID-19 affected my life, my community, and the world at large.</p><p></p><p>My Effect:</p><p></p><p>I am a working individual who had to adjust to the new normal of remote work. It was challenging at first, but I eventually learned to embrace it. As the pandemic progressed, I became increasingly worried for my family and friends' health risks.</p><p></p><p>Living in a pandemic was a surreal experience because the world has not witnessed such events in decades. COVID-19 was like an invisible enemy that put everyone on high alert. In my community, I witnessed the impact of COVID-19 firsthand. Shops, restaurants, and other businesses shut down left and right, leaving many people unemployed. I saw people scrambling for resources, such as food and water, in the early days of the pandemic, which was very disheartening.</p><p></p><p>Discussion:</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 was a global phenomenon that had affected everyone, regardless of race, gender, or social class. The world's economies and healthcare systems were pushed to their limits, with many countries struggling to provide support to the sick and the affected.</p><p></p><p>The way that the world handled the pandemic varied greatly between countries. Some took the virus seriously and enforced strict lockdowns, while others ignored the threat. Although vaccines are now available, the virus has yet to be eradicated.</p><p></p><p>The pandemic had cruel consequences, bringing up issues of inequalities and disparities. It had deepened social fractures, and people from different walks of life have been affected differently.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>COVID-19 may have changed the world forever, but it has also challenged us to be better. It pushed us to focus on the most important things in life: family, friends, and community. It also taught us the value of taking care of our mental and physical health.</p><p></p><p>The pandemic showed just how unprepared the world was to handle a crisis of this scale and highlighted the crucial role of science in preventing such crises from happening again. One of its silver linings is the unprecedented research and scientific progress achieved in a very short time.</p><p></p><p>Although the pandemic may be far from over, it is clear that it has left an indelible mark on the world. We will never forget the challenges and sacrifices of our healthcare workers and essential workers during this time. We can only hope that the world will learn from this experience and be better prepared for the next crisis that comes our way.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>"Pa, Brainliest po.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Earth and the resources of earth make life possible on it. If we were to imagine our lives without these resources, that would not be possible. As life cannot function without sunshine, air, vegetation, and water. However, this is soon going to be our reality if we do not save the earth now.</p><p>Essay on Save Earth</p><p>The resources earth provides us with are limited. They are blessings which we do not count. Human has become selfish and is utilizing the earth’s resources at a rapid rate. We need to protect them in order to protect our lives. This is so because man and all living organisms depend on the earth for their survival.</p><p>It is The Need of the Hour</p><p>To say that saving the earth is the need of the hour would be an understatement. All the activities of humans driven by greed and selfishness have caused immense damage to the earth. It is degraded it beyond repair. Almost all the natural resources are now polluted due to these activities.</p><p>When all these resources will be under threat, naturally lives of all living organisms will be under peril. This is why we need to save the earth at all costs. All the other issues are secondary and saving the earth is the main concern. For when the earth will not remain, the other issues will go away automatically.</p><p>Earth is the only planet which can sustain life on it. We do not have a planet B which we can move onto. This makes it all the more serious to save the earth and save our lives.</p><br />

                        <p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Life is something that requires a considerable amount of physical and mental effort. Some are fortunate enough to have everything prepared for them.  Such as some are born into money; some come across good fortune yet most work hard from the start to get some where in the world. It just all depends on how you were brought into this world. For some people, life is full of stress and hardships. That’s how life was for someone very dear to me. He had it difficult from the start. However he chose not to let life get him down. When life gave him lemons, he made lemonade. From the day that high school started, he had to work to support his seven siblings and his mother. Along with his father he worked hard to support his family.</p><p><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p><strong>sana </strong><strong>po </strong><strong>maka </strong><strong>tolung:</strong><strong>)</strong></p><br />

The following day, she was baptized as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu.</p><p>Mother Teresa’s parents, Nikola and Dranafile Bojaxhiu, were of Albanian descent; her father was an entrepreneur who worked as a construction contractor and a trader of medicines and other goods. The Bojaxhius were a devoutly Catholic family, and Nikola was deeply involved in the local church as well as in city politics as a vocal proponent of Albanian independence.</p><p>In 1919, when Mother Teresa — then Agnes — was only eight years old, her father suddenly fell ill and died. While the cause of his death remains unknown, many have speculated that political enemies poisoned him.</p><p>In the aftermath of her father's death, Agnes became extraordinarily close to her mother, a pious and compassionate woman who instilled in her daughter a deep commitment to charity. Although by no means wealthy, Drana Bojaxhiu extended an open invitation to the city's destitute to dine with her family. "My child, never eat a single mouthful unless you are sharing it with others," she counseled her daughter. When Agnes asked who the people eating with them were, her mother uniformly responded, "Some of them are our relations, but all of them are our people."</p><p></p><p></p><p>here for more info: https://www.biography.com/religious-figure/mother-teresa</p><br />

                        <p>Short Essay <strong>My Life in Pandemic</strong></p><p>COVID-19 has a cost. Many lost jobs, homes, and lives due to this pandemic. The infection affected my mood. For three months, I was scared and annoyed by how this virus was treated. I thought this virus might infect my family. I was told to practice personal hygiene and social distancing each time I brought it up. During the summer, I worked on my mental health. Before I got home from school, I was anxious. I wanted to eliminate my panic after realizing how anxious I was.</p><p>So I did group therapy. I attended a few programs. They all focused on anxiety and how to deal with it. Three months ago, I created a new connection with my anxiety. This tool helped me spot early indicators of a panic attack. Our group therapist offered us techniques to use when anxious. I am grateful for the result because I was patient with myself and did my homework to practice imageries and ten connected breaths. There are other ways to combat panic attacks, but they worked for me.</p><p>Being home all summer made me work out more. During my first year, I scarcely exercised, damaging my mood. I stay healthy and positive by exercising regularly. Besides being happier, I was in better shape. The Pandemic put me in lockup for a month. I chose to work out at home to stay healthy without a gym. My body transformed after so much exercise, and I'm glad.</p><p>In the previous month, the pandemic impacted my family hard. Financially and emotionally, my family suffered. I have a compassionate and generous family who will aid anyone in need. It's hard to witness loved ones struggle mentally and emotionally. Pandemics exacerbate anxiety and despair. Though it hurts to watch my family in trouble, I attempt to help. I've learned that having someone to listen to and console you is a blessing. Throughout the summer, I've learned to find the brightness even in gloomy moments.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about another short essay:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/2721738</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>THE Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC), through its social arm the Felix Y. Manalo Foundation, inaugurated on November 8 its housing and livelihood project for Kabihug families in Barangay Bakal, Paracale, Camarines Norte.</p><p></p><p>regions01a-111715</p><p>INC Executive Minister Eduardo V. Manalo led the inauguration, which coincided with the first worship service of the INC local congregation of Bakal and the dedication of its new house of worship which crowns the whole community.</p><p></p><p>The newly opened INC community project stands on a 100-hectare land on the slopes of Paracale. It contains 300 houses to serve as permanent shelters for Kabihug families. It also consists of livelihood facilities such as a 20-hectare calamansi orchard, an eco-farm and a 300-square-meter fish-drying plant. Beside the house of worship were a garment factory which has an initial 10 sewing machines and a learning center that will initially offer kindergarten and Grade 1 elementary courses to Kabihug children.</p><p></p><p>The Kabihug are an indigenous group belonging to the Negrito race from the highlands of the Bicol province.
