                        : Teaching Sign Language in the Philippines ꒱꒱ ̣ ̟<p></p><p>      Learning a different language to some may seem only for leisure or self-fulfillment purposes. However, for our hearing-impaired Filipinos, this "different language" could be the only language they would ever get to learn. Hence, a proposal has been brought up to the table - teach Sign Language Education in Philippine schools.</p><p></p><p>      Roughly 1.23% of the entire Philippine population is deaf, mute, or hearing-impaired. The calculated deaf population as of 2009 already stands at 241,624 for those who are totally deaf; and 275,912 for those who are partially deaf. That means that over 517,000 Filipinos have only little to no options to communicate because of their physical inabilities- this is where Sign Language Education comes in. Though there are many schools in the Philippines specifically designed to learn sign language, there are not many traditional schools that include sign language in their curriculums.</p><p></p><p>      Learning a different language to some may seem only for leisure or self-fulfillment purposes. However, for our hearing-impaired Filipinos, this "different language" could be the only language they would ever get to learn. But before we get into anything else, let's discuss what sign language is. Lina Martinez said that sign languages originate from visual units and that there are over a hundred sign languages currently recognized worldwide. But a study done at Gallaudet University discovered that ASL (American Sign Language) ranks as the third most used language in the United States. Yet ASL is still not being taught in American schools. Likewise, most of our countrymen do not even know that FSL (Filipino Sign Language) exists.</p><p></p><p>      Learning Sign Language would allow one to be more aware and sensitive towards the deaf and hard of hearing community. One must realize the value and significance of being able to understand this form of language holds. Because of these few reasons, The Implementation of  Sign Language Education in Philippine Schools can be deemed appropriate and incremental as a research topic. Furthermore, this research will show the country an opportunity to progress and develop as a whole. We must recognize the needs of the deaf and mute people to help reshape a world that was not inclined to privilege them.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>(The first paragraph is the introduction; the second and third are the body; the last is the conclusion.)</p><p></p><p>—————————— /ᐠ｡ꞈ｡ᐟ\ ——————————</p><p>  <strong>     Click the links below to read more!</strong></p><p>brainly.ph/question/2898577</p><p>brainly.ph/question/6941338</p><p></p><p>#BrainliestBunch ଘ(੭ˊᵕˋ)੭* ੈ✩‧₊˚</p><p>꒰⚘݄꒱₊ kt</p><br />

                        <p>The United States and the Philippines have a strong trade and investment relationship, with over $27 billion in goods and services traded (2086). The United States is one of the largest foreign investors in the Philippines, and is the Philippines' third-largest trading partner. The United States and the Philippines are treaty allies under the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1951. The Philippines is the oldest security ally of the US in Southeast Asia and one of the five treaty allies of the US in the Pacific region. The relationship between the United States and the Philippines has historically been strong and has been described as a special relationship. The Philippines is one of the oldest Asian partners of the United States and a strategically major non-NATO ally.</p><p></p><p>4 Main Reasons Why Filipinos Speak English So Well. First and most important reason: The American influence on the education system. They introduced a free education system and even sent teachers from America to help spread the language and made all teachers speak English in school. Philippine English is a legitimate nativized variety of English. While it shares some of the linguistic properties ascribed to other varieties of English, especially those used in Asia, it has features that are unique to it.</p><p></p><p>Enhancing the teaching of English in the Philippines presents opportunities for the country in the area of tourism. Rosario Alonzo, Dean of the University of the Philippines College of Education, says that the College ensures this by emphasizing to its students that English is a skill to be used for communication. Education became a very important issue for the United States colonial government, since it allowed it to spread their cultural values, particularly the English language, to the Filipino people. Instruction in English language, and American history, lead to forming of a national identity and Filipino nationalism.</p><p></p><p>From Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English strong accent the way that someone pronounces words that shows clearly that they come from a particular area or country a strong German accent → strongExamples from the Corpusstrong accent • Not merely that, I was putting my strongest accent on the syllable that wasn't! A dialect is generally a particular form of a language which is specific to a region or social group and usually has differences in pronunciation, grammar, syntax and vocabulary. It's still a bit fuzzy to understand because dialects can be spoken by people living in one particular town or by a whole nation. English is the most influential in the world by far, making one of the most important languages.</p><p></p><p>English is very important in the Philippines and it is the international language all over the world. At present English is the most useful language in the Philippines. From the education, industries, business, employment, and everyday life of Filipino it is very common to speak English to people.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

The population growth rate, which has been 2% in this century, is declining in most regions of the Philippines. The 1980 census showed a decline in the proportion of the population under 15 uears old. The size of the working-age population and the aged rose slightly. The median age in 1980 was 18.6 years as opposed to 16.9 years in 1970. Men still outnumber women in the Philippines. Urbanization has increased by 10% from 1948 to 1980, a relatively sluggish urban growth rate. In 1960, the total fertility rate was 6.5; this declined to 5.2 in 1975. The regions that are most exposed to modernization have the lowest fertility. Philippine surveys show that urban population (especially metro Manilans), the college educated, and those married to white collar workers have the smallest family size. Age at marriage also influences fertility. Mortality has declined continuously during the 20th century, and especially from 1968-1980. The 1980 census shows a higher population growth rate than expected. This makes replacement level fertility unlikely by the end of the century. Projections demonstrate that the population size of the country will be at least 71 million and perhaps as much as 80 million by the end of the century. These population figures highlight the following development issues: 1) an increasing number of jobs for the growing numbers of people in the working ages, 15-64; 2) lower productivity due to large numbers of young inexperienced workers; 3) larger numbers of retired people in relation to workers; 4) an imbalance in educational opportunities and health care between rural and urban areas; 5) the inability of the family planning program to reach high fertility sub-groups; 6) the need for rural development programs; and 7) the increasing interrelationship between demographic and development trends.</p><p></p><p><strong>c</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>g</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>©</strong></p><p><strong>/</strong>hope to help</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>i gotcha here's the answer hope it helps :&gt;<br /><br />One important event in the history of the Philippines is the Philippine Revolution of 1896, which led to the country's independence from Spanish colonial rule. This revolution was sparked by the discovery of the Katipunan, a secret society that aimed to overthrow Spanish rule and establish an independent Philippines.</p><p></p><p>The Philippine Revolution of 1896 involved various key figures, such as Andres Bonifacio, Emilio Aguinaldo, and Apolinario Mabini, among others. These individuals played significant roles in organizing and leading the revolutionary movement against Spanish colonialism.</p><p></p><p>It is important for Filipinos to know about this event because it marks a pivotal moment in the country's history. The Philippine Revolution of 1896 represents the courage and determination of Filipinos to fight for their freedom and sovereignty. It also highlights the sacrifices and struggles that the country had to endure to achieve its independence.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Philippine Revolution of 1896 serves as a reminder of the country's rich heritage and the importance of preserving it for future generations. By learning about this event, Filipinos can develop a deeper appreciation for their culture, history, and identity.</p><p></p><p>In terms of incorporating different types of news, discussing the Philippine Revolution of 1896 can include current events news as well. For example, the event's anniversary is celebrated every year on August 26, which can be considered as a soft news topic. Additionally, discussions on the continuing efforts to preserve and promote the country's heritage can be included as hard news topics, as these efforts involve government policies and initiatives.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the Philippine Revolution of 1896 is an important event in Philippine history that Filipinos should know about. By understanding and appreciating this event, Filipinos can develop a sense of pride in their cultural heritage and a stronger sense of national identity.</p><br />
