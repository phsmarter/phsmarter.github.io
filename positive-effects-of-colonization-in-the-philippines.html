                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Colonial powers introduced Western schools and healthcare, resources that often had a positive effect on the lives of the colonized people. Government schools typically focused on training for low-level civil service occupations. In many African colonies, missionaries shouldered much of the responsibility for educating the masses. Although fewer than half of the children in most colonies went to school, many of the leaders of national liberation movements who went on to lead post-colonial governments had been educated in colonial government and missionary schools. Where colonizers established medical centers, they succeeded in lowering infant mortality and promoted vaccination and disease prevention. While the colonizers did bring positive improvements and advancements, the inhabitants often lacked immunity to the pathogens the colonizers also brought from their home countries. Indigenous populations fell to plagues including smallpox, influenza and other viruses that hadn't existed within their county prior to colonization.
</p><p>
</p><p>Political Strife
</p><p>In many territories, colonizing powers created centralized governments where none existed before. The colonizers, however, created political borders that served their own needs rather than reflecting the historical territorial divisions of the people who lived there. Suddenly, many ethnic groups that had never worked together were forced to do so. At the same time, some groups found their traditional territory divided by a political border between two colonial countries, fracturing ties between extended family and kinsmen. As a result, colonialism created large, ethnically fragmented countries prone to civil wars both during and after the colonial era.
</p><p>
</p><p>Plantation Mentality
</p><p>Colonial powers conquered distant lands in part to exploit their natural resources, and exerted complete control of the extraction and export of cash crops and minerals -- often with little regard to helping the people native to the area. In agriculture-based colonies, a plantation economy developed, such as the coffee plantations of India and modern-day Sri Lanka. Plantation owners exerted strict control over the native people they hired to work there, often in deplorable conditions. In Southeast Asia, colonialism did have the positive effect of European investment and construction of canals and irrigation systems. African territories also saw roads and other infrastructure as a result of colonialism. However, such progress came at the expense of harsh treatment by the colonizers.
</p><p>
</p><p>Traditions Lost
</p><p>During the colonial era, many European colonizers, such as Great Britain, took a paternalistic view of the native culture. They saw themselves as acting in the best interests of these people, bringing them Christianity and civilization. This attitude destroyed traditional beliefs and social values, however, and had a negative effect on colonized populations. Some groups attempted to curry favor with the colonizers by converting to Christianity and renouncing their traditional beliefs. Converts often acquired special military positions or privileged tasks in colonial government administration. For example, the French preferred to employ Vietnamese clerks and government administrators in Cambodia and Laos. Over time, colonizers often came to prefer certain ethnic groups in a colony over others, reinforcing or even exacerbating ancient ethnic tensions.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:Maurice Tolentino, 1 Colonization is to build a colony that is under the control of a nation. But too bad our country was colonized by different nations. Nations that were too powerful to conquer our beautiful and rich islands from our benighted ancestors. The Philippines today is all but a product of its colonization in her adolescent years. The Republic of the Philippines, located in Southeast Asia, is built out of 7,107 islands and is separated in three main islands, namely, Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao1. Our ancestors or ninunos came from four different tribes. They are the Negritos, Indonesians, Aetas, and Malays. Together, they begun the “migration theory” of the Philippines.1 During the colonial period of the Philippines, the first nation that was attracted to colonize our islands was Spain. It was Ferdinand Magellan, an explorer of Europe who first discovered our beautiful archipelago in 1521, landing in Leyte Gulf2. On November 19 or 20, 1564 a Spanish expedition, of a mere 500 men led by Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, begun to set sail to our island and arrived in Cebu on February 13,1565. In 1570, Legaspi conquered the kingdom of Manila through dispatching Martin de Gotti to Luzon and finally made Manila the capital of the Philippines3. These men are those who sought our island to be their own colony by using power and advance tactics in ruling, managing, and governing. The Philippines was an attraction of colonization because of its rich resources, its magnificent archipelago, and its people’s hospitality to neighbouring countries. During the Spanish regime to our country, the church and the state was united. The governor-general had the power over the church and the friars played a major role in the government. The Archbishops were the most powerful in the church but however, the church showed more authority over the Filipinos than the government, which is why is why the Philippines’ government was also called, “Frairlocracia”, a government controlled by friars. One legacy that seemed to be the best of all legacies the Spanish brought to our country was Christianity of Catholicism. It made us the only Christian country in whole Asia today. But though its result today was a positive one, the beliefs of it brought thousands of death and tortures of the residents during the colonial period5. Maurice Tolentino, 2 The economy of the Philippines today is a produce of the foundations the Spanish brought to us in the branch of businesses or trades. The Manila-Acapulco was the main source of income for the colony during its early colonial years. The trades were too affluent that it unkempt the development of our local industries. The trades lasted for over two hundred years, and then ended in 1821. Our economy before and until now has one common thing, they are both reinforced by taxation and monopolies. In the educational system, Spanish priests headed the formal education and its centre is Christian doctrines5. Spanish education played a major role in the transformation of our country. They built the first universities, colleges, and vocational schools and assembled the first modern public education system in the Philippines6. Spain sure was a mighty nation to conquer our country. Though in history, hey have shown more cruelty and less humility, they still are a huge part of our country’s story just like the name “Philippines”. By 1898, the Philippines was primarily in the same struggle against the Spanish during the Spanish-American War and there, we the Filipinos found ourselves under the authority of the United States. Before the colonial period of the Americans to the Philippines, during the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Emilio Aguinaldo, the leader of the Philippine Revolution, made an alliance with the Americans to strive for the Philippines’ independence from Spain8. But then, when the Americans refused to commit to paper the statement of their support for Philippines’ independence, it became clear that the American were in the island to stay9. After the Spanish-American War, the Treaty of Paris was signed that declares that the Philippines was therefore under the authority of the United State after buying it from Spain with the cost of 20 million dollars10. From then on the United States’ War Department brought all the islands of the Philippines under military control for a reason that states that the Filipinos were too “uncivilized”. This brought a huge astonishment to the Filipinos because they expected the Americans to help them struggle for independence. But not only did they not help the Filipinos to struggle for independence, they refused to grant them freedom for forty-five years (1898-1946)10. Conflicts broke out on February 4, 1899 that sparked the Philippine-American War11.

The Spanish changed the life of the Filipino.  Even though the Spanish are not human but still the Filipino because the Spanish people have tried to enforce our country by sharing with us the way they live and those things that have contributed to us a lot of effort to enforce our country by sharing with us the way they live and those things in the Philippines.  
And we are also grateful in Spanish for converting the Philippines into Catholicism because if Spain did not succeed in colonizing our country, then our country would become a Muslim nation today.  Catholicism is the most important contribution that Spanish has given us. The Spanish colony in the Philippines has brought such poverty, violence, misery to us by the Philippines.  But it also contributes to us a lot of good things.  They improved and helped our country in many ways.  Even though the Filipinos experienced the injustice of the Swords but they still influenced us the way they lived and to this day we still use and do those influences in our daily lives.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
