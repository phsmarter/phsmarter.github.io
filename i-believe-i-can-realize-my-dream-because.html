In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</a>

1st Text:
Do you know where you can find some of the largest zoos in the world? One of them is the
Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, which can be found in Omaha, Nebraska. This zoo is
home to about 17,000 animals of 962 species. Its mission is conservation, research,
recreation, and education. It encompasses over 130 acres of land area. Some of its
attractions are the largest cat complex in North America, the world’s largest indoor swamp,
the world’s largest indoor desert, as well as the largest glazed geodesic dome in the world.
It’s no wonder why this zoo became Nebraska’s top paid attraction.
2nd Text:
If you plan to visit a zoo this coming holiday or on your day off, then you might want to
consider Manila Zoo. Going to the zoo is not a problem as it is near the national highway.
The standard fee is very cheap as you only have to pay 100 pesos, but if you happen to live
within Manila, you only have to pay half of it. If you easily get hungry or you will be bringing
children with you, there are cheap foods sold within the zoo. If you are fond of souvenirs,
there are also souvenirs shops near the entrance.
3rd Text:
I personally believe that we are not doing the animals any favor when we put them inside
the zoo. I don’t believe that protection is the main goal of every zoo as it has just been
reported recently that a certain tiger had a seizure because of poor nutrition. If that is
really true, then is it not right that we put these poor animals where they really belong?
These animals are being used by a group of people for gaining profit only. They pretend as
if they care, but in fact, they really don’t.
4th Text:
My dream was about to hit the climax when I felt my face was being burned. The sun
pierced through the window again. I slowly opened my eyes only to realize that I was
already late. Yes. It was already 6:30, and I was already 30 minutes late for the trip to the
zoo. I rushed to my cabinet and picked whatever clothes I could wear. I didn’t even bother
to take a bath and brush my teeth. I guess no one would dare to smell me inside the bus.
When I arrived at school, the gate was already closed and not a single student was there. I
bet they already left. So, I checked my phone to see what time it was already, then I saw the
date. It was February 9, a Saturday, but the field trip is still on Monday. I was never really
late. In fact, I was two days early.

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</h2><br />

1st Text:
Do you know where you can find some of the largest zoos in the world? One of them is the
Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, which can be found in Omaha, Nebraska. This zoo is
home to about 17,000 animals of 962 species. Its mission is conservation, research,
recreation, and education. It encompasses over 130 acres of land area. Some of its
attractions are the largest cat complex in North America, the world’s largest indoor swamp,
the world’s largest indoor desert, as well as the largest glazed geodesic dome in the world.
It’s no wonder why this zoo became Nebraska’s top paid attraction.
2nd Text:
If you plan to visit a zoo this coming holiday or on your day off, then you might want to
consider Manila Zoo. Going to the zoo is not a problem as it is near the national highway.
The standard fee is very cheap as you only have to pay 100 pesos, but if you happen to live
within Manila, you only have to pay half of it. If you easily get hungry or you will be bringing
children with you, there are cheap foods sold within the zoo. If you are fond of souvenirs,
there are also souvenirs shops near the entrance.
3rd Text:
I personally believe that we are not doing the animals any favor when we put them inside
the zoo. I don’t believe that protection is the main goal of every zoo as it has just been
reported recently that a certain tiger had a seizure because of poor nutrition. If that is
really true, then is it not right that we put these poor animals where they really belong?
These animals are being used by a group of people for gaining profit only. They pretend as
if they care, but in fact, they really don’t.
4th Text:
My dream was about to hit the climax when I felt my face was being burned. The sun
pierced through the window again. I slowly opened my eyes only to realize that I was
already late. Yes. It was already 6:30, and I was already 30 minutes late for the trip to the
zoo. I rushed to my cabinet and picked whatever clothes I could wear. I didn’t even bother
to take a bath and brush my teeth. I guess no one would dare to smell me inside the bus.
When I arrived at school, the gate was already closed and not a single student was there. I
bet they already left. So, I checked my phone to see what time it was already, then I saw the
date. It was February 9, a Saturday, but the field trip is still on Monday. I was never really
late. In fact, I was two days early.
