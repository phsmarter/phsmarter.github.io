Write your answers on the space provided below. The environment plays a significant role to support life on earth. But there are some issues that are causing damages to life and the ecosystem of the earth. It is related to the not only environment but with everyone that lives on the planet. There are hundreds of issue that causing damage to the environment. But in this, we are going to discuss the main causes of environmental issues because they are very dangerous to life and the ecosystem. Pollution – It is one of the main causes of an environmental issue because it poisons the air, water, soil, and noise. As we know that in the past few decades the numbers of industries have rapidly increased. Greenhouse Gases – These are the gases which are responsible for the increase in the temperature of the earth surface. Climate Changes – Due to environmental issue the climate is changing rapidly and things like smog, acid rains are getting common. Now we know the major issues which are causing damage to the environment. So, now we can discuss the ways by which we can save our environment. Here are some ways. Reforestation – It will not only help in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem but also help in restoring the natural cycles that work with it. The 3 R’s principle – For contributing to the environment one should have to use the 3 R’s principle that is Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Moreover, it helps the environment in a lot of ways. To conclude, we can say that humans are a major source of environmental issues. Likewise, our activities are the major reason that the level of harmful gases and pollutants have increased in the environment.

Mena Long time ago, there lived a couple named Mang Ben and Aling Linda in Barangay Santa Ana. They had two children and lived peacefully in a shanty near the river. Near their barangay, big and healthy bunches of water lily were seen. These caused the residents to suffer from flood especially when there is a heavy rain. 1. What is the title of the story? The couple thought of a way on how to reduce and control the rapid growth of these plants. They helped each other to gather the water lilies and put them first in a corner for drying. Mang Ben tried to weave a mat and his wife was amazed of what she saw. What is the main idea? "Oh, that's beautiful! Maybe you can make other things aside from this mat", said Aling Linda. So, Mang Ben created other things like bags, baskets, wallets, slippers and other products. They tried to sell the products and were easily sold to the community. The couple was very happy because they earned much. "Linda, help me make more products", Mang Ben said. From then on, making products out of water lilies became their source of living. It helped them a lot. They also shared their skills in making products to their neighbors who had no work. They never thought that water lilies which caused flood was a great help to the community. They were able to discover that it can be a primary source of income. They used indigenous material which is safe to the environment. With their new source of income from water lily products, the family had a better life. 2. Who are the authors of the story? What part of the story do you like best? Why?

                            10. Activity: MARCH 7, 2023 Directions: Based on the selection, enumerate the environmental problems and ways on how to minimize the environmental threats. Write your answers on the space provided below. The environment plays a significant role to support life on earth. But there are some issues that are causing damages to life and the ecosystem of the earth. It is related to the not only environment but with everyone that lives on the planet. There are hundreds of issue that causing damage to the environment. But in this, we are going to discuss the main causes of environmental issues because they are very dangerous to life and the ecosystem. Pollution – It is one of the main causes of an environmental issue because it poisons the air, water, soil, and noise. As we know that in the past few decades the numbers of industries have rapidly increased. Greenhouse Gases – These are the gases which are responsible for the increase in the temperature of the earth surface. Climate Changes – Due to environmental issue the climate is changing rapidly and things like smog, acid rains are getting common. Now we know the major issues which are causing damage to the environment. So, now we can discuss the ways by which we can save our environment. Here are some ways. Reforestation – It will not only help in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem but also help in restoring the natural cycles that work with it. The 3 R’s principle – For contributing to the environment one should have to use the 3 R’s principle that is Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Moreover, it helps the environment in a lot of ways. To conclude, we can say that humans are a major source of environmental issues. Likewise, our activities are the major reason that the level of harmful gases and pollutants have increased in the environment.

                            27. Directions: Read the story and answer the following questions. The Water lily Florence B. Ricardo John Dennis S. Mena Long time ago, there lived a couple named Mang Ben and Aling Linda in Barangay Santa Ana. They had two children and lived peacefully in a shanty near the river. Near their barangay, big and healthy bunches of water lily were seen. These caused the residents to suffer from flood especially when there is a heavy rain. 1. What is the title of the story? The couple thought of a way on how to reduce and control the rapid growth of these plants. They helped each other to gather the water lilies and put them first in a corner for drying. Mang Ben tried to weave a mat and his wife was amazed of what she saw. What is the main idea? "Oh, that's beautiful! Maybe you can make other things aside from this mat", said Aling Linda. So, Mang Ben created other things like bags, baskets, wallets, slippers and other products. They tried to sell the products and were easily sold to the community. The couple was very happy because they earned much. "Linda, help me make more products", Mang Ben said. From then on, making products out of water lilies became their source of living. It helped them a lot. They also shared their skills in making products to their neighbors who had no work. They never thought that water lilies which caused flood was a great help to the community. They were able to discover that it can be a primary source of income. They used indigenous material which is safe to the environment. With their new source of income from water lily products, the family had a better life. 2. Who are the authors of the story? What part of the story do you like best? Why?

It is a vast, complex system powered by two sources of energy an internal source (the decay of radioactive elements in the geosphere, which generates geothermal heat) and an external source (the solar radiation received from the Sun); the vast majority of the energy in the earth system comes from the Sun. _8. This is the process by which energy is transmitted through space, typically in the form of electromagnetic waves. 9. This is the physical movement of fluids (such as water or air) that contain energy in the form of heat; convection does not occur in solids. 10.
