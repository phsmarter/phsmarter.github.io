                                            health is wealth.there is nothing in our life that is more valuable than health. without health, there is no peace, no success and no happiness When we are ill, we do not want to work or play. Health robs us of good sleep and appetite. Life becomes a burden for a person who is sick all the time. He feels tired of life and always complains about something. But a person with good health enjoys his life. He never gets tired of work or play. He enjoys the beauty of the world and is happy with everything. He is able to work hard to make his dreams become a reality. He never complains and is always happy and cheerful. He may be poor, he may have to work hard to earn his living, but even the richest ma will envy him for his good health So, I believe that the saying, "Health is Wealth" is very true.1.

                            1. hard work vs smart work essay English ​</h2><br />
                        <p>In the modern world, ?hard work? And ?smart work? It is two terms commonly used to describe the approach to work. While both are considered valuable, they have clear differences and benefits. In this essay, we will explore the meaning of hard work and smart work, their differences, and the benefits of each.   Hard work refers to putting in a lot of effort and time to achieve a goal. It is often associated with perseverance and dedication, and it is widely believed that success comes through hard work. Those who subscribe to this philosophy believe that the only way to succeed is to work tirelessly and overcome any obstacles that come your way. This approach often involves working long hours, sacrificing personal time, and focusing solely on the task at hand.   On the other hand, smart work refers to an approach that aims to work efficiently and effectively to achieve the desired result. Instead of putting in long hours, intelligent employees prioritize their tasks and focus on the most important ones first. This approach often involves strategic planning, using resources effectively, and working with others to achieve the desired outcome. Smart employees often prioritize their work based on urgency and importance, and  use their time and  resources wisely to get the job done.   The main difference between hard work and smart work is the focus on effort versus efficiency. Hard workers focus on trying as hard as possible, while smart workers focus on working efficiently to get the best results. Hard work often means working more than necessary, while smart work means working smarter, not harder.   Both approaches have their advantages. Hard work can lead to a sense of accomplishment and personal satisfaction, and  can help people develop important skills like perseverance and determination. On the other hand, working smart  can help people achieve their goals faster and more  efficiently, which can help them  achieve  better work-life balance and maintain better mental health.   In summary, the choice between working hard  and working smart  ultimately comes down to individual goals and preferences. Those who prefer to work tirelessly and overcome obstacles may prefer hard work, while those who value efficiency and work-life balance may prefer working smart. Ultimately, both approaches can lead to success, and it is up to you to decide which one works best for you.</p><br />

Additional Activities
Directions: Read the conversation below where the remark by an employer could be
misinterpreted by an employee of a company. Write a ten-to-fifteen-sentence essay
explaining where the confusion could have originated. Why do you think the
employee misinterpreted the employer? What then is the importance of
understanding speech acts.
Employer: Are you doing anything?
Employee: I'm sorry. I will do something now.
Employer: No. what I mean is if you are not doing anything, then you
can go home and take a rest now. You have been working
too hard.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The employee must have thought that the employer was saying it in a mean way or bad way. Which explains why the employee responded that way. The employee seems to be scared to get fired of course. Who wouldn't be? However, the employee looks hardwoking. It was sweet when the Employer told him to just go home and rest. The employer probably observing him doing works the whole day that's why he told him that. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>kulang sa sentence medyo barado itak ko ngayondagdagan mo nalang,,, You're welcome </p><br />

Health robs us of good sleep and appetite. Life becomes a burden for a person who is sick all the time. He feels tired of life and always complains about something. But a person with good health enjoys his life. He never gets tired of work or play. He enjoys the beauty of the world and is happy with everything. He is able to work hard to make his dreams become a reality. He never complains and is always happy and cheerful. He may be poor, he may have to work hard to earn his living, but even the richest ma will envy him for his good health So, I believe that the saying, "Health is Wealth" is very true.1.
