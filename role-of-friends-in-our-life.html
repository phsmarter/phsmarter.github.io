I'm Kate. I want to write about my mobile phone. I got it from my parents for my birthday two years ago. I like it very much and I think it's sometimes good to have it in my bag. I always keep it in my bag or in my pocket so my parents and my friends can always call me. It's got a calculator in it so I sometimes use it at school. I can use my mobile phone to connect to the Internet and look through the news or read emails. Isn't it fantastic? Last year I was on a cycling holiday with my friend. We went cycling but the weather wasn't good. It was cold and windy. It started to rain and it got dark. Suddenly my friend fell off her bike and she broke her leg. At first I didn't know what to do but I thought about my phone. It was in my backpack so I called for help. After fifteen minutes a doctor arrived. Sometimes people are not used on exploring their mobile phones which is a big problem because mobile phones plays a very important role in our daily life especially we are now in a digital world. Mobile phones can help us do our work easier and it helps us connected all throughout the world. I'm not crazy about my mobile phone but I feel safe when I have it with me. 1. Kate can't exist without her mobile phone. 2. She got her mobile phone in January. 3. She usually listens to music on her mobile phone. 4. There's a calculator in her mobile phone. 5. Her parents bought her the mobile phone two years ago..</a>

                                            Instructions: Read the text and answer the questions below. (2 points each)Our Loyal FriendsWe havo often heard the adage A dog is a man's best friend' This has proven to be true time andagain, dogs have not only served as faithful pets, but also as workers and protectors. For example,in the Icy regions of Alaska, Huskies are often used to pull sleds, while the Doberman Pinschers areknown for being vigilant watchdogs.Dogs make endearing pets. Once they come to accept their human owners, dogs often remainstubbomly faithful to them even in the face of danger. This can be seen from the accounts offearless dogs which saved their owners from burning houses or protected them against intruders,Indeed, once they pledge their loyally, it can be readily assumed that these amazing animals willremain faithful for lifeMany dog owners believe that their pets are sensitive to their feelings and are able to respond tothem The truth of this, however, remains uncertain The wild ancestors of dogs hunted in packs, sotheir responses were guided by those of the pack leader Perhaps, in the case of domesticated dogs,the role of the pack leader falls on the dog owner Thus, a dog which seems upset when its master isupsel may simply be following its pack instinct. However, many dog owners testify to the fact thattheir dogs can sense their emotions even when they do not display themMost domestic dogs are expected to be able to understand and obey simple commands so that thedog owner can maintain some control over them. Dogs are best trained when they are young, anolder dog might be too set in its ways to change Dog Training sessions are best carried out when theanimal is hungry, in this way, it can be rewarded with food Basic commands such as 'siť, 'stay'.'come' and 'quiet' are the easiest to teach Some dog owners try to teach their dogs tricks such asrolling over and fetching newspapers. These tricks are best taught when the dogs are older, aboutsix months old. Persistent training sessions are necessary if a dog is to learn commands, and in time,a dog might even come to recognize its owner's emotions through the mere tone of his voiceSpeaking in a high pitch relays positive feelings, while a low pitch warns the dog that its master isdispleased.1 Give an example of dogs being used as protectors2. From the second paragraph, find a word that means 'descriplions'.3. hat could be an explanation of dogs being sensitive to their owner's feelings?4. Why is it said that dogs are best trained when they are young?5 What sophisticated skill could be learnt by a dog with enough time and practice?​</a>

                            19. MY MOBILE PHONE Hello, I'm Kate. I want to write about my mobile phone. I got it from my parents for my birthday two years ago. I like it very much and I think it's sometimes good to have it in my bag. I always keep it in my bag or in my pocket so my parents and my friends can always call me. It's got a calculator in it so I sometimes use it at school. I can use my mobile phone to connect to the Internet and look through the news or read emails. Isn't it fantastic? Last year I was on a cycling holiday with my friend. We went cycling but the weather wasn't good. It was cold and windy. It started to rain and it got dark. Suddenly my friend fell off her bike and she broke her leg. At first I didn't know what to do but I thought about my phone. It was in my backpack so I called for help. After fifteen minutes a doctor arrived. Sometimes people are not used on exploring their mobile phones which is a big problem because mobile phones plays a very important role in our daily life especially we are now in a digital world. Mobile phones can help us do our work easier and it helps us connected all throughout the world. I'm not crazy about my mobile phone but I feel safe when I have it with me. 1. Kate can't exist without her mobile phone. 2. She got her mobile phone in January. 3. She usually listens to music on her mobile phone. 4. There's a calculator in her mobile phone. 5. Her parents bought her the mobile phone two years no​</h2><br />

                            21. Instructions: Read the text and answer the questions below. (2 points each)Our Loyal FriendsWe havo often heard the adage A dog is a man's best friend' This has proven to be true time andagain, dogs have not only served as faithful pets, but also as workers and protectors. For example,in the Icy regions of Alaska, Huskies are often used to pull sleds, while the Doberman Pinschers areknown for being vigilant watchdogs.Dogs make endearing pets. Once they come to accept their human owners, dogs often remainstubbomly faithful to them even in the face of danger. This can be seen from the accounts offearless dogs which saved their owners from burning houses or protected them against intruders,Indeed, once they pledge their loyally, it can be readily assumed that these amazing animals willremain faithful for lifeMany dog owners believe that their pets are sensitive to their feelings and are able to respond tothem The truth of this, however, remains uncertain The wild ancestors of dogs hunted in packs, sotheir responses were guided by those of the pack leader Perhaps, in the case of domesticated dogs,the role of the pack leader falls on the dog owner Thus, a dog which seems upset when its master isupsel may simply be following its pack instinct. However, many dog owners testify to the fact thattheir dogs can sense their emotions even when they do not display themMost domestic dogs are expected to be able to understand and obey simple commands so that thedog owner can maintain some control over them. Dogs are best trained when they are young, anolder dog might be too set in its ways to change Dog Training sessions are best carried out when theanimal is hungry, in this way, it can be rewarded with food Basic commands such as 'siť, 'stay'.'come' and 'quiet' are the easiest to teach Some dog owners try to teach their dogs tricks such asrolling over and fetching newspapers. These tricks are best taught when the dogs are older, aboutsix months old. Persistent training sessions are necessary if a dog is to learn commands, and in time,a dog might even come to recognize its owner's emotions through the mere tone of his voiceSpeaking in a high pitch relays positive feelings, while a low pitch warns the dog that its master isdispleased.1 Give an example of dogs being used as protectors2. From the second paragraph, find a word that means 'descriplions'.3. hat could be an explanation of dogs being sensitive to their owner's feelings?4. Why is it said that dogs are best trained when they are young?5 What sophisticated skill could be learnt by a dog with enough time and practice?​</h2><br />
