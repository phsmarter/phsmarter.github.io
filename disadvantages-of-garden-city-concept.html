                            1. what is the disadvantages of gardening​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>May cause back pain for older people. It causes yard pests like moles, mice sometimes. they are hard to keep up with. fertilizer is heavy which may cause back pain as well. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope this helps :)</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Disadvantages of Planting a Garden</p><p></p><p>Gardens can supply fresh food and improve the appearance of the landscape, but growing your own vegetables or flowers comes with some potential drawbacks. A backyard garden requires a great deal of work and commitment throughout the growing season. Acknowledging the disadvantages of growing a garden can help you determine if the project is worth the effort to you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Cost</p><p>Vegetable gardens are considered money savers, but a garden comes with its own expenses that may cost you more than buying the vegetables would. When you initially create your garden beds, potential costs include a tiller, shovel, rake, hoe and edging material. After the initial investment, the yearly costs are lower, but expenses still include seeds, plants, compost, topsoil, fertilizer, mulch and support systems like trellises or tomato cages. You also see an increase in your water bill for irrigation of the garden. Limiting your garden size can help keep costs under control.</p><p></p><p>Vacation Coverage</p><p>The typical growing season spans several months. In warmer climates, many plants grow most of the year. If you're gone for long periods of time, you'll either need to ask someone to watch your garden or risk unhealthy or dying plants when you return. Having a neighbor or friend harvest vegetables and perform garden maintenance tasks while you're gone can be repaid with fresh vegetables or cut flowers.</p><p></p><p>Lost Space</p><p>Even with efficient use of space, a garden takes away a portion of your lawn or patio. If your property is small, this means even less space for other activities like entertaining, playing or creating seating areas. Only making the garden large enough to grow what your family will eat can limit your lost area. Using trellises to train vine vegetables like peas or squash to grow vertically and mixing vegetable plants in with existing flower beds can also help.</p><p></p><p>Injuries</p><p>Gardening requires physical exertion, including lots of bending, stooping, digging and carrying. The repeated gardening actions put strain on your back and joints like your knees. If you already have problems with pain or limited mobility, taking care of your garden can worsen those symptoms. Lifting, stooping or performing other actions incorrectly may also lead to injury, such as a pulled muscle. I makes sense to keep your garden small if you have physical limitations and take breaks while gardening to avoid injury to your muscles or joints. You can also hire a professional to handle some of the garden care.</p><p></p><p>Disadvantages of Gardening</p><p> </p><p></p><p>1  Gardening isn’t necessarily fun</p><p></p><p>Digging, kneeling, stooping or bending over, and a variety of other repetitive movements that are all part of gardening can be harmful to your joints, to your bones, to your muscles, and can cause blisters on your hands and possibly also on your feet. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>It’s possible to get carpal tunnel syndrome if you utilize your hands, or hand, in a repetitive motion when gardening. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>When you’re kneeling, you can get knee-related problems.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>When you’re bending over, your back can start to ache. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>Plus, many types of gardening machinery are not necessarily completely safe to use. Chainsaw, anyone?</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>2  Garden-related infections</p><p></p><p>There’s no argument that garden soil can play host to harmful pathogens.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>You can get tetanus (otherwise known as lock jaw), you can get Lyme disease, you can get Legionnaires disease, you can get Weil’s disease (from rats), you can pick up fungal infections that are the cause of respiratory illness. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>3  Gardening is not a cheap pursuit</p><p></p><p>Ever thought about hiring a landscaper to design your garden? Unless you have an extremely small garden, you’ll be looking at investing many thousands into the project. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>But, even if you don’t need to do any landscaping, there’s the gardening equipment to buy.</p><p></p><p>There are the plants to buy.</p><p></p><p>There are the variety of soil amendments to buy, inclusive of fertilizers.</p><p></p><p>Investment into a greenhouse, perhaps?</p><p></p><p>You may need some garden machinery, too, such as a lawnmower, a chainsaw, a hedge trimmer…</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>4  The law is not always on your side</p><p></p><p>You may not be aware of this, but throughout the country, there are municipal governments that do not permit backyard or front yard vegetable gardens. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>If anyone complains about your veggie garden exploits, you could face a fine, you’ll be forced to ditch your veggie garden, and you could even face jail time. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>You should be mindful of tree-related issues, too.</p><p></p><p> </p><br />

It’s more difficult to figure out exactly how many plants you’ll get in a certain area with triangular spacing.<br />

Relying on the product to ‘sell itself’ can result in some audiences being neglected from the advertising. Therefore there may be consumers that would have bought the product but are not made particularly aware of its launch and availability. Not carrying out detailed research about your target audience means that you could miss prime advertising opportunities or not supply the product specifications for the audience’s desires and needs. </p><br />

                            11. Advantage and disadvantage of product concept</h2><br />
                        ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF PRODUCT CONCEPT OF MARKETINGADVANTAGES OF PRODUCT CONCEPT<p><strong>1. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY</strong></p><p>The first and foremost advantage of <strong>product concept</strong> of marketing is that company following this concept focuses on quality of the product rather than quantity of product because products of companies which focus on quantity over quality will be of substandard quality and such companies primary concern is to sell whatever they produce without thinking about the satisfaction level of the consumer which is not the case with product concept of marketing.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>2. CURIOSITY FACTOR</strong></p><p>It helps the company in creating curiosity in the minds of the customers because since company adds a unique feature with every new launch customers as well as competitors know that the company will come with something new and hence that curiosity factor will always be there in the minds of the customer which will ensure that company will remain in the limelight both in the press or news as well as in the minds of the customers.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. HIGHER MARGIN</strong></p><p>Companies following <strong>product concept</strong> of marketing can charge a higher price for their product even when there are competitors in the market because company under product concept of marketing is giving a quality product having different features than available competitors products and hence the scope of higher profit margin will always be there under this concept of marketing.</p>DISADVANTAGES OF PRODUCT CONCEPT<p><strong>1. MAJORITY OF CONSUMERS ARE PRICE CONSCIOUS</strong></p><p>The assumption that if the quality of the product is good then customers will be willing to pay any price is flawed as the majority of consumers are price conscious and such type of customers will buy competitors products even if it is of lower quality. In simple words, this strategy can work only for those products or markets where the price of the product does not matter the only thing that matters is the quality of the product or service.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. IRRELEVANT FEATURES</strong></p><p>Another limitation of <strong>product concept </strong>of marketing is that sometimes companies pack their products with features which do not add value to the product and on the name of those features company charges a higher price from the customers. Hence for example if you are thirsty and want to drink water than it doesn’t matter whether you drink water in aluminum glass or silver glass but sometimes companies try to do exactly this that is they take more money for giving you silver glass even when you would have got the same satisfaction from drinking water in aluminum glass.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>3. CONSUMERS INTERESTS ARE IGNORED</strong></p><p>Companies in <strong>product concept</strong> of marketing add features to the product according to their internal research rather than taking customers opinion which ensures that customer interests are ignored because customers do not get the product they want rather they get that product which company has conceptualized.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Read more here:</p><p>Difference between social and non-profit marketing</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2548523</p><p>What is marketing?</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2184594</p><p>Goals of marketing</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2184596</p>#LetsStudy<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Gardening requires physical exertion, including lots of bending, stooping, digging and carrying. The repeated gardening actions put strain on your back and joints like your knees. If you already have problems with pain or limited mobility, taking care of your garden can worsen those symptoms.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>We need to grow our own food with the kind of world we’re in. There is no excuse whatsoever to consume poisonous food. Farmers use a lot of chemicals to increase yield and battle pests. Such chemicals represent a real danger to us. We have long-term and health effects on our bodies. Such results are also passed on to the next generations in many situations. Therefore, at any cost, we must counter this. We can choose Natural or Gmo Foods. But not a lot of farmers opt for organic farming. It is, therefore, the best option to grow your own meat.</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️</p><p>[tex]it \: is\: more \: risk \: of \: pests \\ because \: pests \: eats \: vegetable[/tex]</p><p>☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️</p><br />

                            24. How is hydroponic gardening different from traditional gardening?
(Remember to mention the advantages and disadvantages of hydroponic
gardening over traditional gardening.)</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Hydroponic gardening is a method of growing plants without soil, while traditional gardening involves growing plants in soil. </p><p></p><p>Advantages of hydroponic gardening over traditional gardening include:</p><p></p><p>1. Water conservation: Hydroponic gardening uses significantly less water than traditional gardening since water is continuously recirculated through the system, reducing waste.</p><p></p><p>2. Space efficiency: Hydroponic systems can be set up vertically, allowing for more plants to be grown in a smaller area compared to traditional gardening.</p><p></p><p>3. Faster growth: Plants grown hydroponically typically grow faster than those grown in soil since they receive a balanced nutrient solution and do not have to compete with other plants for nutrients.</p><p></p><p>4. Fewer pests and diseases: Hydroponic gardening is less susceptible to pests and diseases than traditional gardening since the soil does not provide a breeding ground for them.</p><p></p><p>Disadvantages of hydroponic gardening over traditional gardening include:</p><p></p><p>1. Cost: Hydroponic systems can be expensive to set up and maintain, requiring specialized equipment and a consistent supply of nutrients.</p><p></p><p>2. Expertise: Hydroponic gardening requires more knowledge and expertise than traditional gardening since it involves monitoring and maintaining complex systems.</p><p></p><p>3. Power dependency: Hydroponic systems require electricity to run pumps and lights, making them dependent on a consistent power supply.</p><p></p><p>4. Limited crop selection: Certain crops may not grow well in hydroponic systems, limiting the types of plants that can be grown.</p><p></p><p>In summary, hydroponic gardening offers several advantages over traditional gardening, including water conservation, space efficiency, faster growth, and fewer pests and diseases. However, it also has some disadvantages, including higher cost, expertise requirements, power dependency, and limited crop selection.</p><br />

You pull them out and they just seem to come right back.</p><p></p>Dirty Fingernails, Blisters and Other Hand Injuries<p></p><p>Digging in the garden will give you dirty fingernails and this can require a lot of scrubbing. The best way to avoid this is to wear gloves. If gloves are not your thing, running your fingernails over a bar of soap before pulling weeds or using garden tools should make cleanup a breeze.</p><p></p><p>Gloves will also help protect your hands from blisters and other similar hand injuries.</p><p></p>Back and Knee Strain<p></p><p>Another problem common to gardeners is back injuries. Bending, stooping, digging and carrying can put a strain on your back and joints like your knees. If you already have problems with pain or limited mobility, taking care of your garden can make these symptoms worse.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Keep your garden small if you have physical limitations and take breaks while gardening to avoid injury to your muscles or joints. You can also set up raised garden beds or gardening containers that make it easier to tend your garden where you don’t have to bend so much.</p><p></p><p>To prevent this type of injury, always use proper body mechanics.</p><p></p>Insect Bites and Stings<p></p><p>Insect bites and stings can make gardening downright uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>However, there are ways to minimize these problems as well. Avoid using perfumed soaps, shampoos and deodorants. Be sure to cover exposed skin, especially if you are working in the garden when bugs are most active and apply DEET to clothing. Wear shoes when gardening. If you see bees or wasps nearby, remain calm around them. Never disturb their nests. Remove any standing water where mosquitoes can breed. Keep any drinking containers covered (especially sweetened drinks) to prevent insects from getting inside.</p><p></p>Having to Wait for Results<p></p><p>In our world of instant breakfasts, microwave ovens, and cell phones, waiting for a harvest is difficult. Let’s face it. If you plant a seed today, it will be several weeks, if not months before you get a crop. Delayed gratification is a good practice to cultivate along with your garden, so plant your seeds and learn to enjoy the wait.</p><p></p><p></p>High Costs<p></p><p>Cost of getting started can be high, especially if you’re buying power equipment.</p><p></p><p>So called experts say that having a vegetable garden can save you money, but gardening can get expensive if you don’t watch your costs. When you initially create your garden beds, potential costs include a tiller, shovel, rake, hoe and edging material. After the initial investment, the yearly costs are lower, but expenses still include seeds, plants, compost, topsoil, fertilizer,. mulch and support systems like trellises or tomato cages. You also see an increase in your water bill for irrigation of the garden. Limiting your garden size can help keep costs down</p><p></p>Vegetable Gardening Takes Space<p></p><p>Even with efficient use of space, a garden takes away a portion of your lawn or patio. If your property is small, you’ll have less space for entertaining or play areas.</p><p></p>Need to Care for the Garden Even When You're on Vacation<p></p><p>The typical gardening season lasts several months and often during vacation time. If you're gone for more than a few days, you'll either need to ask someone to watch your garden or risk unhealthy or dying plants when you return. Having a neighbor or friend harvest vegetables and perform garden maintenance tasks while you're gone can be repaid with fresh vegetables. You can also offer to do gardening for another gardening friend if you know that that friend will also be going on vacation during gardening season.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Wasted Garden Produce<p></p><p>In some cases, extra produce becomes too much and garden produce is wasted because you planted too much or mother nature decided that this year was the year of bounty for that specific crop. Though this is not a terrible problem to have, it may seem like a waste.</p><p></p><p></p>Dirty Produce Can Be Hard to Clean<p></p><p>When gardens are planted using traditional methods where bare ground is the rule, produce picked is often dirty especially produce like lettuce. To prevent this, mulching helps keep your garden produce clean.</p><p></p>Insects and Disease<p></p><p>Plant diseases, insects, and other animals can wipe out entire crops. The best way to deal with plant diseases is to understand why the plant diseases existed and do what you can to rectify the problem. </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>-Time.  
</p><p>-Cost.  </p><p>-Vacation Coverage.  </p><p>-Lost Space.  </p><p>-Injuries.
