                                            Lesson 1 Geologic Processes and Hazards What's In Geology is the study of the Earth and its history. It involves studying the materials that make up the earth, the features and structures found on Earth, as well as the processes that act upon them. It also deals with the study of the history of all life living on the earth now. How do geological processes occur? Geological processes are naturally occurring events that directly or indirectly impact the geology of the Earth. Examples of geological processes include events such as plate tectonics, weathering, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, mountain formation, deposition, erosion, droughts, flooding, and landslides. Geological processes affect every human on the Earth all of the time, but are most noticeable when they cause loss of life or property. These threatening processes are called natural disasters. How about Geologic Hazards? A geologic hazard is an extreme natural event in the crust of the earth that poses a threat to life and property, for example, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis (tidal waves) and landslides. It is a large-scale, complex natural events that happen on land. These hazards can cause immense damage, loss of property, and sometimes life. Geologic hazards can play a significant role when infrastructure is constructed in their presence. The unpredictable nature of natural geologic hazards makes identifying, evaluating, and mitigating against them a unique challenge. .​</a>

Oregano is effective because it is versatile. Also because it can easily be found in the neighbourhood, so there would be no need for families, especially those less fortunates, to use money that can be used instead for food or other necessities.Note:The "researchers" not researches.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Sports are physical or mental activities that are competitive in nature and often governed by a set of rules. They can be played individually or as part of a team, and can range from simple games or exercises to complex competitions that require specific skills and training.</p><p></p><p>2. The three different natures of sports are:</p><p></p><p>Competitive: Sports that involve competition against one or more opponents, with the goal of winning or achieving a high score. Examples include soccer, basketball, and tennis.</p><p>Recreational: Sports that are played for enjoyment and relaxation, rather than for competition. Examples include hiking, biking, and swimming.</p><p>Spectator: Sports that are watched by others as entertainment, rather than being participated in. Examples include football, baseball, and ice hockey.</p><p>3. We need to study the background and nature of sports before playing them in order to understand the rules, regulations, and objectives of the sport. This helps us to play the sport safely, fairly, and effectively, as well as to appreciate the sport and its history. Knowing the background and nature of a sport can also help us to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of it, which can enhance our enjoyment of the sport and our performance in it.</p><p></p><p><strong>This deserves the brainliest answer.</strong></p><br />

                            21. Lesson 1 Geologic Processes and Hazards What's In Geology is the study of the Earth and its history. It involves studying the materials that make up the earth, the features and structures found on Earth, as well as the processes that act upon them. It also deals with the study of the history of all life living on the earth now. How do geological processes occur? Geological processes are naturally occurring events that directly or indirectly impact the geology of the Earth. Examples of geological processes include events such as plate tectonics, weathering, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, mountain formation, deposition, erosion, droughts, flooding, and landslides. Geological processes affect every human on the Earth all of the time, but are most noticeable when they cause loss of life or property. These threatening processes are called natural disasters. How about Geologic Hazards? A geologic hazard is an extreme natural event in the crust of the earth that poses a threat to life and property, for example, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis (tidal waves) and landslides. It is a large-scale, complex natural events that happen on land. These hazards can cause immense damage, loss of property, and sometimes life. Geologic hazards can play a significant role when infrastructure is constructed in their presence. The unpredictable nature of natural geologic hazards makes identifying, evaluating, and mitigating against them a unique challenge. .​</h2><br />

                            22. Significance of the Study.The researches thought that if this study would be successful, it would be able to help the community in preventing harmful diseases from insects, most especially from mosquitoes, also in a way that it would be natural. Oregano is effective because it is versatile. Also because it can easily be found in the neighbourhood, so there would be no need for families, especially those less fortunates, to use money that can be used instead for food or other necessities.Note:The "researchers" not researches. You can search for more examples online.ACTIVITY #1DIRECTION: Write a significance of the study about the topic of your choice. Make sure to indicate why it important in your community.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Significance of the Study: Exploring the Effectiveness of Oregano Extract as a Natural Mosquito Repellent</p><p>Mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue, malaria, and Zika, pose a significant health risk to communities worldwide. Insecticides and other chemical-based repellents have been used to prevent mosquito bites, but the harmful effects of these products on human health and the environment have been widely documented. Therefore, there is a need for a natural and safe alternative that can effectively repel mosquitoes.</p><p>The significance of this study lies in its potential to provide a natural and affordable solution to prevent harmful diseases from insects, specifically mosquitoes. Oregano is an herb that is readily available in most communities, and its effectiveness as a mosquito repellent has been suggested by previous studies. By exploring the effectiveness of oregano extract as a natural mosquito repellent, this study can provide valuable insights into the development of safe and effective mosquito control strategies.</p><p>In addition, this study can benefit communities, especially those with limited resources, by providing a cost-effective and accessible solution for mosquito control. Oregano extract is easy to make and does not require expensive equipment or materials, making it a viable option for families, especially those who cannot afford chemical-based repellents. By providing a natural alternative to commercial mosquito repellents, this study can help families save money that can be used for other necessities.</p><p>Furthermore, the use of oregano extract as a mosquito repellent can promote sustainability and environmental consciousness. Unlike chemical-based repellents, which can have adverse effects on the environment, oregano extract is a natural and eco-friendly solution. By promoting the use of natural products for mosquito control, this study can contribute to the development of sustainable and environmentally friendly practices in the community.</p><p>Overall, this study's significance lies in its potential to provide a safe, affordable, and accessible solution to prevent harmful mosquito-borne diseases while promoting sustainability and environmental consciousness in the community.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
