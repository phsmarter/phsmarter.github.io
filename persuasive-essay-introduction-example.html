</p><p>PERSUASIVE ESSAY SAMPLES
</p><p>Essay 1 Why Students Should Eat Breakfast Every Day
</p><p>A lot of people, especially young people, go through the day without having breakfast.
</p><p>Many people believe that it is not necessary, or they say that they don’t have time for
</p><p>that, and begin their day with no meal. I believe that everyone should eat breakfast
</p><p>before going to their activities. The purpose of this paper is to show the importance of
</p><p>breakfast, especially for students. THESIS STATEMENT
</p><p>The first reason why you should eat breakfast before going to school is for your
</p><p>health. When you skip breakfast and go to school, you are looking for a disease because
</p><p>it’s not healthy to have an empty stomach all day long. It’s very important to have a
</p><p>meal and not let your stomach work empty. All you are going to get is gastritis and a lot
</p><p>of problems with your health if you don’t eat breakfast.
</p><p>Another reason for eating breakfast is because you need food for to do well in
</p><p>your classes. You body and your brain are not going to function as good as they could
</p><p>because you have no energy and no strength. When you try to learn something and have
</p><p>nothing in your stomach, you are going to have a lot of trouble succeeding. A lot of
</p><p>people think that they should not eat because they are going to feel tired, but that’s not
</p><p>true. Breakfast is not a very big meal, and on the contrary, you’re going to feel tired if
</p><p>you don’t have breakfast because you have spent the entire previous night without
</p><p>food.
</p><p>The last reason to have breakfast every day is because you can avoid diseases if
</p><p>you eat some breakfast in the morning. If you don’t eat, you are going to get sick, and
</p><p>these diseases will have a stronger effect on you because you’re going to get sick easier
</p><p>than people who have breakfast every day.
</p><p>You have to realize that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and you
</p><p>cannot skip it without consequences for your health, your school and your defense
</p><p>mechanism. It is better to wake up earlier and have a good breakfast that run to school</p><br />

                        Certainly! This is an illustration of a strong argumentative essay on the subject of outlawing plastic bags:<br /><br />Topic: Plastic bag ban<br /><br />Introduction:<br />In spite of their widespread use and apparent convenience for carrying groceries or other items, plastic bags have a major negative impact on the environment. Billions of plastic bags pollute our oceans and damage wildlife every year by ending up in landfills or as public litter. We must take steps to lessen our dependence on single-use plastics in order to safeguard our planet and keep it intact for future generations. Bans on plastic bags are an important first move.<br /><br />Body:<br />There are several strong arguments in favor of outlawing plastic bags. They are, first and foremost, a significant cause of pollution. Plastic bags do not biodegrade, so they will either wind up in our oceans where they can harm or destroy marine life, or they will sit in landfills for hundreds of years. Second, the manufacture of plastic bags uses a lot of fossil fuels, which increases greenhouse gas pollution and the effects of climate change. Third, plastic bags are frequently only used once before being tossed away, wasting precious resources and adding to the issue of overconsumption as a whole.<br /><br />The prohibition on plastic bags does not, however, leave us without any other choices. Instead, use reusable bags made of fabric, canvas, or other materials. These bags are more durable than plastic bags and can be used repeatedly to cut down on trash and conserve resources. In reality, a lot of supermarkets and shops already give customers who bring their own bags discounts or other rewards.<br /><br />Studies have shown that the long-term advantages of banning plastic bags far outweigh any short-term expenses, despite claims to the contrary. There has been a substantial decrease in plastic waste and litter in areas where plastic bag bans have been enacted, such as California and Hawaii. Additionally, companies have come up with inventive methods to comply with the ban, like selling reusable bags or switching to paper bags.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />In conclusion, outlawing plastic bags is a crucial move we can take to safeguard the environment and lessen our environmental impact. While changing our habits may require some work, the advantages of lowering plastic pollution and protecting our natural resources make it worthwhile. Reusable bag use and backing of plastic bag bans are two ways we can help the earth and leave a better world for future generations.<br /><br /><br />
