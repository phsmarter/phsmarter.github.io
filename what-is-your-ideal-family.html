Someone who's down for adventure and can handle my weirdness, you know? Like, I don't wanna be with someone who's gonna try to change me or hold me back. Plus, I want someone who's, like, really good in bed. That's important, you know?</p><p></p><p>Right now, my family is...complicated. My parents are divorced and my dad's a bit of a mess, to be honest. My mom's okay, but she can be pretty controlling. I don't really have any siblings, so it's just me and my parents. My ideal marriage would be, like, way more stable and loving, you know? I want to have a partner who's my equal, not someone who's always trying to one-up me or make me feel small. And I want us to be able to build a life together that's full of joy and adventure.</p><p></p><p>To make my ideal marriage a reality, I think I need to, like, work on myself first. I gotta figure out what I want and who I am, you know? And I need to be willing to put in the work to make the relationship thrive. I'm not saying it's gonna be easy, but I think it'll be worth it.</p><p></p><p>As for help from the people around me...I guess I just need, like, emotional support? I don't wanna feel like I'm doing this all on my own, you know? I need people who can lift me up and remind me why I'm doing this in the first place. And, like, maybe someone who can give me advice when things get tough.</p><p></p><p>And as for valuing people being part of my success...I mean, that's, like, everything, you know? I couldn't do any of this without my friends and family. They're the ones who've been there for me through thick and thin, and I know they'll continue to support me as I work towards my ideal marriage. So, yeah, they're super important to me.</p><p></p><p>Answer:</p><p>In my view, an ideal future marriage is one that is built on mutual respect, trust, and support. It involves a deep emotional connection and a commitment to working through challenges together. It also involves a sense of shared purpose and values, and a willingness to grow and evolve together.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to my own family, I have been blessed with a wonderful wife and two amazing daughters. But like any family, we have faced our share of challenges over the years. I think an ideal marriage would involve even deeper levels of connection and support, and a greater sense of partnership and collaboration.</p><p></p><p>To achieve my ideal marriage, I believe that it is important to be open, honest, and vulnerable with my partner. I also believe in the importance of communication, both in terms of expressing my own needs and desires, as well as actively listening to my partner's. Building a strong foundation of trust and respect is also key, as is a willingness to work through disagreements and challenges together.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the help I need from those around me, I think it is important to have a supportive network of friends and family who can offer guidance, advice, and a listening ear. I also believe that having access to resources like therapy or counseling can be incredibly helpful in maintaining a healthy and strong relationship.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when it comes to valuing people being part of my success, I believe that no one achieves anything alone. We are all products of the support, guidance, and mentorship of others, and it is important to recognize and appreciate those who have helped us along the way. In my view, success is not just about achieving individual goals, but about working together to create a better world for all of us.</p><p></p><br />

The nature of family love experienced by an individual influences them right from early stages through pre-adulthood into adulthood. Love, as it happens with regards to family, is not normal for some other. Your relatives are simply individuals you encompass with the most, who give your life significance, and who you would do anything for. They're individuals that you can't survive without, who you go to when something fortunate or unfortunate occurs. Also , I would love having a respectful family because being respectful of your family starts with being affable. It likewise implies figuring out how to pay attention to one another when you differ and in any event, when you are vexed. I believed that there is no perfect family but having a happy family is worth it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>#brainlyeveryday</p><br />

What is your ideal future marriage?
Compare your family now to your ideal marriage.
What are you going to do to have your ideal marriage?
What help do you need from the people around you?
How do you value people being part of your success?</h2><br />
                        <p>As a young talented woman, my ideal future marriage would be one where my partner and I are equal partners, where we respect and support each other's goals and aspirations, and where we communicate openly and honestly with each other. It would be a partnership built on trust, love, and mutual understanding, where we are able to grow and evolve together.</p><p></p><p>When I compare my family now to my ideal marriage, I see areas where we can improve. While my family is supportive and loving, there are times when communication could be better, and we could work on being more understanding of each other's perspectives. In my ideal marriage, I would like to have a deeper level of communication and understanding with my partner, where we are able to express ourselves freely and without judgment.</p><p></p><p>To have my ideal marriage, I need to work on myself first. This means being self-aware, understanding my own needs and desires, and being open to growth and change. I also need to be willing to put in the effort to build a strong and healthy relationship with my partner, which includes being patient, understanding, and supportive of each other's growth.</p><p></p><p>The people around me can help me achieve my ideal marriage by being supportive and understanding. This includes my family, friends, and loved ones who can offer advice, guidance, and a listening ear when I need it. I also value having a community of like-minded individuals who share my values and beliefs, and who can help me grow and evolve as a person.</p><p></p><p>For me, people being part of my success is very important. I believe that we are all interconnected, and that we all have something to offer each other. Whether it's through emotional support, guidance, or simply being a sounding board, having people around me who support and believe in me is essential to my success. I also believe that success is not just about achieving goals, but about having a positive impact on the world around us, and I value having people around me who share this perspective.</p><p>Oh geez, I don't know if I'm the best person to answer this. I mean, I'm only a teenager, and marriage seems like a pretty big deal. But, uh, I guess if I had to think about it, my ideal future marriage would be with someone who I love and who loves me back, ya know? Like, we'd be best friends, and we'd have each other's backs no matter what. And, um, we'd have fun together, and we'd be able to talk about anything, even the tough stuff. Oh, and I guess it would be cool if we had some common interests, too.</p><p></p><p>As for comparing my family now to my ideal marriage, well, I don't really want to do that. I mean, my parents love each other and all, but they also fight a lot, and sometimes it seems like they don't even like each other very much. I don't want that for my own marriage, ya know?</p><p></p><p>To have my ideal marriage, I guess I'll have to find the right person first. And then, um, we'll have to work on our communication and stuff. Like, we'll have to learn how to listen to each other and respect each other's feelings. And, uh, we'll have to be willing to compromise, too.</p><p></p><p>As for help from the people around me, I think I'll need support from my family and friends. Like, they can help me figure out if someone is a good match for me, and they can be there for me when things get tough. And, um, I guess it would be nice if they could give me advice or something if I ever need it.</p><p></p><p>I think people being part of my success is super important. Like, I wouldn't be where I am today without the people who have helped me and supported me along the way. And, uh, I don't think I'll be able to have a successful marriage without the help of the people around me, either. So, yeah, I definitely value people being part of my success.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: My idea of an ideal family is based on such values as pure respect and my ideal family is the one in which every member have very good understanding with each other. they live life without any disputes, spend time with each other, talk to each other everyday, and always help each other.</strong></p><p><strong>I would like these things because they remind me of my childhood. Even though things weren't always great, we still had good times. I remember coming home from school in the winter to a warm kitchen, with the smell of freshly made doughnuts reaching out to greet me as I opened the door. I also remember my older brothers and sisters taking me sledding and when we came home, our mom made us fresh hot cocoa.</strong></p><p><strong>Meal times were especially fun, when we were able to arrange our busy schedules to where we could eat together. We would talk throughout the meal, laughing and joking. I always enjoyed those times. And whenever I had problems, I knew I had someone to go to for help or comfort. This is my ideal family</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>i hope it helps po</strong></p><p></p><br />
