                                            Life's StoryThe great American short story expert, O. Henry, wrote a famous Christmas story. It is about a young married couple who were very much in love Christmas was approaching and they wanted to give a present to one another. But they were very poor and had no money for presents . So each one, without telling the other, decided to sell her/his most precious possession. The girl prized above all else her long golden hair. She went to a hairdresser and had it cut off. She, then, sold it to buy a lovely watch chain for her husband's watch. He, in the meantime, went to a jeweler and sold the only watch he had to buy two beautiful combs for his beloved's hair. On Christmas, they exchanged their gifts. At first they cried and then they laughed. There was no hair for the comb, and no watch for the watch chain. But there was something more precious and that was the idea behind their gifts: each had deprived self to give the best to the other... 15 A gift is no gift if it does not cost us something, if it does not contain a part of ourselves.

                            19. Life's StoryThe great American short story expert, O. Henry, wrote a famous Christmas story. It is about a young married couple who were very much in love Christmas was approaching and they wanted to give a present to one another. But they were very poor and had no money for presents . So each one, without telling the other, decided to sell her/his most precious possession. The girl prized above all else her long golden hair. She went to a hairdresser and had it cut off. She, then, sold it to buy a lovely watch chain for her husband's watch. He, in the meantime, went to a jeweler and sold the only watch he had to buy two beautiful combs for his beloved's hair. On Christmas, they exchanged their gifts. At first they cried and then they laughed. There was no hair for the comb, and no watch for the watch chain. But there was something more precious and that was the idea behind their gifts: each had deprived self to give the best to the other... 15 A gift is no gift if it does not cost us something, if it does not contain a part of ourselves.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Exposition: In "A Rose for Emily," Faulkner's approach is not linear, as he moves back and forth in time. Although the story begins with Miss Emily's funeral, the exposition occurs shortly thereafter when we meet Miss Emily through the narrator’s eyes and are told something about her background, her family history, and her eccentricities. Two paragraphs after the opening, Faulkner begins the exposition with,
Alive, Miss Emily had been a tradition, a duty, and a care.</p><p></p><p>
Climax: Despite its position at the very beginning of the story, the climax occurs when Miss Emily dies. The story opens with the townspeople attending Miss Emily's funeral.
</p><p>
</p><p>Rising action: This occurs when Miss Emily goes to the pharmacist to purchase poison and we learn about the stench emanating from her home and that Homer has left her.
</p><p>
</p><p>Falling action: Immediately after Miss Emily’s funeral (the climax), the townspeople are able to get into her house for the first time in years. Their discovery there wraps everything up</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The exposition, climax, rising action, falling action, and resolution of "A Rose for Emily" occur in nonlinear order. The exposition is when we meet Miss Emily "alive" and learn her eccentricities. The climax occurs when she dies. Miss Emily purchasing poison, Homer's departure, and the stench are the rising action. The falling action occurs when the townspeople access her house after the funeral, and the resolution is their discovery of Homer's skeleton, the source of the stench many years before.</p><br />
