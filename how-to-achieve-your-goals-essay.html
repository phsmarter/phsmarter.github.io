                                            Read the following persuasive essay carefully. Encircle the verbs, box the adjectives, and underline the adverbs that express strong or pressing points. Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</a>

                                            Goals: Your goal is to write a reflective essay on developing the sense of nationalism.
 Your goal is to write a reflective essay expressing your appreciation to the struggles of the Filipinos during the Spanish colonization which helped you develop your sense of nationalism.
Role: You are a Filipino student.
Audience: Your classmates and teachers.
Situation: In this time that your generation’s (Generation Z) sense of nationalism, is being challenged by globalization, you are tasked to reflect and ask yourself about how much love you have for your country. You should share your own experience, which you think is comparable to the experiences of the Filipinos during the Spanish colonization in their struggle to achieve freedom and unity. You should also suggest ways on how your generation can deepen the sense of nationalism.
Performance: As you write your essay, you should consider the following:
1. For your introduction, choose one of the struggles experienced by the Filipinos during the Spanish period. Explain how these struggles affect their lives as native Filipinos.
2. For the body of your essay, relate these struggles with your own experiences by citing instances where you encountered struggles in your life and how you were able to cope with them.
3. For your conclusion, as a student explain how these struggles helped deepen your sense of nationalism. You may cite ways on how a student like you can deepen the sense of nationalism.</a>

                                            Summarize the short essay below. This object, the camera, is very important nowadays since our generation is incredibly tech-savvy. It is very useful to those who are fond of capturing special moments. This object is also essential to people who are into photography and vlogging. In much earlier times, people had to draw or paint pictures just to have a copy, and it would take hours to achieve the desired results and be able to show it to others. But with a camera, it only takes a few clicks if your goal is to show someone how beautiful or unique something is. In a lot of ways, using a camera is like compiling research. Research serves as our tool for building knowledge and facilitating learning. It nourishes our minds and introduces to us new discoveries. A camera can also serve as a tool for preserving new discoveries and sharing them with others. Without the camera, ordinary people without artistic inclinations would not be able to do so.  ​</a>

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review.

We need knowledge and skills for both our personal and professional development, which is why education is crucial. I intend to finish my degree program in the following three years, acquire real-world experience through internships, and take part in extracurricular activities to hone my leadership and people skills.A better job is my secondary goal. A job serves as a gateway for career progression and provides stable employment. I want to attend job fairs, look for employment in my field of study, network with business owners, and apply for those I find. I also want to improve my interviewing skills and resume in order to increase my chances of landing a good job.The third goal I have is to start my own company. Entrepreneurship has allowed me to generate something useful and be my own boss. Over the next three years, I plan to select a viable company idea, conduct market research, create a business plan, and seek funding to launch my venture. I also want to network with other businesspeople and attend business conferences to expand my knowledge and entrepreneurial skills.Conclusion:In conclusion, achieving success in life requires setting goals. I intend to accomplish three things over the next three years: finish my college education; find a better job; and launch my own business. But I'm committed to achieving these goals, and I believe I can do so if I put in the necessary effort, maintain my focus, and have a positive mindset.<p>For additional information please open the link: brainly.ph/question/11845739</p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                            7. Read the following persuasive essay carefully. Encircle the verbs, box the adjectives, and underline the adverbs that express strong or pressing points. Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>10 Reasons of Social Science:</strong></p><p>1. Social scientists help us imagine alternative futures.</p><p>Social science can open up debate and give us a say in shaping our collective future. The social sciences developed as a field of study during the nineteenth century. Social science helped people understand the consequences and application of the new technologies of the age, such as steam power.</p><p></p><p>The growth of railways and factories not only transformed the economy and the world of work, but also changed forever the way people organised their family lives and leisure. Today nanotechnology and advances in medical research will have a significant impact on the way we live.</p><p></p><p>They present us with a bewildering range of ethical, legal and social issues. But it isn’t enough to rely on the scientists. We also need social scientists to analyse and critique what’s going on. That way we will make informed choices that shape the future.</p><p></p><p>The Proactionary Imperative: For more ideas on this topic Steve Fuller's books are a good place to start.</p><p>2. Social science can help us make sense of our finances.</p><p>Social science is not just important for the future but for what’s happening now. We all resent paying to withdraw our money from cash machines. Charges can amount to £120 per year. Social scientists working on behalf of the Runnymede Trust found that this doesn’t just this depend on where we live, but that black and minority ethnic people are more likely to live in areas where they’re forced to pay.</p><p></p><p>This put pressure on banks to ensure we all have access to machines that don’t charge. A range of social scientists – not just economists but also psychologists, sociologists and political scientists, for example ‐ can help us understand the economic crisis and weigh up decisions we make for ourselves and those which governments make on our behalf. Without this kind of analysis we may feel like pawns in a global game of chess.</p><p></p><p>With the knowledge and understanding that social science offers us, we will feel empowered to act for ourselves, and to influence decisions being made on our behalf.</p><p></p><p>Unequal Ageing in Europe: explores the gender pension gap across the 28 member states of the European Union, plus Iceland and Norway</p><p>3. Social scientists contribute to our health and well‐being.</p><p>From sports sociologists to public health experts, from those interpreting medical statistics to those evaluating policies for our care in old age, social scientists are working hard to make sure that our health, leisure and social care services work to best effect.</p><p></p><p>Social geographers at the University of Sheffield, for example, have shown that those of us who don’t follow eating advice are not simply weak‐willed or ignorant. Our eating habits are influenced by a whole range of circumstances. Some apparently unhealthy choices may seem rational: if the person doing the shopping knows that others will simply not eat the healthy option and it will just go to waste, they may simply not buy it.</p><p></p><p>So it’s no good just giving people a booklet on healthy eating. Effective nutritional advice needs to be tailored to people’s everyday lives and contexts.</p><p></p><p>Long-Term Care in Europe: analyzes the key issues at stake in developing long-term care systems for older people in Europe.</p><p></p><p>Social Movements and Their Technologies: explores the interplay between social movements and their 'liberated technologies'.</p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p><p><strong>That's All I Know hope it helps&gt;3 # Carry On Learning...</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Social science, which is generally regarded as including psychology, sociology, anthropology, economics and political science, consists of the disciplined and systematic study of society and its institutions, and of how and why people behave as they do, both as individuals and in groups within society.</strong></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Social sciences are important because they create better institutions and systems that affect people's lives every day. Social sciences help people understand how to interact with the social world, how to influence policy, develop networks, increase government accountability, and promote democracy</strong></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>The single most important attribute to becoming successful is self-discipline. It helps you stay focused on reaching your goals, gives you the gumption to stick with difficult tasks, and allows you to overcome obstacles and discomfort as you push yourself to new heights.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><br />

"The Story Cinderella"1.consider the values conveyed in the portrayal of the good girl as passive weak submissive, but physically beautiful; and powerful woman as wicked and probably ugly cinderella?2.Consider the protentially misogynist theme of abused-girl-waiting-to-be-rescued-by-prince?"The Story Cinderella"THESISCinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.IN THE BEGINNINGCCinderella is oppressed by her father and his new wife. She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story.

​</h2><br />
                        <p>They said, "There's no success, in the first place," if you want to be successful you'll face the different challenges in life and one example of this is the pandemic right now. For me, I'll endure all the struggles and never give up, I'll face it all with determination, perseverance and by believing in myself that I can surpass it. I maybe fall, but then I'll stand up. Life is just a roller coaster, sometimes we are in down sometimes we are up, but the most important thing is that we don't easily give up in any challenges in life just this time. So, as long as I have goals the sacrifices is there, but I know after that sacrifices it will be worth it.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:Here’s an interesting trivia point:  The word “priority” entered the English language, via Old French, sometime in the 14th Century. Deriving from the mediaeval Latin word prioritas (“fact or condition of being prior”), the word meant “the most important thing”—the “prior” thing or the thing with precedence.  When it was first coined, the word “priority” had no plural.  You could only have one priority.  </strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Sometime in the middle of the 20th Century, almost certainly related to the rise of corporate and office culture, the word “priorities” began to appear. Now people began to claim that they had more than one “most important thing.”  They could have three or five or 14 priorities.  A client once shared with me a deck laying out his business’s “Top 30 Strategic Priorities.”  Sadly, if you have 30 priorities, you really have no priorities: no organization can even remember 30 things, never mind focus on them all.

"The Story Cinderella"1.consider the values conveyed in the portrayal of the good girl as passive weak submissive, but physically beautiful; and powerful woman as wicked and probably ugly cinderella?2.Consider the protentially misogynist theme of abused-girl-waiting-to-be-rescued-by-prince?"The Story Cinderella"THESISCinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.IN THE BEGINNINGCCinderella is oppressed by her father and his new wife. She is forced to perform traditional female tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The story allows for no solidarity among women. The stepmother is presented as a monster.THE RISING ACTIONGetting a dress and looking pretty is the only way she is able to be happy, to be noticed and to gain social power. In other words, keeping her ugly kept her from power. Beauty is seen as the only way a woman can be powerful.GOING TO THE BALLAt the ball, she meets the prince, who acts very possessive while also validating her, making her feel important – all because of her looks.Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewDANCING WITH THE PRINCEThe prince “falls in love” with her because she is the most beautiful. He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story.

                            20. Goals: Your goal is to write a reflective essay on developing the sense of nationalism.
 Your goal is to write a reflective essay expressing your appreciation to the struggles of the Filipinos during the Spanish colonization which helped you develop your sense of nationalism.
Role: You are a Filipino student.
Audience: Your classmates and teachers.
Situation: In this time that your generation’s (Generation Z) sense of nationalism, is being challenged by globalization, you are tasked to reflect and ask yourself about how much love you have for your country. You should share your own experience, which you think is comparable to the experiences of the Filipinos during the Spanish colonization in their struggle to achieve freedom and unity. You should also suggest ways on how your generation can deepen the sense of nationalism.
Performance: As you write your essay, you should consider the following:
1. For your introduction, choose one of the struggles experienced by the Filipinos during the Spanish period. Explain how these struggles affect their lives as native Filipinos.
2. For the body of your essay, relate these struggles with your own experiences by citing instances where you encountered struggles in your life and how you were able to cope with them.
3. For your conclusion, as a student explain how these struggles helped deepen your sense of nationalism. You may cite ways on how a student like you can deepen the sense of nationalism.</h2><br />

I was born and raised in the Philippines and throughout the years, I have seen the changes in the attitudes, practices, culture, and beliefs of the Filipinos. The world is continuously evolving, and the modernization is spreading across the world.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.A direction in which by its nature, moves us toward a more proactive, responsible and healthier existence.</p><p>The integration of the body, mind, and spirit.</p><p>The loving acceptance of ourselves today and the exciting free search for who we choose to become tomorrow.</p><p>Choice living; a compilation of the daily decisions we make that lead us to that person we choose to become.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2.People often think about wellness in terms of physical health — nutrition, exercise, weight management, etc., but it is so much more. Wellness is a holistic integration of physical, mental, and spiritual well-being, fueling the body, engaging the mind, and nurturing the spirit (1). Although it always includes striving for health, it’s more about living life fully (1), and is “a lifestyle and a personalized approach to living life in a way that… allows you to become the best kind of person that your potentials, circumstances, and fate will allow” (2).</p><p>Wellness necessitates good self-stewardship, for ourselves and for those we care about and who care about us. For those in the helping professions, such as ourselves in veterinary medicine, wellness is a professional as well as personal responsibility.</p><br />

                            24. Summarize the short essay below. This object, the camera, is very important nowadays since our generation is incredibly tech-savvy. It is very useful to those who are fond of capturing special moments. This object is also essential to people who are into photography and vlogging. In much earlier times, people had to draw or paint pictures just to have a copy, and it would take hours to achieve the desired results and be able to show it to others. But with a camera, it only takes a few clicks if your goal is to show someone how beautiful or unique something is. In a lot of ways, using a camera is like compiling research. Research serves as our tool for building knowledge and facilitating learning. It nourishes our minds and introduces to us new discoveries. A camera can also serve as a tool for preserving new discoveries and sharing them with others. Without the camera, ordinary people without artistic inclinations would not be able to do so.  ​</h2><br />

If you search online, most of the explanations focus on bringing down spikes that would overload medical facilities, leading to unnecessary deaths. However, the concept also applies to buying groceries, medical supplies ... While panic buying will empty shelves in stores and thereby creating the impression of shortages, there are large quantities sitting in warehouses waiting to be shipped to those stores.Source: https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/p/2020/03/19/covid-19-critiquing-newsreleases-whats-missing--teachable-opportunitiesWhat type of work is being critiqued?A.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</h2><br />
