                                            Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. questions:1. What do you think is the stand of the author? Is s/he for or against the implementation of SHS? Justify your answer. 2. What is the central claim of the text? 3. Who do you think is the target reader of the text? Why? 4. What was currently happening when the text was written? What prompted the author to write the text? 5. Do you think there is sufficient and valid evidence against and for SHS? Justify your answer. 6. Based on your own experience, should SHS continue to be implemented?​</a>

For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp; Writing for Senior High School.

The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>

To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented.10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>

                        Jeepney Phase-out as Modernization of Public Transport in the Philippines<br /><br />The Jeepney Phase-out as a modernization of public transport in the Philippines has been a topic of debate in recent years. While some argue that the phase-out is necessary to improve the country's transportation system, others believe that it will have negative effects on both the drivers and passengers. In this essay, I will argue that the Jeepney Phase-out is a necessary step towards modernizing public transport in the Philippines, and that the benefits of modernization outweigh the drawbacks.<br />the Jeepney Phase-out will lead to a more efficient and safer transportation system. Jeepneys are often poorly maintained and lack safety features such as seat belts, which puts passengers at risk. The phase-out will replace these old vehicles with modern, safer and more environmentally friendly options. Moreover, modernizing public transport can also lessen the traffic congestion which is a major problem in the country. This can be achieved by using alternative modes of transportation such as buses, trains and e-jeepneys.the modernization of public transport will also provide job opportunities for the affected jeepney drivers. The government has promised to provide financial assistance to the jeepney drivers who will be affected by the phase-out, and it is also offering training programs for them to learn how to operate the new vehicles. Furthermore, the modernization will also lead to the creation of new jobs such as mechanics, engineers, and drivers for the new vehicles.the Jeepney Phase-out can also have environmental benefits. The new vehicles will be more fuel-efficient and will emit less pollution which can help improve air quality in the country. This is especially important in urban areas where air pollution is a major health concern.the Jeepney Phase-out as modernization of public transport in the Philippines may have some negative effects in the short term, but the benefits in the long term outweigh the drawbacks. It will provide a safer, more efficient, and environmentally friendly transportation system for the country. The government must ensure that the affected jeepney drivers are properly compensated and given the necessary training to operate the new vehicles. Modernizing public transport in the Philippines is a necessary step towards achieving a more sustainable future for the country.<br /><br />

                            7. Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. questions:1. What do you think is the stand of the author?

Based on your own experience, should SHS continue to be implemented?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. The author's stand on the implementation of SHS is not clear from the given text. While the author presents both the commendable intention and the concerns of critics, the text does not explicitly state whether the author is for or against the implementation of SHS.</strong></p><p><strong>2. The central claim of the text is that the implementation of the K to 12 Program in the Philippines, particularly the addition of two years of Senior High School (SHS), has both positive and negative effects on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>3. The target reader of the text is likely to be educators, policymakers, and the general public who are interested in the current state of education in the Philippines and the effects of the K to 12 Program on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>4. When the text was written, the implementation of the K to 12 Program, which adds two years of Senior High School (SHS) to the Philippines' educational system, was ongoing. The author discusses the program's aim, which includes providing students with more time to master concepts and skills, preparing them for higher education and middle-level skills development, and producing lifelong learners. The author also highlights some concerns and criticisms of the program, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, and the potential loss of revenues for colleges and universities. The author also notes that while some people criticize the implementation of SHS, others praise it, indicating that it is a controversial issue that has elicited different reactions from various stakeholders. The text aims to provide information about the implementation of the K to 12 Program and to present different perspectives on its effectiveness and impact.</strong></p><p><strong>5. The text presents both the positive and negative effects of the implementation of SHS. There are valid concerns raised by critics, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, as well as the potential revenue loss of colleges and universities. However, the DepEd is optimistic that these problems will be addressed, and some private educational associations commend the implementation of the K to 12 Program. Therefore, there is evidence both for and against SHS, and it is up to policymakers and stakeholders to carefully weigh these factors when making decisions about education reform.<br />6. The effectiveness of the implementation of SHS in the Philippines is a matter of ongoing debate, and opinions may vary depending on various factors, such as personal experiences, beliefs, and the current state of education in the country. Some people may argue that the additional two years of education provide students with more time to develop their skills and prepare for their future careers. On the other hand, others may argue that it is too long and puts a strain on students and their families, especially those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Based on my knowledge, I cannot make a definitive statement on whether SHS should continue to be implemented or not. However, it is essential to evaluate the implementation of SHS continually, monitor its effects, and address any issues that may arise to ensure that it benefits its stakeholders and achieves its intended goals.</strong></p><br />

To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</h2><br />

To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented.10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</h2><br />
