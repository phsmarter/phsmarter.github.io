                                            3.) The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles and the Saxons and made them slaves. The old English spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is pork, but the animal itself is known as a pig.4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects.Question: What is the topic sentence in paragraph 3? Select one: a. The old English spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. b. Then we must comprehend or understand how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue.c.

                                            what does this mean?Pope Francis again drives the point well. "... avoiding the use of plastic and paper, reducing water consumption, separating refuse, cooking only what can reasonably be consumed, showing care for other living beings, using public transport or car-pooling, planting trees, turning off unnecessary lights, or any number of other practice. All of these reflect a generous and worthy creativity which brings out the best in human beings. Reusing something instead of immediately discarding it, when done for the right reasons, can be an act of love which expresses our own dignity."​</a>

                                            analogy haveAn analogy shows the relationships between words. It states the likeness between two things that are otherwise unlike. Analogies may enable one to learn new words by recognizing the relationship between words.
Examples: English : language :: Mathematics : arithmetic
The above stated example vividly shows the connection between English and language and Mathematics and arithmetic. English is basically a subject that is focused on language while Mathematics deals primarily with arithmetic or num- bers.
The colon (:) is used to split the analogy into two parts. The first part is the left-hand side of the double colon, “English : Language,” while the second part is the right hand side, “Mathematics : Arithmetic.” Keep in mind that the first set of words presents a relationship that is the same or alike as the second set of words. One possible way to read or verbalize an analogy is like this example:
English is to language as Mathematics is to Arithmetic.
Analogies have varied types such as:
Synonyms – words possessing the same meaning
e.g. happy: joyful :: pretty: cute
Antonym – words opposite to each other in terms of meaning
e.g. huge: tiny :: hot: cold
Part and whole – where several objects comprise or make up a group
e. g. heart: circulatory :: lungs: respiratory
Characteristics – mostly comprises descriptions of items
e.g. smart: teacher :: board eraser: dusty
f. Function – shows what a certain object is for or explains its use
e.g. keyboard: type :: stove: cook
e. Cause and Effect – showing cause-and-effect relationship
e.g. study: graduate :: hard work: success

                                            An analogy shows the relationships between words. It states the likeness between two things that are otherwise unlike. Analogies may enable one to learn new words by recognizing the relationship between words.
Examples: English : language :: Mathematics : arithmetic
The above stated example vividly shows the connection between English and language and Mathematics and arithmetic. English is basically a subject that is focused on language while Mathematics deals primarily with arithmetic or num- bers.
The colon (:) is used to split the analogy into two parts. The first part is the left-hand side of the double colon, “English : Language,” while the second part is the right hand side, “Mathematics : Arithmetic.” Keep in mind that the first set of words presents a relationship that is the same or alike as the second set of words. One possible way to read or verbalize an analogy is like this example:
English is to language as Mathematics is to Arithmetic.
Analogies have varied types such as:
Synonyms – words possessing the same meaning
e.g. happy: joyful :: pretty: cute
Antonym – words opposite to each other in terms of meaning
e.g. huge: tiny :: hot: cold
Part and whole – where several objects comprise or make up a group
e. g. heart: circulatory :: lungs: respiratory
Characteristics – mostly comprises descriptions of items
e.g. smart: teacher :: board eraser: dusty
f. Function – shows what a certain object is for or explains its use
e.g. keyboard: type :: stove: cook
e. Cause and Effect – showing cause-and-effect relationship
e.g. study: graduate :: hard work: success

                                            Reality TV shows are good entertainment Reality shows are a very popular forma di entertainment on TV sodass These are dozens of different types of programmes such as gng contests. cooking competitions or going to live in the jungle. about Firstly, I think that there is a lot of variety in reality TV. People at home can choose which types of programme they want to watch depending on what they are interested in. Some people like watching, singang, or cooking competitions while others prefer watching programmes building houses or travelling around the world. In addition, reality TV programmes are a great opportunity to discover talented singers, dancers, or chefs. Several people who take part in these programmes get jobs as a results being on TV. Another advantage is that the people on the shows have interesting experiences and meet new people. On the other hand, some people think that reality TV is an easy way for them to become famous. However, most succesful singers, actors or chefs have worked hard all their lives and are good at their job because of their bardwork. Also, sometimes the people on the shows have to do really difficult or dangerous things. The competitions are very hard and there is only one winner. Another disadvantage is that some programmes always follow the same format and this can be boring to watch. To sum up, I think that reality TV is a good entertainment. There is a lot of variety which means there is something for everyone and they are interesting to watch. What is being talked about in the text? Do you agree/disagree with this?

                                            Origins of the English Language1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times.2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the  Saxons, into Great  Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became  the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday).3) Then we must comprehend or understand   how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles   and the Saxons and made them   slaves. The old English spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words   helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use   the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of   England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended  the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is  pork, but the animal itself  is known as a pig.4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced  all the way  back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”.5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.Question: Which statement is true based on the definition from the passage?Select one:a.Pig is a French word, meaning a live animal.b.Porcis a French word, meaning the flesh of a pig to be cooked and eaten.c.Conquer comes from the Latin roots, conquarere, meaning to win.d.all of the choices8 ko​</a>

                            7. what does this mean?Pope Francis again drives the point well. "... avoiding the use of plastic and paper, reducing water consumption, separating refuse, cooking only what can reasonably be consumed, showing care for other living beings, using public transport or car-pooling, planting trees, turning off unnecessary lights, or any number of other practice. All of these reflect a generous and worthy creativity which brings out the best in human beings. Reusing something instead of immediately discarding it, when done for the right reasons, can be an act of love which expresses our own dignity."​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is discussing the importance of taking care of the environment and the ways in which individuals can make a positive impact. Pope Francis is stating that by taking small actions such as reducing the use of plastic and paper, conserving water, recycling, being mindful of food consumption, being considerate of other living beings, using public transportation, planting trees, turning off lights when not needed and other actions, people can demonstrate their creativity and show that they care about the environment. He also suggests that these actions can be acts of love and that they reflect the dignity of individuals.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            8. analogy haveAn analogy shows the relationships between words. It states the likeness between two things that are otherwise unlike. Analogies may enable one to learn new words by recognizing the relationship between words.
Examples: English : language :: Mathematics : arithmetic
The above stated example vividly shows the connection between English and language and Mathematics and arithmetic. English is basically a subject that is focused on language while Mathematics deals primarily with arithmetic or num- bers.
The colon (:) is used to split the analogy into two parts. The first part is the left-hand side of the double colon, “English : Language,” while the second part is the right hand side, “Mathematics : Arithmetic.” Keep in mind that the first set of words presents a relationship that is the same or alike as the second set of words. One possible way to read or verbalize an analogy is like this example:
English is to language as Mathematics is to Arithmetic.
Analogies have varied types such as:
Synonyms – words possessing the same meaning
e.g. happy: joyful :: pretty: cute
Antonym – words opposite to each other in terms of meaning
e.g. huge: tiny :: hot: cold
Part and whole – where several objects comprise or make up a group
e. g. heart: circulatory :: lungs: respiratory
Characteristics – mostly comprises descriptions of items
e.g. smart: teacher :: board eraser: dusty
f. Function – shows what a certain object is for or explains its use
e.g. keyboard: type :: stove: cook
e. Cause and Effect – showing cause-and-effect relationship
e.g. study: graduate :: hard work: success

Reality TV shows are good entertainment Reality shows are a very popular forma di entertainment on TV sodass These are dozens of different types of programmes such as gng contests. cooking competitions or going to live in the jungle. about Firstly, I think that there is a lot of variety in reality TV. People at home can choose which types of programme they want to watch depending on what they are interested in. Some people like watching, singang, or cooking competitions while others prefer watching programmes building houses or travelling around the world. In addition, reality TV programmes are a great opportunity to discover talented singers, dancers, or chefs. Several people who take part in these programmes get jobs as a results being on TV. Another advantage is that the people on the shows have interesting experiences and meet new people. On the other hand, some people think that reality TV is an easy way for them to become famous. However, most succesful singers, actors or chefs have worked hard all their lives and are good at their job because of their bardwork. Also, sometimes the people on the shows have to do really difficult or dangerous things. The competitions are very hard and there is only one winner. Another disadvantage is that some programmes always follow the same format and this can be boring to watch. To sum up, I think that reality TV is a good entertainment. There is a lot of variety which means there is something for everyone and they are interesting to watch. What is being talked about in the text? Do you agree/disagree with this?

                            27. Origins of the English Language1) In starting our study of the English language, we must know something about its beginnings or origins. The English language has its beginnings in many other languages that go far back into ancient times.2) We must start our study as far back as the invasion of two German tribes, the Angles and the  Saxons, into Great  Britain. This invasion occurred about four hundred years after the birth of Christ. These barbaric tribes overran the island of Great Britain and introduced a new way of life. They also introduced new words into the language that later became  the English we speak and write today. From their Germanic gods, for example, come the days of the week: Tui, the god of war (Tuesday); Woden, father of the gods (Wednesday); Thor, god of Thunder (Thursday).3) Then we must comprehend or understand   how the invasion of the Normans into Great Britain- known as the land of the Angles, or England – also changed our mother tongue. The Normans were from France. In 1066 they conquered the Angles   and the Saxons and made them   slaves. The old English spoken by the Angles and Saxons survived; however, some French words were added. These new words   helped to make our language richer. From these early Frenchmen, for example, the word porc means “pig”. Today, we use   the word pork, however, only when we speak of the flesh of a pig. This is because the early French Normans, as the masters of   England, saw the animal only when it was cooked and served to them on the dinner table. The Angle and Saxon slaves, however, who tended  the animal while it was alive, called it pig. So even now the flesh of this particular animal when eaten is  pork, but the animal itself  is known as a pig.4) And, in turn, we must understand or comprehend how the French language brought to England by the Norman conquerors had its roots in the ancient languages of Greece and Rome. Many of the words borrowed from the Normans at this time, for example showed the relationship of a ruling class to its subjects. Most of these words can be traced  all the way  back to Latin. The word conqueror itself comes from the old French word conquerre which, in turn, comes from the Latin word conquarere, which simply means “to win”.5) Only by a brief study of these chronological events and their influences can we comprehend why the English language we speak today is so rich in meaning.Question: Which statement is true based on the definition from the passage?Select one:a.Pig is a French word, meaning a live animal.b.Porcis a French word, meaning the flesh of a pig to be cooked and eaten.c.Conquer comes from the Latin roots, conquarere, meaning to win.d.all of the choices8 ko​</h2><br />
