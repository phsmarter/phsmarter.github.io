Directions: Respond to the following questions based on the given excerpt from the literary text entitled Literature of Myanmar In the fifteenth century up to the nineteenth century, palm-leaf (scratched with a stylus) and folded-paper literature became common. Such works were filled with Buddhist piety and courtly refinement of language. The authors were monks, educated courtiers, and court . poetesses. Prose works during this period were few, mostly Buddhist scriptures and chronicles of kings. Poetry was varied: there were historical ballads, panegyric odes, the pyo (Buddhist story in verse), and the ya-du (poems of love or nature). The writers also used the mixed style or prose and poetry together. Examples of this are the Yagan, a serio-comic epic, and the Myil- Ta-za, a letter of an abbot to the king. 1. In the reading text, what are the things that reflect the shared heritages of the people of Myanmar? List down at least three of them. 2. What can you say about Burmese literature?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>B. Someone who lost a job because of the pandemic and now doing a new different work</p><p></p><p>The pandemic has greatly affected many people's jobs and livelihoods, and it's heartbreaking to hear about people losing their jobs due to circumstances beyond their control. It's difficult to adjust to sudden changes, especially when it affects your source of income and stability.</p><p></p><p>However, I am inspired by the resilience and adaptability of people who lost their jobs but managed have to find new work. It takes courage to start over and try something new, especially when it's not in your field of expertise or interest. It's admirable to see people making the best out of a tough situation, despite the challenges and uncertainties that come with it.</p><p></p><p>I believe that every experience, even the difficult ones, can be an opportunity for growth and learning. Losing a job can be a chance to reassess your life and career goals, and to explore new possibilities that you might not have considered before. It can also be a time to develop new skills, meet new people, and broaden your perspective.</p><p></p><p>As someone who has also experienced job loss and career changes, I know how hard it can be. But I also know that with determination, hard work, and a positive attitude, it's possible to overcome the challenges and find new opportunities. We just need to stay hopeful, keep an open mind, and be willing to take risks and try new things.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, I am inspired by the resilience of people who lost their jobs due to the pandemic, and I believe that every challenge can be an opportunity for growth and learning. Let us support and encourage each other to adapt and thrive in the face of adversity.</p><br />

Directions: Respond to the following questions based on the given excerpt from the literary text entitled Literature of Myanmar In the fifteenth century up to the nineteenth century, palm-leaf (scratched with a stylus) and folded-paper literature became common. Such works were filled with Buddhist piety and courtly refinement of language. The authors were monks, educated courtiers, and court . poetesses. Prose works during this period were few, mostly Buddhist scriptures and chronicles of kings. Poetry was varied: there were historical ballads, panegyric odes, the pyo (Buddhist story in verse), and the ya-du (poems of love or nature). The writers also used the mixed style or prose and poetry together. Examples of this are the Yagan, a serio-comic epic, and the Myil- Ta-za, a letter of an abbot to the king. 1.
