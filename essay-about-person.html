                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>English version:</strong><p>Aswangs or monsters are in the Philippines and they are also part of the Filipino culture is our superstitious beliefs. We have a lot of superstitions in the Philippines and they include the belief in creatures we call “Aswang”. In other countries in the world has stories about mermaids, vampires, werewolves,  zombies, while the Philippines keep the superstitious culture by telling stories about Aswang. </p><p></p><strong>Tagalog version:</strong><p> Bahagi ng kulturang Pilipino ang ating mga pamahiin. Marami tayong mga pamahiin sa Pilipinas at kabilang dito ang paniniwala sa mga nilalang na tinatawag nating “Aswang”. Ang mundo ay may mga kwento tungkol sa mga sirena, bampira, werewolves, zombies, habang pinapanatili ng Pilipinas ang mapamahiing kultura sa pamamagitan ng pagkukuwento tungkol sa aswang.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po ok lang kung ayaw po ninyo pero hope this helps</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Aswang, a creature steeped in Philippine folklore, has always fascinated me. This shape-shifting being is said to transform from a human form to that of a monster, often a bloodthirsty vampire or werewolf. The Aswang is a popular subject in Philippine horror stories and movies, and its legend has been passed down through generations.</p><p></p><p>Growing up in the Philippines, I heard countless tales of the Aswang from my grandparents and other family members. They would tell me of how the Aswang would sneak into homes at night to steal infants, or how it would assume the form of a beautiful woman to lure unsuspecting men to their doom. The stories were always chilling and left a deep impression on me.</p><p></p><p>As I grew older, I became interested in the cultural significance of the Aswang. I learned that it is often used as a metaphor for the darker side of human nature, representing the evil that lurks within us all. The Aswang is a reminder to be vigilant against the temptations of greed, envy, and violence.</p><p></p><p>The Aswang is also a symbol of colonialism and oppression. In the past, Spanish colonizers used the fear of the Aswang to control and subjugate the indigenous people of the Philippines. They would spread rumors of Aswang attacks to justify brutal crackdowns on the local population.</p><p></p><p>Despite the dark connotations associated with the Aswang, I find it to be a captivating and important part of Philippine culture. It serves as a reminder of the importance of facing our fears and overcoming the darker aspects of our nature. Aswang stories also remind us of the importance of preserving and passing down our cultural heritage.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the Aswang is a creature of Philippine folklore that has always fascinated me. It serves as a reminder of the darker aspects of human nature and the importance of facing our fears and overcoming them. It also serves as a symbol of colonialism and oppression, and the importance of preserving our cultural heritage. The Aswang will always be an important part of Philippine culture and will continue to captivate the imagination of many generations to come.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I believe in the beauty of mathematics. I do not see mathematics as a cold and impersonal set of immutable laws; I believe in her beauty. I see the infinite union of logic and human ingenuity she represents. I see her as the universal language shared throughout all of mankind. I see mathematics as elegance and beauty in their purest forms.</p><p></p><p>Like learning a language, mathematics can be extremely mechanical and tedious. However, for those who have the dedication to master its nuances and the meaning behind her arbitrary numbers, the subject transcends the infamous impersonal identity. No longer is she the notorious immovable block of stone impeding their education as described by bitter students. She becomes a fluid river whose course is affected by the ideas of mankind. She becomes a brush wielded by the mind to paint a portrait of logic that has been in constant design since the dawn of our existence – a portrait that tells our species’ tale of struggling to understand the observable universe.</p><p></p><p></p>#carryOnLearning#i'mhappytohelp#lovelots<p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:  As we may already know, Aristotle's account of the human person as an embodied spirit is in large part a reaction against Plato's take on the nature of the human person. For Plato, the nature of the human person is seen in the metaphysical dichotomy between body and soul.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Aspects of an individual's personality, notably his or her optimism and perceived personal control over life events, can contribute to a positive health attitude as well. Highly optimistic people and those with high perceived control consistently view their health more positively and cope more successfully with health problems, than do highly pessimistic people and those with low perceived control. Finally, the way people explain a health-related event can affect how positively they view their health. </p><p>When negative events happen (heart attack), people who attribute the event to a stable cause (genetic makeup) will view their health prospects more negatively than do people who attribute the event to an unstable cause (e.g., unhealthy lifestyle). Such characteristic attributions may account for the effects of dispositions such as optimism or perceived control on health attitudes. Moreover, according to research in achievement settings, these attributions may be subject to psychotherapeutic intervention, suggesting one way in which people can adopt a positive health attitude. It remains unclear, however, whether such induced attitudes convey the same protection as those that occur spontaneously.</p><p>Positive health attitudes have been associated with mostly desirable health-related consequences, as assessed at a later time. Other circumstances being equal, people who view their health positively live longer, on average, than people who view their health negatively. However, a positive health attitude can also serve a defensive function, leading to undesirable consequences. People may continue a health-damaging behavior, such as smoking, or fail to adopt a health-enhancing one, such as sunscreen use because their positive health attitude shields them from recognizing the health threat that these choices may pose. Finally, one's health attitude can serve a symbolic function, by reaffirming the increasing value people place on their health as they age.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Many times, high school students are told not to use first person (“I,” “we,” “my,” “us,” and so forth) in their essays. As a college student, you should realize that this is a rule that can and should be broken—at the right time. However, academic essays differ from personal essays; they are typically researched and use a formal tone. Because of these differences, when students write an academic essay, they quickly shy away from first person because of what they have been told in high school or because they believe that first person feels too informal for an intellectual, researched text. While first person can definitely be overused in academic essays (which is likely why your teachers tell you not to use it), there are moments in a paper when it is not only appropriate, but also more effective and/or persuasive to use first person. The following are a few instances in which it is appropriate to use first person in an academic essay.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Money controls everything these days so by learning about money and how to handle it I have learned more about life than I thought going into this course. I did not choose to take this class; the counselor chose it for me. I honestly came into this class just wanting to get it over with and earn my credits. But as the class progressed, I started to realize just how valuable the material is. You need money for pretty much every aspect of your life and there is no getting around that. I personally prefer to prepared for things rather than regretting it later when I face the consequences that a little preparation could have avoided. In this class, I found a few topics to stick out more than the others. Spending money, banking, and retirement are three things that pertain to my particular lifestyle, so these are the topics I have chosen to discuss.</p><p></p><br />

                            25. essay about personal ideas on the nature of man​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The nature of man is a complex and multi-faceted topic that has been debated by philosophers and thinkers for centuries. In my personal opinion, the nature of man is a combination of both innate and acquired characteristics that shape our behavior and actions.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, I believe that man has an innate capacity for both good and evil. From a young age, we possess the ability to empathize with others and exhibit compassion, as well as the ability to engage in destructive or harmful behavior. The balance of these opposing forces within us is determined by our upbringing, experiences, and the society in which we live.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, I believe that the nature of man is shaped by the environment and experiences. Our upbringing, family dynamics, education, and the culture we are raised in all play a significant role in shaping our beliefs, values, and behavior. Our experiences also shape us, through the lessons we learn and the decisions we make.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, I believe that man has the ability to change and evolve over time. We are not defined by our past actions or experiences, but rather have the ability to reflect on them, learn from them, and make conscious choices to change our behavior for the better.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the nature of man is a complex and dynamic concept that is shaped by both innate characteristics and the environment. While we possess the ability for both good and evil, we also have the ability to change and evolve over time. It is important to recognize and understand these different factors in order to create a more compassionate and just society.</p><br />

                            27. Write an essay about your IDEAL PERSON</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>My Ideal Person Essay</strong><p>Human beings are not perfect. We all have some form of deficiency that deny us the coveted tag of perfection. It may be a character flaw or a physical disability. We all have something that we are not proud of. Something that makes us so uncomfortable that our confidence levels plummet to zero whenever we think about it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>While there are things we cannot change about ourselves, such as height, intelligence, race or size of our fingers, there are other factors in our lives that we can change and they are the ones that really matter. We are not remembered for our tallness or brownness, we are remembered for our virtues or vices. Therefore, an ideal person is one who possesses all character traits that are considered virtues in society.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When I talk about an ideal person, one person comes to mind- Mother Teresa. Her name has become synonymous with sacrifice and selfless generosity. People know her from all over the world, both in the religious and secular circles. Though she was not perfect, her life embodied what I would refer to as the ideal personality. One of her best qualities was piety. She was a very faithful and religious woman.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Mother Teresa was a staunch catholic. At the tender age of 18 years, she joined the Sisters of Loreto in Dublin and became a nun. She therefore dedicated all her life towards a religious and humanitarian course and never looked back. There were instances where she felt like God had forgotten her and even questioned whether God really existed. However, she never left her catholic faith.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She was also very generous. She spent most of her life serving the poor. Form her own account, which she labeled as “a call within a call,” God spoke to her and commanded her to go help the slum dwellers in Calcutta, India. After receiving approval from Vatican, she relocated to Calcutta for the rest of her life. Using her meagre resources, she wholeheartedly helped the poor and the sick.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She left behind a lifestyle of stability and opulence, took a vow of charity, chastity and poverty and then went to a foreign country to live with the destitute. During her life, she suffered from many illnesses and injuries, including malaria, pneumonia and two heart attacks. She also had broken collar bone. The several setbacks she faced however did not deter her from moving on with her course.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Mother Teresa was also a leader and she led by example. When she saw things were not okay and people were suffering, she took it upon herself to help them. With all the poverty and misery that surrounded her, she always had the strength to put on a smile. One of the traits of great leaders is that they always give people hope when there seems to be none.</p><p></p><p></p><p>That was Mother Teresa. People rushed to her for comfort and assistance and she always found a way to help them. When she arrived in Calcutta, there was wide spread of diseases in the slums. She went to a medical institution, trained to be practitioner and went back to the slums to treat the affected. She also established various health centers to deal with the rampant spread of diseases, including leprosy that was wreaking havoc in the slums.</p><p></p><p>She was also very principled. She had her own set of beliefs that she followed to the letter and never faltered whenever she faced criticism or opposition. She openly opposed divorce, abortion and contraception. While receiving her Nobel Peace Prize for her unwavering service to humanity, she aired her critique on abortion without fear. She opined in her speech, “…I feel the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a direct war- a direct murder by the mother herself…” Although she received too much public backlash for her stance on abortion, contraception and divorce, she was unperturbed and made it clear to the whole world about her position.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It can feel terrible when you unintentionally offend someone.  It can happen in marriage, with friends, or at work.  It can even happen with people we don’t know well.  It happens to everyone at some point or another.</p><p></p><p>None of us want to be responsible for someone feeling hurt or angry.  Handled poorly, it creates conflict, guilt, or ill-will for both people involved.  However, if you can use kindness and healthy communication, your mistakes may have the remarkable potential to strengthen your  relationship, particularly if you are able to be gracious and respectful in your approach.</p><br />
