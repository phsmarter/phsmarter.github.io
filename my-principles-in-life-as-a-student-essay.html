                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My area has just become one of the most infected areas of my state. Things are much different than they used to be. I defiantly feel the panic from others as grocery stores sellout of things like toilet paper or bottled water. I feel the panic from our leaders, who have put policy in place to hopefully end this virus in the near future. I think the reaction is appropriate and I appreciate everything that people are doing to help stop the spread, no matter how boring it may be.
</p><p>
</p><p>I can confidently say that my life has indeed changed. I am a senior in high school, and this was not how I was planning to spend my senior year. Every day I wake up and “go” to online school. I do my work and then workout. I eat at the times we normally would eat. My routine is extremely repetitive, and we have only been doing this for a few weeks. I understand that we may have to do this for a long time, and I am fully willing to do so in hopes that we can return to normal soon.
</p><p>
</p><p>I think the biggest challenge for me has been realizing that I might never go to my high school again to thank the teachers who changed my life and finally graduate after waiting four long years. It is hard that I must make a college decision in a time like this, but I also understand that there are many people out there who are not in the same position I am at the moment, so I am grateful for my opportunities and my blessings. However, I do feel that there is good in this situation. I plan on going to college across the country, so I am glad I can spend time with my family before I leave. I believe that the future is uncertain going forward. I always ask myself if things will ever go back to what I consider “normal”. I hope that it will, and I hope that I will get the opportunity to do the things I want to do in my life. I think that there is something to be learned, but I just do not know what it is yet. I hope we can fight this together and come out stronger.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Student life is meant to help us learn discipline and study. Despite that, life is quite enjoyable. The struggle is low in student life. One must get up early in the morning to get ready for school or college. Similarly, rushing to the bus stop is very exciting during student life. The mothers constantly remind us to hurry up and not be late. It is no less than a mantra for all mothers.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In addition, there are other exciting moments in student life. We sometimes forget to complete our homework and then pretend to find the notebook when the teacher asks for it. With the examination time around the corner, the fun stops for a while but not long. One of the most exciting things about student life is getting to go on picnics and trips with your friends.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You get to enjoy yourself and have a  lot of fun. Even waiting for the exam result with friends becomes fun. The essence of student life lies in the little things like getting curious about your friend’s marks, getting jealous if they score more, and so on. The excitement for games period or learning about a new teacher. While student life teaches us discipline, it also gives us a lot of fun. It is a memorable time in everyone’s life.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Student life is a vital part of everyone’s life. The future of the students and the country depends on how we are as students. Thus, getting the right guidance is essential. Student life builds the foundation for our life. Thus, if your foundation is strong, the building will be a strong one too. However, a weak foundation cannot make a building stand. In other words, student life helps us embrace human qualities.</p><p></p><p></p><p>People don’t realize how lucky and privileged one is to even get a student life. Many children dream of having it but never get one. Thus, if one gets to attain education, one must make the most of it. Student life won’t always be filled with happiness but it will be worthwhile. It helps us grow in the path of life and acquire qualities such as honesty, patience, perseverance, and more.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Student life is one of the most memorable phases of a person's life. The phase of student life builds the foundation of our life. In student life, we do not just learn from books. We learn to grow emotionally, physically, philosophically as well as socially. Student life is the best phase of life which is like a complete roller coaster full of ups and downs . The only thing students are scared are of grades or superiority or being famous that's all. </p><p></p><p></p><p>All in all, student life is no less than perfect. Even though it has many ups and downs, it is all worth it in the end. Our student life determines a lot of things in our lives later on. Therefore, we must strive to be good students not just academically but also in other aspects. It is like a backbone to have a successful life later on.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I am a person who has experienced various obstacles throughout my life. These obstacles have not only helped me grow as an individual, but they have also shaped who I am today. Growing up, I struggled with self-esteem and confidence issues due to being bullied in school. This made me feel insecure and hesitant to express myself around others. However, with time, I learned to overcome these challenges and build a more positive self-image.</p><p></p><p>Another obstacle that I have faced is financial hardship. Growing up in a low-income family, I have had to work hard to achieve my goals and dreams. I have always been determined to succeed and not let my circumstances hold me back. I worked hard in school and earned scholarships to help pay for college. This taught me the value of hard work and perseverance.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these challenges, I also struggled with anxiety and depression. It was difficult for me to talk about my emotions and seek help, but I knew that it was important to take care of my mental health. I found support through therapy, self-care practices, and building strong relationships with friends and family.</p><p></p><p>Despite these obstacles, I have been able to overcome them and achieve many accomplishments. I have earned a degree in my chosen field and have a fulfilling career. I have also developed strong interpersonal skills and am confident in myself and my abilities. </p><p></p><p>Looking back, I am grateful for the obstacles that I have faced as they have made me a stronger and more resilient person. These experiences have taught me to embrace challenges and to use them as opportunities for growth. I know that life will continue to bring obstacles, but I am confident in my ability to overcome them and continue to strive towards my goals.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>it's 5 paragraph.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>ANSWER:</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>You may dream big in life, but to achieve them, you must set long and short term goals. These goals will make you steady, taking a step at a time, without hastily jumping into all at once. For instance, I aspire to become a writer, and to make this possible, I need to graduate from a reputed institution.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone has a dream in his life which they want to achieve when they grow up. Some kids want to become rich so that they can buy anything and some want to be a doctor, lawyer, or engineer. But only you know that for achieving these goals you have to work hard and stay attentive to it. In this essay on my dream, we are going to discuss the basic things that will help in achieving my dream.</p><p></p><p><strong>M</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong> </strong><strong>D</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>M</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong> </strong><strong>L</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>-</strong>essay</p><p></p><p><strong>Determination</strong></p><p>For turning a dream into reality the first thing that you need is determination. This will help you in a lot of ways. Firstly, it will help you decide the course of action for doing anything. Besides, it will also help you to plan the journey ahead. Also, it will help to take things slow and maintain a steady pace towards the dream.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, no matter how big my dream planning and setting short term goals will always help. This is important because rushing to your dream will not going to help you in any way. Besides, there is some dream that requires time and they follow a process without following it you cannot achieve that dream.</p><p></p><p><strong>Staying Motivated</strong></p><p>Lack of motivation is one of the main causes that force a person to leave his dream behind. So, staying motivated is also part of the goal. And if you can’t stay positive then you won’t be able to achieve the dream. There are many people out there that quit the journey of their dreams mid-way because they lack motivation.</p><p></p><p><strong>Keep Remembering Goal</strong></p><p>For completing the dream you have to keep your dream in the mind. And remind this dream to yourself daily. There come hard times when you feel like quitting at those times just remember the goal it helps you stay positive. And if you feel like you messed up big times then start over with a fresh mind.</p><p></p><p><strong>Reward Yourself</strong></p><p>You don’t need to cover milestones to reward yourself. Set a small target towards your dream and on fulfilling them reward yourself. These rewards can be anything from toffee to your favorite thing. Besides, this is a good way of self-motivation</p><p></p><p><strong>Take Some Breaks</strong></p><p>Working towards your goal not mean that you work day and night without stopping. Apart from that, due to continuous efforts, people soon start to become de-motivated. So, taking a break will help your body and mind. For doing so, take a break in between your schedule for some time an engage yourself in other activities.</p><p></p><p><strong>Stay Among Positive People</strong></p><p>Your company affects you in a lot of ways than you can imagine. So, be with people who appreciate you and stay away from people who distract and criticize you.</p><p></p><p><strong>Don’t Hesitate to Make Mistakes</strong></p><p>We human beings fear to make mistakes but with it, we forget an important point that is a mistake helps us to learn. Whenever you make a mistake you face a tough time but these tough times helps you to polish yourself and be more determinant.</p><p></p><p>To sum it up, we can say that dreaming of a goal is far easier than achieving it. And for fulfilling your dream you need a lot of things and also have to sacrifice many things.</p><p></p><p>Above all, for fulfilling your dream plan and work according to it because it will lead you to the right path. And never forget to dream big because they help in overcoming every obstacle in life.</p><p> </p><p>:)</p><br />

                        <p>Life is a complex and multifaceted journey that lasts from birth until death. We experience a range of emotions, learn lessons, and make connections with others. It is precious and should be cherished and appreciated. Meanwhile, we are faced with positive and negative experiences that shape our growth as individuals. There are breathtaking moments that remind us of the beauty and wonder of the world, as well as difficult times that test our strength and resilience. Life can be joyous, sorrowful, triumphant and full of adversity; all at once. Nevertheless, it is a journey worth taking and every moment should be treasured.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>We all do things in life that we regret. We also do things in life that make us proud of the people that we are. Still, there are things in life that we hope to someday be able to do. All of these things make up who we are and how we've come to be ourselves. Occasionally we'd like to change the past because of regrets, though this would completely change who we are.</p><p>             The past few years have been very trying for me. A lot of events had taken place, and sent me down a road I should never have gone down. The events themselves need not be spoken of; the affects that occurred due to them are the focal point. I had become severely depressed. I could have cared less about what anyone thought of me or what would happen to me. I became careless in my everyday decisions that should have come easy to me. My friendships suffered, my relationships suffered, as well as my career as a student. Because of these things, my parents became more and more persistent with me, which only led me to run away from home. Shortly after, I was found and forced to return home, regardless of my reasons for doing so.</p><p></p><p>Now, I can say that I have turned my life around. Some things from the past few years still haunt me to this day, but I'm able to cope with them thanks to the help I received from people who do care about me. I have been going to school on as much of a regular basis as possible considering my low immune system, I'm doing my school work, I've become social again, and rekindled the bonds between my friends and myself.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>hope you understand ❣️</p><br />

                        The effects of the COVID-19 panic has caused a massive changes to our daily lives, changes that have often happened rapidly and abruptly. Life adjustments often come with a wide range of experiences and emotions. Sometimes that transition can feel smooth and other times that journey to the new normal is choppy or downright bumpy!<br /><br />Some people may find themselves in survival mode, gathering information and resources necessary to function at school, work, as a person, and in our relationships with others. Others may be attempting to settle into their new routines. For some, this means trying to combat social isolation. For many, it means learning how to live (or re-live) with friends, family members, partners, or roommates, which is not always easy. I hear a lot of people struggle to find a distraction-free space at home that is conducive to do productive and effective work. For myself, I feel like it takes twice as much time, effort, and energy to do even simple tasks, which can be quite draining. I’ve really had to be very compassionate and patient with myself lately. Others may be struggling with the fatigue, frustration, sadness, anger, grief, and anxiety (among other things) of adjusting. Some people (and I hope there are a lot of you out there), have gone through the adjustment process and are finding comfort in your new norm. In all of this, here are a few important things to remember.<br /><br />This situation is both uncertain and temporary! It’s okay not to feel okay. It’s also okay (and encouraged) to seek help and support!<br />Consider this a time to reflect on who you want to be during this time.<br />Focus on what is within your control.<br />It’s good to be informed, and it’s a really good idea to take breaks from conversations, news, and information related to COVID-19.<br />Adjustment is a process that looks differently for most people. This process is not liner or well-defined. Patience and flexibility are really important.<br />Please be respectful of where you are in the process (some self-compassion can go a long way) and also of where others are.<br />It’s okay to be curious about where your friends, family, and others are in their process and to seek to understand their wants and needs at this time. Don’t forget to tell them what you want and need too!<br />Setting a routine can be really helpful! In addition to doing your schoolwork make sure to schedule time for your physical and emotional health, fun, creatively, social connection, and stress relief!<br />It’s okay to set boundaries, even with family members, friends, and professors.<br />I hope that when reading this you are beginning to see that you aren’t alone in the adjustment process. My wish for you is that you have found some peace in the chaos, and learned something about yourself and the world around you.<br /><br />Pa brainliest po pls <br />Thank you sa points <br />

I hear a lot of people struggle to find a distraction-free space at home that is conducive to do productive and effective work. For myself, I feel like it takes twice as much time, effort, and energy to do even simple tasks, which can be quite draining. I’ve really had to be very compassionate and patient with myself lately. Others may be struggling with the fatigue, frustration, sadness, anger, grief, and anxiety (among other things) of adjusting. Some people (and I hope there are a lot of you out there), have gone through the adjustment process and are finding comfort in your new norm. In all of this, here are a few important things to remember.<br /><br />This situation is both uncertain and temporary! It’s okay not to feel okay. It’s also okay (and encouraged) to seek help and support!<br />Consider this a time to reflect on who you want to be during this time.<br />Focus on what is within your control.<br />It’s good to be informed, and it’s a really good idea to take breaks from conversations, news, and information related to COVID-19.<br />Adjustment is a process that looks differently for most people. This process is not liner or well-defined. Patience and flexibility are really important.<br />Please be respectful of where you are in the process (some self-compassion can go a long way) and also of where others are.<br />It’s okay to be curious about where your friends, family, and others are in their process and to seek to understand their wants and needs at this time. Don’t forget to tell them what you want and need too!<br />Setting a routine can be really helpful! In addition to doing your schoolwork make sure to schedule time for your physical and emotional health, fun, creatively, social connection, and stress relief!<br />It’s okay to set boundaries, even with family members, friends, and professors.<br />I hope that when reading this you are beginning to see that you aren’t alone in the adjustment process. My wish for you is that you have found some peace in the chaos, and learned something about yourself and the world<br />
