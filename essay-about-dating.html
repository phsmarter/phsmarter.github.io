                        <p> </p><p></p>      Dating at A Young Age<p></p><p>Love is a potent emotion and it is easy to be judgemental about teenage love, dismiss it as ‘puppy love’ and not the so-called real thing since a body and mind as yet undeveloped and unmatured, to process the complexities and intricacies of such an evolved and onerous emotion, is as yet unprepared.</p><p></p><p>The power of love is infinite. It can lead, inspire and turn ordinary folks into poets, writers, artists and muses. It can make the most laid back of us plod to the end of the earth to attain the impossible but such kind of love needs time, passion and concerted effort to make it work. Youngsters who are still grappling with the rapid changes in their own mind, body and hormones need time to figure this out and any haste might lead to a lot of setbacks, heartbreak, anxiety related disorders, dip in academic performance, a dilution of their career goals and in worst of circumstances lifelong scars.</p><p></p><p>With the onslaught of internet, young minds are exposed, before time to love,sex and passion. Getting in and out of relationships has become more of a contest between peers rather an organic process of falling in love. Where the tag of being single invites derision, humiliation even ridicule, it is not surprising to find youngsters keen to jump into the bandwagon of dating, just to keep pace with their friends, throwing all good sense and caution to the winds.</p><p></p><p>Their minds who have yet to realise the profundity of this emotion, fails to sift out love from a mere attraction towards opposite sex. Too many heartbreaks and separationslater, they might be wiser but unnecessarily scarred. Their minds, which is yet evolving, is not equipped to churn out logical, sane responses to bubbling emotions and jealousy, over-possessiveness and dejection may make them prone to over-anxiety, depression, violent outbursts , even suicidal contemplations.</p><p></p><p>Their emotional ineptitude makes them unaware of how resilient the heart can be. Where every dejection seems to be an assault f their identity, where every break-up might seem catastrophic, where every new attraction might seem the love of one’s life, dating on a one-to-one basis, at such a tender age is bound to have serious ramification, if unguided and unsupported.</p><p></p><p>Where the only emotion which makes the world go round seems to be love for the opposite sex, an entire chunk of growing up phase is deeply compromised. Camaraderie with friends, bonding with parents, rapport with siblings, relationships with mentors take a backseat and some very beautiful moments of growing up phase in life is left  unformed and incomplete. Academic performance is bound to suffer in the wake such major emotional and mental upheavals and career goals compromised.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            7. Make an essay about the significance of Absolute and Relative dating in land surfaces for landscaping processes​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The dating of land surfaces has long posed problems for geomorphologists. Relative methods (stratigraphic, geomorphic, topographic) are sound and convincing. Exhumed forms may complicate identification and relationships, for both epigene and etch forms have been buried, and exhumed, but in tectonically undisturbed areas, the higher surfaces are older than those preserved at lower levels. Also, surfaces have an age range. The relationship of surfaces with volcanic deposits, old shorelines, and genetically related sedimentary sequences provides sound ages, and correlation with dated duricrusts and faults is also useful. There are no temporal limits to relative dating, for the methods are equally applicable to the dating, say, of Proterozoic surfaces as of those of Pleistocene age. The disadvantage of such methods is that the necessary evidence is frequently either not preserved or not exposed.The so-called ‘absolute’ (physical, numerical) methods, and especially those based on exposure age dating with in situ cosmogenic radionuclides, are appealing because they produce direct numerical ages, and appear to be widely applicable, but there are severe temporal limitations, and sampling problems complicate, and may invalidate, interpretation. Absolute age determinations must be consistent with the stratigraphic and geomorphologic settings. The best results are obtained when physicists and earth scientists pool their knowledge and experience. A background in local and regional geology is especially important</p><br />

Please answer it in essay type .....Thanks </h2><br />
                        I'm too lazy to make an essay so just lemme share my ideas.<br /><br />1. Was there ever a time when you become someone's hero?<br />Me? A hero?<br />Everyone can be a hero in their own simple ways.<br />I once gave a beggar something to eat. When I'm thinking about it now, I can't believe myself that I've done something.... something good. I'm kind of a  scrooge person. But you know what? Thinking about it makes me feel... joy. I don't know why but to be honest, I really feel .. joy.<br />It's just... unbelievable for me, hehe. I'm a selfish and mean little girl who grew to be worse than before. Yep, that's really me. It's not obvious but I'm that bad :P<br />But that's it because ... for real? I can't. I don't know why but I can't... I think. d-.- b<br /><br />2. For you, what is love? (Walamporever, jk)<br />Love? Love is something that makes us feel happy and... makes us feel pain and lonely. Well, I'm a kid and that's the only sensible thing I can say about this topic. d._. b<br /><br />3. What is the romantic song or music that you love?<br />No comment, lol. I'm not into romantic songs, that's why. <br /><br />4. I don't understand your question for number four, sorry.<br />5. Would you want to know the exact date of you death? Why?<br />Yes. I don't wanna change how things work in this world full of mysteries, joy, sadness, love, and pain BUT I still wanna know the exact date of my death. I've read a story, the time of their death is written somewhere in their body (I just stopped reading it because my nose will surely bleed, lol). I've read the first chapters and the speaker seems to be ready...<br />I asked myself, "Why could be this happen for real?"<br />It's because I think, it will be easier for us to leave. We may feel sadness but at least, we won't regret things. People became regretful because it's too late, right? Just like in the story I've read.. Candice (the female protagonist) became regretful because she became a bad daughter. She didn't listen to her father's side... it's too late.<br />It's too late to become regretful...<br />And that causes ..too ..much ...pain.<br />

The events that occurred during Holy Week are pivotal in Christian faith, and the week provides an opportunity for spiritual reflection, renewal, and growth.</p><p></p>Body:<p>Holy Week is marked by various ceremonies and services that follow the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. On Palm Sunday, Christians commemorate Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem by waving palm branches, just as the crowds did in his time. On Maundy Thursday, Christians remember the Last Supper, where Jesus washed the disciples' feet and instituted the sacrament of Holy Communion. On Good Friday, Christians remember the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ, while on Holy Saturday, they wait in anticipation of his resurrection. On Easter Sunday, Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the cornerstone of their faith.</p><p></p>Conclusion:<p>In conclusion, Holy Week is a time of great significance to Christians worldwide. Through the different ceremonies and services, Christians reflect on the events that led to Jesus' death and resurrection.

February 25 has become a symbol of the Filipino people's courage and struggle for democracy. Changing the date could also confuse and disorient people, as February 25 has been ingrained in their collective memory for over three decades.</p><p></p><p>Evidence: The significance of February 25 as the day of People Power Revolution is deeply rooted in Philippine history. On that day in 1986, millions of Filipinos took to the streets to oust a dictator and reclaim their democracy. The peaceful revolution that followed inspired other countries in the world to fight for their own freedom and democracy. Changing the date could also undermine the country's efforts to commemorate and remember the sacrifices of those who fought for democracy.</p><p></p><p>Counter Argument: Some may argue that moving the date could help spread awareness and knowledge about the People Power Revolution to younger generations who may not be aware of its significance. They may also argue that changing the date could create an opportunity for reflection and discussion about the country's democratic values and principles.</p><p></p><p>Rebuttal: While it is important to educate younger generations about the significance of People Power Revolution, changing the date is not the best way to achieve this. Instead, there should be efforts to educate and raise awareness about the revolution throughout the year. Moreover, reflection and discussion about the country's democratic values can still be done on February 25, even without changing the date.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion: In conclusion, the day of People Power Revolution on February 25 should not be moved to other dates. The significance of this day in Philippine history cannot be understated, and changing it may diminish its importance and confuse the people. Instead, there should be more efforts to educate and raise awareness about the revolution, and to continue commemorating and remembering the sacrifices of those who fought for democracy.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>KEEP ON LEARNING ^√^</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The issue I want to discuss is climate change and its impact on our planet. Climate change is an issue that affects every aspect of our lives - from the way we live to the future of our planet. Despite all the evidence supporting it, there are still some people who deny it.</p><p></p><p>According to the NASA Global Climate Change website, the Earth's global temperature has increased by approximately 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1.0 degree Celsius) since the 19th century, and the rate of warming has been increasing steadily. This might seem like a small increase, but it is having profound effects on our planet.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant impacts is the melting of polar ice caps, which is leading to rising sea levels. The National Ocean Service reports that sea levels have risen about 8 inches (21 cm) since 1880, and this number is increasing.

                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected education globally, including special education. In the Philippines, where special education is still a developing field, the pandemic has highlighted the need for further improvements in the sector. Despite some positive developments, the state of special education in the Philippines during the pandemic is still inadequate.</p><p></p><p>One positive development in the Philippines is the increased awareness and attention given to special education during the pandemic. The government has launched various initiatives, including the provision of assistive technology and online training for teachers to support students with special needs. Additionally, the Department of Education (DepEd) has released guidelines for distance learning for students with disabilities.</p><p></p><p>However, these initiatives fall short in addressing the needs of all students with special needs in the country. For instance, the provision of assistive technology has been limited and not enough to support all students with disabilities. Additionally, online training for teachers is not enough to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to support students with different learning needs.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the pandemic has exposed the already existing challenges in special education in the Philippines. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, the government has failed to ensure that all children with disabilities have access to education. Many students with disabilities face barriers to enrollment, such as lack of transportation, inaccessible classrooms, and insufficient support services. The pandemic has only made these challenges more evident, with many students with disabilities unable to access distance learning materials and services.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while some progress has been made in the field of special education in the Philippines during the pandemic, the state of special education is still inadequate. The government must do more to address the barriers to education faced by students with disabilities, including the provision of more assistive technology and support services, and the improvement of teacher training. Only then can students with special needs receive the education they deserve, even during these challenging times.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>According to the Department of Education (DepEd) in the Philippines, there are currently over 2 million learners with disabilities enrolled in public and private schools across the country. These learners are entitled to special education services to help them succeed in their academic pursuits. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of special education services has been severely impacted, leading to a decline in the quality of education received by learners with disabilities.</p><p></p><p>One of the challenges facing special education in the Philippines during the pandemic is the lack of access to technology and the internet. With the implementation of distance learning, learners with disabilities who do not have access to the necessary technology and internet connection are at a disadvantage. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of learners with disabilities who are able to participate in online classes.</p><p></p><p>Another issue is the lack of training and resources for teachers who are tasked with providing special education services. Many teachers are not equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to provide effective online special education services. This has resulted in the quality of education received by learners with disabilities being compromised.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the pandemic has exacerbated the existing inequalities in the education system. Learners with disabilities from low-income families are particularly vulnerable, as they may not have access to the same resources and support as their peers from more affluent backgrounds. This further widens the gap in the quality of education between different groups of learners.</p><p></p><p>In light of these challenges, it is imperative that the government takes action to address the issues facing special education in the Philippines during the pandemic. This includes providing learners with disabilities with the necessary technology and internet connection, as well as providing teachers with the training and resources they need to effectively deliver special education services online. Additionally, more support should be given to learners from low-income families to ensure that they are not left behind.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the pandemic has brought to light the challenges facing special education in the Philippines. It is crucial that the government takes action to address these challenges and ensure that learners with disabilities are not left behind. By providing the necessary support and resources, we can ensure that all learners have access to quality education, regardless of their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Study hard,hope it help</p><br />
