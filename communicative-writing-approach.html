My motive alone would have nothing to do with the rightness or wrongness of the act.3.Virtue ethics teaches: An action is only right if it is an action that a virtuous person would carry out in the same circumstances. A virtuous person is a person who acts virtuously. A person acts virtuously if they "possess and live the virtues"<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sana makatulong pa brainlies at Pa heart</p><p></p><br />
