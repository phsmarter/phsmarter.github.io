                                            Essay A (Argumentative Essay) Essay B (Inform GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memonizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole systern. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too​</a>

I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth?

                        <p>Answer:With the presidential election only one short month away, it’s important to know what makes a good leader. When choosing our president, not only should we look at their politics, but we should also look at their character. The certain qualities a person possesses can potentially determine what kind of leader they will be. I believe that a good leader possesses the qualities of dependability, integrity and perseverance. Without these qualities, I don’t see how any person can lead and direct a group, or in this case, a whole nation.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><p>title : being a good example to the member</p><p></p><p>The most important traits are confidence and responsibility. A good leader is doing everything confidently and encourages this confidence in others. He or she cheers up people and makes them feel that they are needed and that they are doing everything well.</p><p></p><p>Though, a confident but non-responsible person is likely to get the whole team in trouble. The team needs to rely on their leader. Everyone can fail. In case of failure, a responsible leader should look for the ways out of the situation instead of blaming the others and criticizing them.Honesty is the next important quality. Naturally, people want to trust their leader. A good leader is not afraid of admitting own mistakes. He analyzes the moment when something went wrong and does everything to avoid this mistake again in the future.</p><p></p><p>Actually, analytical skills are essential. Leadership is not only about personal qualities but also about management skills. A good leader is able to see the situation as a whole and to divide it into the subsections at the same time. This person is capable of making efficient every subsection of the project in order to make the whole project thrive.</p><p></p><p>Communication skills create a leader along with the analytical ones.</p><p></p><p>To sum up, a good leader is likely to be a confident, responsible and honest person with outstanding analytical and communication skills. Certainly, this is not the whole list of qualities and skills but the mentioned ones are obligatory and irreplaceable.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>ikaw nalang gumawa ng tittle kung want mo pero ayan .</p><br />

                            6. Essay A (Argumentative Essay) Essay B (Inform GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memonizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole systern. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The most important traits are confidence and responsibility. A good leader is doing everything confidently and encourages this confidence in others. He or she cheers up people and makes them feel that they are needed and that they are doing everything well.</p><p></p><p>Though, a confident but non-responsible person is likely to get the whole team in trouble. The team needs to rely on their leader. Everyone can fail. In case of failure, a responsible leader should look for the ways out of the situation instead of blaming the others and criticizing them.</p><p></p><p>Honesty is the next important quality. Naturally, people want to trust their leader. A good leader is not afraid of admitting own mistakes. He analyzes the moment when something went wrong and does everything to avoid this mistake again in the future.</p><p></p><p>Actually, analytical skills are essential. Leadership is not only about personal qualities but also about management skills. A good leader is able to see the situation as a whole and to divide it into the subsections at the same time. This person is capable of making efficient every subsection of the project in order to make the whole project thrive.</p><p></p><p>Communication skills create a leader along with the analytical ones.</p><p></p><p>To sum up, a good leader is likely to be a confident, responsible and honest person with outstanding analytical and communication skills. Certainly, this is not the whole list of qualities and skills but the mentioned ones are obligatory and irreplaceable</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>hope it helps po</p><p>copy paste lang po yan</p><p>What Makes a Good Leader </p><p></p><p>With the presidential election only one short month away, it’s important to know what makes a good leader. When choosing our president, not only should we look at their politics, but we should also look at their character. The certain qualities a person possesses can potentially determine what kind of leader they will be. I believe that a good leader possesses the qualities of dependability, integrity and perseverance. Without these qualities, I don’t see how any person can lead and direct a group, or in this case, a whole nation.</p><p>One of the single most important aspects of a good leader is dependability. To be a leader means you have a lot of responsibilities, so people have to depend on you to take care these responsibilities. Sometimes, being a leader comes with hard decisions, but it’s your responsibility to make those decisions. If people can depend on you to get them through not only the good times, but the hard ones too, then you have the making of a great leader.</p><p>Another important quality of being a great leader is integrity. The possession of firm principals ensures that you will make the most responsible decisions and do what you truly think is best. Having integrity means a person is honest, trustworthy, reliable, loyal and honorable. To be a leader you must possess these certain characteristics so that you are able to lead fairly and justly. Without integrity and a good set of core values, how can we be able to trust our leaders.</p><p>The last, but not least, essential quality of a good leader is perseverance. With determination and perseverance, we can know that our leader will keep focused and get us through difficult times. To be determined is one of the most important aspects of a leader so perseverance to do your best and lead the people in the right direction is crucial. Without motivation, a leader can fold under the pressures of the job and let down the people. Perseverance ensures that the job done and the people will be led properly.</p><p>So on November 6th, when you go place your vote for the new President of the United States of America, remember what makes a good leader. Dependability will ensure that our new leader can be trusted to carry out his job. Integrity certifies that our new leader has good values to lead us fairly, and perseverance confirms that out new leader will get us through the hard times. If the person you choose has all of these qualities, then we can be sure we’re making the right decision.</p><br />

                            18. I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth?
