Why They Turn to the Sea As job opportunities are decreasing on land, more young people are turning to the sea for a living. Some of them choose to work on ships. However, many young people would rather work on the sea than on land. In my opinion, there are several reasons that account for increasing interest in pursuing maritime professions. First, our country is made up of many lands. We are surrounded by water. It is not surprising that many people have grown to love the sea, they decide to work on it. Second, some school dropouts in the country as well as those young people who have just finished their education in school are tooking for jobs at the same time. Many fail to get work in offices or factories, so these young people turn to the sea as last resort. Third, some young people face problems at home. They want to get as far away from these problems as possible. The sea becomes a popular means of escape. Finally, young people are naturally advantageous. They love to explore new places. They enjoy excitement that comes with this. By working on ships, they can travel far and wide. Thus, many young people are attracted to the maritime profession.​</a>

Why They Turn to the Sea As job opportunities are decreasing on land, more young people are turning to the sea for a living. Some of them choose to work on ships. However, many young people would rather work on the sea than on land. In my opinion, there are several reasons that account for increasing interest in pursuing maritime professions. First , our country is made up of many lands. We are surrounded by water. It is not surprising that many people have grown to love the sea, they decide to work on it. Second, some school dropouts in the country as well as those young people who have just finished their education in school are looking for jobs at the same time. Many fail to get work in offices or factories, so these young people turn to the sea as last resort. Third, some young people face problems at home. They want to get as far away from these problems as possible. The sea becomes a popular means of escape. Finally, young people are naturally advantageous. They love to explore new places. They enjoy excitement that comes with this. By working on ships, they can travel far and wide. Thus, many young people are attracted to the maritime profession.

Regardless of the reason, love is still real and valid.</p><p></p><p>The second line reminds us that, despite life's ups and downs, the sun rises every morning. This represents hope and the idea that life goes on regardless of what happens and that there is always the possibility of a new day and a new beginning.</p><p></p><p>The third line discusses how love can be a destructive force. It implies that love can be painful and upsetting, and that it does not always have a happy ending.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>11.In the opening scenes of Romeo and Juliet, for example, the word heavy has the meaning of “sorrowful,” the word envious is used where we would say “malicious,” sadly where we would use “gravely” or “seriously,” his where we would use “its,” happy where we would say “fortunate,” </p><p>12.We learn that Juliet will turn fourteen in a little more than two weeks, meaning that she's thirteen during the events of the play. Legally, girls in Elizabethan England could marry as young as 12 with parental consent.</p><p>13.Even though some people don't believe in it, there's actually science behind the feeling of falling in love at first sight. True, deep love may not exist yet when you first meet someone, but you may create the memory of falling in love later on in your relationship.</p><p>14.A second chance can work if the right foundation is in place. It's normal to want to see signs of that foundation in the connection you share. But not all relationships are worth the sacrifices they ask of you.</p><p>15.I would wrote the ending that they found out each other alive and they hugged so tight with a happy ending ofcourse</p><p>16.Love marriage: The partners are fully responsible to make their life decisions and the stand to take during conflicts. Hence they are not in a position to blame others for any losses or gains. Arranged marriage: The families of the marrying couple come together into a new relationship.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>What I Have Learned:The first lesson from Romeo and Juliet that we had learn is to be sincere in life just like they are sincere to each other. Secondly there are values in life that we should not forget and we have to keep our promises too.</p><br />
