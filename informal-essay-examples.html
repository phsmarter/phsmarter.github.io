                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> Example of Informative Essay</p><p>Marriage is a culturally recognised union between people, called spouses, that establishes rights and obligations between them, as well as between them and their children, and between them and their in-laws. It is considered a cultural universal, but the definition of marriage varies between cultures and religions, and over time. Typically, it is an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually sexual, are acknowledged or sanctioned. In some cultures, marriage is recommended or considered to be compulsory before pursuing any sexual activity. A marriage ceremony is called a wedding.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Example of Argumentative Essay</p><p>Once you reach a certain age or a certain amount of time spent with the same partner, especially as a woman, friends and family will inevitably start asking questions about marriage or even downright pressure you into taking this step. But is getting married such a good idea? I believe not, since, nowadays, at least in the developed countries, it doesn’t bring truly valuable benefits.</p><p></p><p>Marriage is no longer necessary legally or practically. Once upon a time, for a woman, getting married meant ensuring financial security and gaining access to a variety of legal rights they wouldn’t dream of otherwise. But now, in the modern world, years after the feminist movement has established legal rights for women, we no longer need marriage to get access to certain benefits. Nowadays, women are highly educated and actually constitute the majority of the workforce in the US. Furthermore, we no longer require a marriage license to be allowed to visit our partner in the hospital, and, for a lot of us, getting married doesn’t even imply a tax break.</p><p></p><p>Marriage does not guarantee fidelity. Many people get married hoping that the sanctity of marriage will reduce the chances of being cheated on. But if your spouse doesn’t respect your relationship and is tempted to cheat, a piece of paper will have no power in preventing infidelity. Actually, it seems that in around half of marriages, one of the spouses will have an extra-marital relation at some point.</p><p></p><p>There’s no longer a stigma on you if you have a child without getting married. While, in the past, having a child before marriage was terrifying for a woman due to social stigmatization, nowadays, we’ve become considerably more open-minded. Actually, according to a Pew report, even in 2008, over 40 percent of births were to unmarried women – and the number has risen during the last few years. In addition, according to the HHS, a third of children adoptions in the US are by single parents or unmarried couples.</p><p></p><p>Marriage does not bring security in a relationship. There are too many people deciding to get married for the wrong reason. And one of them is thinking that it will ensure that “until death do us part”. While this may have been true a long time ago, or still is when it comes to very religious persons, marriage doesn’t ensure the security of the relationships in many of the cases. Though the divorce in the US rate has seen ups and downs during the last few years, it is still alarmingly higher compared to what it was a few decades ago. The only thing that will truly bring security is having a strong relationship, based on trust, no matter the legal status.</p><p></p><p>Love is mysterious and magical, and it should stay that way. And marriage, by definition, is just a contract. The beauty of love is that it is undefined, it is unique to you and your beloved one, and it is continually changing as you grow together. I neither need nor want my love to be defined in legal terms.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>An informative essay is a type of academic writing that aims to educate readers on a particular topic. It presents facts, statistics, and other forms of evidence to support a thesis statement. Here is an example of an informative essay:</p><p></p><p>Title: The Benefits of Regular Exercise</p><p></p><p>Maintaining good health is essential for a happy and fulfilling life. Regular exercise is an effective way to keep the body healthy and prevent various diseases. This essay will discuss the benefits of regular exercise for physical and mental health.</p><p></p><p>Physical Benefits of Regular Exercise</p><p></p><p>Regular exercise has numerous physical benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, increased muscle strength, and weight management. Engaging in aerobic exercise, such as running, cycling, or swimming, can improve heart health and reduce the risk of heart disease. Strength training exercises, such as weightlifting, can increase muscle mass and improve overall strength. Regular exercise can also help manage weight by burning calories and reducing body fat.</p><p></p><p>Mental Health Benefits of Regular Exercise</p><p></p><p>In addition to physical benefits, regular exercise has significant mental health benefits. Exercise can help reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, and boost self-esteem. It can also help alleviate symptoms of depression and other mental health disorders. Exercise releases endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that help improve mood and reduce stress.</p><p></p><p>How to Incorporate Regular Exercise into Your Daily Routine</p><p></p><p>Incorporating regular exercise into your daily routine can be a challenge, especially if you have a busy schedule. However, there are many ways to make exercise a part of your daily routine. You can start with small changes, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or walking to work instead of driving. You can also try different types of exercise to find what works best for you, such as yoga, Pilates, or dance classes.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion</p><p></p><p>Regular exercise has numerous physical and mental health benefits. Engaging in regular exercise can help improve heart health, increase muscle strength, manage weight, reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, and boost self-esteem. Incorporating exercise into your daily routine can be a challenge, but the benefits are worth the effort. By making small changes to your routine, you can improve your overall health and well-being.</p><p>An informative essay is a type of academic writing that aims to educate or inform readers about a particular topic. Below is an example of an informative essay on the topic of climate change:</p><p></p><p>Climate Change: Causes, Effects, and Solutions</p><p></p><p>Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing the world today. It refers to the long-term changes in the Earth's climate, including rising temperatures, changes in precipitation, and more frequent extreme weather events. Climate change is caused by a combination of natural and human factors, including greenhouse gas emissions from human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.</p><p></p><p>The effects of climate change are far-reaching and potentially catastrophic. Rising sea levels threaten to flood coastal cities and displace millions of people, while more frequent and intense heat waves and droughts can lead to food and water shortages. Climate change can also exacerbate natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires, causing billions of dollars in damages.</p><p></p><p>Despite the daunting challenges posed by climate change, there are a number of solutions that can help mitigate its effects. One of the most effective solutions is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to cleaner sources of energy, such as wind and solar power. This can be achieved through a combination of policy measures, such as carbon pricing and regulations on emissions, as well as technological innovations and investments in renewable energy infrastructure.</p><p></p><p>In addition to reducing emissions, adaptation measures can also help communities prepare for and cope with the effects of climate change. This includes building sea walls and other infrastructure to protect against rising sea levels, as well as improving water management and agricultural practices to adapt to changing precipitation patterns.</p><p></p><p>Overall, addressing climate change will require a concerted global effort and a combination of mitigation and adaptation measures. By taking action now, we can help prevent the worst effects of climate change and build a more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Renewable Energy: The Future of Power Generation</p><p></p><p>As the world’s population continues to grow, so does the demand for energy. However, the current methods of power generation such as burning fossil fuels have negative impacts on the environment. This has led to an increased interest in renewable energy sources as a way to meet our energy needs while minimizing environmental impact. In this essay, we will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of renewable energy and its potential to revolutionize power generation.</p><p></p><p>Renewable energy sources are those that are replenished naturally and can be harnessed without depleting their reserves. These include solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass energy. One of the main benefits of renewable energy is that it produces no greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. This makes it a cleaner and more sustainable option than fossil fuels, which emit high levels of carbon dioxide and other harmful gases.</p><p></p><p>Another advantage of renewable energy is that it is inexhaustible. Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite resources, renewable energy sources can be used indefinitely. This means that once the initial investment in infrastructure is made, the cost of producing energy from renewable sources is much lower than that of fossil fuels, which require ongoing mining, transportation, and refining.</p><p></p><p>Renewable energy also has a much smaller environmental footprint than fossil fuels. For example, wind and solar farms can be built on previously unused land, while hydropower dams can be built in areas that are already developed. In addition, renewable energy sources do not produce waste products that need to be disposed of, unlike fossil fuels which produce toxic byproducts such as ash and sulfur dioxide.</p><p></p><p>However, renewable energy also has its drawbacks. One of the main challenges is that it can be intermittent, meaning that energy production is not always consistent. For example, solar panels only produce energy when the sun is shining, and wind turbines only generate electricity when there is sufficient wind. This means that energy storage technology must be developed to ensure that renewable energy sources can provide power when needed.</p><p></p><p>Another challenge is the high upfront cost of installing renewable energy infrastructure. This can be a significant barrier to adoption, particularly in countries where there is little government support for renewable energy development. However, as the cost of renewable energy technology continues to decrease, it is becoming more competitive with fossil fuels.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, renewable energy is a promising option for meeting our energy needs while minimizing environmental impact. Although there are challenges to its adoption, the benefits of renewable energy, including its sustainability, low environmental footprint, and lower cost, make it a viable alternative to fossil fuels. With continued investment and innovation, renewable energy has the potential to revolutionize power generation and help create a more sustainable future for all.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps!</p><p> </p><p>sana po makatulong</p><p>pa brainliest po</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sample of informative essay</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>James Baldwin said it best. "I met a lot of people in Europe. I even encountered myself" (Baldwin, 2014). Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today.
</p><p>
</p><p>The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they stand still on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local.
</p><p>
</p><p>Also in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel, but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath.
</p><p>
</p><p>In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, "I never travel with friends. When I'm exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick" (Byrnes, 2018).
</p><p>
</p><p>This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, "We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We focus on work, family, to-do lists, chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all" (Byrnes, 2018).
</p><p>
</p><p>Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable on the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.</p><br />

Of course, they can also answer "how," indicating how to do something.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Essay on the Origins of Film</strong></p><p>By <strong>lon Martea</strong></p><p></p><p>There are multiple debates concerning the origins of film. Photographers in</p><p>the nineteenth century were anxious to find a way to capture movement,</p><p>almost from the moment they discovered the art of photography. It took less</p><p>than half a century, and by the 1870s, Edward Muybridge has already made</p><p>significant advances, managing with the use of the zoopraxiscope to exhibit</p><p>successfully a series of moving images. Muybridge was a scientist, so for him</p><p>the experiments did not serve an artistic purpose. That is why, despite their</p><p>historical importance in the development of technology, his pieces are rather</p><p>foreign to film as we understand it.</p><p>The birth of film as an artform can be pinpointed conveniently to 1895, with</p><p>the first public exhibition of a number of one-minute single shots directed by</p><p>the Lumière brothers. L'arrivée d'un train à La Ciotat [Arrival of a Train at La</p><p>Ciotat] (1896) has all the attributes to eam it the accolade of being the first</p><p>film, particularly as it was shown originally to a large audience. However, as</p><p>the popularity of television and home video has proven, film spectatorship</p><p>can also be solitary. The acceptance of film as a solitary experience, not only</p><p>a collective one, has allowed the earlier mavericks (who only managed to</p><p>offer screenings of their output to one spectator at a time) to claim the</p><p>invention of the medium.</p><p>The recently discovered Roundhay Garden Scene (1888) is probably the</p><p>earliest film, followed swiftly by works by two other Englishmen: William</p><p>Friese-Greene working in the UK (1889), and William K.L. Dickson, the</p><p>celebrated employee at Edison Manufacturing Company, in the USA</p><p>(1890). These are all raw pieces, running several seconds, yet they all share</p><p>two elements lacking in Muybridge's work, namely a continuous rather than</p><p>cyclical sequence, and most importantly the occurrence of certain emotional</p><p>experiences to images that are potentially ideological in essence.</p><p>Pinpointing the true birth of film, as opposed to the conception of it, is</p><p>therefore a more difficult task than one would expect. What is the first</p><p>production that is both technically and ideologically essential for this early</p><p>period?</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>An informal essay is typically used in a business setting to provide summaries of transactions, procedures and events. On the other hand, formal essays are nearly always used in academic research. The primary differences between these two forms of essay writing are the tone of the writing and the structure of the essay.</p><p></p><p>Informal essays have no set structure and they are typically shorter than formal essays. Informal essays also use first and second person, and often include thoughts and opinions. The subject matter of informal essays is brief and a subject does not explore the topic in depth. Rather, informal essays are usually informational in nature and only include the most relevant and basic information needed to inform the reader.</p><p></p><p>Unlike an informal essay, formal essays have a specific structure and are often very lengthy. Although the structure varies depending on the type of essay, formal essays have a defined introduction, body and conclusion. Formal essays also require the use of a professional tone and third person narrative. Since formal essays are often written to summarize research, in-text citations and references must be listed to add credibility to the document. Additionally, formal essays usually have a narrowed focus and explore a subject in-depth.</p><br />

Photography lets us see something we may never have noticed otherwise. Photography is a way to express your ideas for others to see. There is no way to deny that life flies by.The idea of colours floating across a sheet of paper forming either familiar shapes or new creations is appealing to the eye. In reality, though it is much more than just the beads of colour. Photography can capture someone’s heart and soul. Even the simplest photo has a story that tails along with it. It is an escape from the real world; a creation that narrows on one particular subject and carefully details their every move and emotion.</p><p></p><p>Photography was invented, about a century ago. In those early days, only simple box-cameras were available to take simple black and white pictures. Photographic techniques and equipments have come a long way since then. </p><p></p><p>Exploding flash guns have progressed to compact electronic flash unit, box-cameras to sophisticated computerised reflex cameras, stills to movies, black-and-white to full glorious colours and part-time dabblers to highly paid professionals.Photography as a hobby is perhaps the most popular of all its uses. Cameras and films are now cheap and easy to use. ‘Instamatic’ cameras have largely eliminated the hit-or-miss techniques of the past . Tourist and sightseers are never without cameras. Pictures and snapshots of important events, wonderful times and places or memories to be precise, are all recorded in photographs. They are our link to the past.</p><p></p><p>A well-clicked photograph is worth more than a thousand words. It describes a scene infinitely better than mere words can depict. Besides making newspapers and magazines attractive, photography provides jobs to numerous professionals who roam around the world in search of pictures.</p><p></p><p>‘Eyes work more than ears’ is a widespread fact. Use of photographs helps people to retain better. Photographs/images get quickly captured in our mind and stays in our memory for a relatively longer time. That’s why it is also said that many people have photographic memory wherein whatever they see gets stored in their mind and helps in remembering things quicker and in a better way. </p><p></p><p>This proven fact has been rightly harnessed by the educationist wherein they use more and more of pictures in text books and while teachingThat’s why it is also said that many people have photographic memory wherein whatever they see gets stored in their mind and helps in remembering things quicker and in a better way.
