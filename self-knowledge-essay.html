Although the subtitle has been dropped from most modern editions, the allusive qualities of Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus, is a horror novel by Mary Shelley, still remain. The reference here to the Titan Prometheus relies on centuries of interpretation through Greek myth and drama. Often seen as symbolizing the danger present when human knowledge oversteps its boundaries, Prometheus and what he represents are reflected in the product of Victor Frankenstein's ghastly experiments.2. Gregory Maguire's novel Wicked. The novel was inspired by L. Frank Baum's 1939 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Inspired by the omitted story of how the Wicked Witch came to be wicked, Maguire created a story which defined the Wicked Witch's beginning 3. The Maenads Dionysus presided over fertility both for the vineyards and for women's wombs. His followers, predominantly female, were known as Maenads -meaning "raving ones". These women shared their god's love of wine and raucous behaviour, and he encouraged them to indulge in both. Marauding bands of Maenads terrorized the Theban countryside so much that Pentheus, the King of Thebes, banned the cult of Dionysus. The king's decree was angrily rejected by many women - including the king's own mother - who went out into the countryside to praise the wine-god in one last, climactic rite. Dionysus convinced Pentheus to climb a tree to enjoy the view of the final orgy. Dressed in women's clothes, the king went to watch, but was seen by the ecstatic Maenads. Mistaking him for a wild animal, they tore him limb from limb. See also: The Olympian gods. The many affairs of Zeus. Vesta and Priapus A complex god 4. "Patchwork Girl" is a work of electronic literature by American Author, Shelley Jackson. I was written in Storyspace and published by Eastgate Systems in 1995, and tells the story through illustrations of parts of a female body that are stitched together through text and image. A short essay on "Patchwork Girl" entitled "Stitching Together Narrative, Sexuality. Self" by Brown University English Professor, George P. Landow, can be found here 5. JK Rowling's Harry Potter series shares much with Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll, including interactions with giant chess pieces. JK Rowling also used platform 9% as an entrance into a magical world, just as Lewis Carroll used the looking glass.​</a>

                        <p>Attention Grabber: Have you ever wondered what it would be like if all the ancient literatures were shredded? The Library of Congress has decided to shred some of the most famous epic literatures that have been published long ago. As an activist on the board of PAC (Protect Ancient Civilizations), I strongly believe that these literatures should be saved.</p><p></p><p>Focus: The Library of Congress is a place where ancient literatures are kept safe for future generations to read and learn from. However, the decision to shred some of the most famous epic literatures is a grave mistake. These literatures are not just words on a page, but they are a representation of the culture and history of our ancestors. Destroying them would be like erasing a part of our past.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Evidence and Examples: One of the most famous epic literatures that is at risk of being shredded is the Epic of Gilgamesh. This literature is considered one of the earliest surviving works of literature and is a representation of the Mesopo.tamiam culture. It tells the story of a king who goes on a journey to find eternal life and is a reflection of the human desire for immortality. Another literature that is at risk is the Iliad, which is an ancient Greek epic poem that tells the story of the Trojan War. This literature is a representation of the Greek culture and is a reflection of their values and beliefs.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Grammar: It is important to preserve these literatures for future generations to read and learn from. Destroying them would be a great loss to our society. We should not let these literatures be shredded and forgotten. Instead, we should cherish them and pass them down to future generations.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Audience: The Library of Congress is a place where ancient literatures are kept safe for future generations to read and learn from. As an activist on the board of PAC (Protect Ancient Civilizations), I urge the members of the Library of Congress to reconsider their decision to shred these literatures. These literatures are not just words on a page, but they are a representation of our culture and history. We should not let them be destroyed.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            8. Exercise 3 Identify which context was the text developed based on the literary descriptions below. Write INT for intertext and HYP for hypertext on your answer sheet. 1. Although the subtitle has been dropped from most modern editions, the allusive qualities of Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus, is a horror novel by Mary Shelley, still remain. The reference here to the Titan Prometheus relies on centuries of interpretation through Greek myth and drama. Often seen as symbolizing the danger present when human knowledge oversteps its boundaries, Prometheus and what he represents are reflected in the product of Victor Frankenstein's ghastly experiments.2. Gregory Maguire's novel Wicked. The novel was inspired by L. Frank Baum's 1939 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Inspired by the omitted story of how the Wicked Witch came to be wicked, Maguire created a story which defined the Wicked Witch's beginning 3. The Maenads Dionysus presided over fertility both for the vineyards and for women's wombs. His followers, predominantly female, were known as Maenads -meaning "raving ones". These women shared their god's love of wine and raucous behaviour, and he encouraged them to indulge in both. Marauding bands of Maenads terrorized the Theban countryside so much that Pentheus, the King of Thebes, banned the cult of Dionysus. The king's decree was angrily rejected by many women - including the king's own mother - who went out into the countryside to praise the wine-god in one last, climactic rite. Dionysus convinced Pentheus to climb a tree to enjoy the view of the final orgy. Dressed in women's clothes, the king went to watch, but was seen by the ecstatic Maenads. Mistaking him for a wild animal, they tore him limb from limb. See also: The Olympian gods. The many affairs of Zeus. Vesta and Priapus A complex god 4. "Patchwork Girl" is a work of electronic literature by American Author, Shelley Jackson. I was written in Storyspace and published by Eastgate Systems in 1995, and tells the story through illustrations of parts of a female body that are stitched together through text and image. A short essay on "Patchwork Girl" entitled "Stitching Together Narrative, Sexuality. Self" by Brown University English Professor, George P. Landow, can be found here 5. JK Rowling's Harry Potter series shares much with Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll, including interactions with giant chess pieces. JK Rowling also used platform 9% as an entrance into a magical world, just as Lewis Carroll used the looking glass.​</h2><br />
