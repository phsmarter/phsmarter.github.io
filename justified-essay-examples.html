                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Evolution of Life
</p><p>The diversity of life on Earth today is the result of evolution. Life began on Earth at least 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, and it has been evolving ever since. At first, all living things on Earth were simple, single-celled organisms. Much later, the first multicellular organisms evolved, and after that, Earth’s biodiversity greatly increased. Figure below shows a timeline of the history of life on Earth. You can also find an interactive timeline of the history of life at the link
</p><p>
</p><p>Darwin and the Theory of Evolution
</p><p>The idea of evolution has been around for centuries. In fact, it goes all the way back to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. However, evolution is most often associated with Charles Darwin. Darwin published a book on evolution in 1859 titled On the Origin of Species. In the book, Darwin stated the theory of evolution by natural selection. He also presented a great deal of evidence that evolution occurs.
</p><p>
</p><p>Evolution is a change in the characteristics of living things over time. As described by Darwin, evolution occurs by a process called natural selection. In natural selection, some members of a species, being better adapted or suited to their environment, produce more offspring than others, so they pass "advantageous traits" to their offspring. Over many generations, this can lead to major changes in the characteristics of the species. Evolution explains how living things are changing today and how modern living things have descended from ancient life forms that no longer exist on Earth. As living things evolve, they generally become better suited for their environment. This is because they evolve adaptations. An adaptation is a trait that helps an organism survive and reproduce in a given environment.
</p><p>
</p><p>Despite all the evidence Darwin presented, his theory was not well-received at first. Many people found it hard to accept the idea that humans had evolved from an ape-like ancestor, and they saw evolution as a challenge to their religious beliefs. Look at the cartoon in Figure below. Drawn in 1871, it depicts Darwin himself as an ape. The cartoon reflects how many people felt about Darwin and his theory during his own time. Darwin had actually expected this type of reaction to his theory and had waited a long time before publishing his book for this reason. It was only when another scientist, named Alfred Russel Wallace, developed essentially the same theory of evolution that Darwin put his book into print.
</p><p>
</p><p>Charles Darwin’s name is linked with the theory of evolution. This cartoon from the 1870s makes fun of both Darwin and his theory.
</p><p>
</p><p>Although Darwin presented a great deal of evidence for evolution in his book, he was unable to explain how evolution occurs. That’s because he knew nothing about genes. As a result, he didn’t know how characteristics are passed from parents to offspring, let alone how they could change over time.
</p><p>
</p><p>Evolutionary Theory After Darwin
</p><p>Since Darwin’s time, scientists have gathered even more evidence to support the theory of evolution. Some of the evidence comes from fossils, and some comes from studies that show how similar living things are to one another. By the 1930s, scientists had also learned about genes. As a result, they could finally explain how characteristics of organisms could pass from one generation to the next and change over time.
</p><p>
</p><p>Using modern technology, scientists can now directly compare the genes of living species. The more genes different species share in common, the more closely related the species are presumed to be. Consider humans and chimpanzees. They share about 98% of their genes. This means that they shared a common ancestor in the not-too-distant past. This is just one of many pieces of evidence that show we are part of the evolution of life on Earth.
</p><p>
</p><p>Misconceptions About Evolution
</p><p>Today, evolution is still questioned by some people. Often, people who disagree with the theory of evolution do not really understand it. For example, some people think that the theory of evolution explains how life on Earth first began. In fact, the theory explains only how life changed after it first appeared. Some people think the theory of evolution means that humans evolved from modern apes. In fact, the theory suggests humans and modern apes have a common ancestor that lived several million years ago. These and other misconceptions about evolution contribute to the controversy that still surrounds this fundamental principle of biology.
</p><p>
</p><p>Summary
</p><p>Life began on Earth at least 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, and it has been evolving ever since.
</p><p>Darwin stated the theory of evolution by natural selection, presenting a great deal of evidence to support his theory.
</p><p>Evolution is a change in the characteristics of living things over time. Evolution occurs by natural selection.

                        <p>One example of bias is when a qualified candidate is not hired for a job because of their political beliefs. This is an unfair practice because an applicant's political affiliation should not be a factor when determining their suitability for a job. It is a clear example of political bias.</p><p></p><p>Another example of bias is when an employee is given a higher pay based on their religion. This scenario is an example of religious bias, which can be damaging to company culture and affects the morale of the employees.</p><p></p><p>Prejudice can also manifest in the form of social status-based discrimination. For instance, if students from wealthy families receive better treatment than scholars in a university, it's discrimination based on their socio-economic status. This treatment is unjust and is a form of prejudice against those who do not have the same financial resources.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, students being seated based on their skin color is an example of racial prejudice. This situation is discriminatory as the student's skin color should not be a factor in their seating arrangement.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, discrimination, bias, and prejudice are unprofessional and illegal behaviors that should not be tolerated in any workplace or educational environment. Discrimination in any form should be denounced to ensure that there is equal treatment for everyone, regardless of religion, race, political beliefs, or socioeconomic status.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We sometimes hear our friends say when they’re angry with someone, “Ka-karmahin din yan” or “Karmahin ka sana.” But when they tell it that way, they think of it as some sort of curse or bad luck happening on the person concerned. If we put it that way, they are actually saying, “Malasin ka sana.” As if the God they believe in will punish that person for doing them wrong. But that is not the case. For those who don’t believe in God, you know why.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the wrongdoers don’t always get what they deserve. We might see a few who are punished publicly but that’s it. But why be invested in what is happening to your enemies? For now, let us focus on our Personal karma.</p><p></p><p>For those unfamiliar with karma, the first thing you have to know is that we are born with karma. The environment you were born into is part of your karma. That is the start of your karma. And for people who believe in reincarnation, your current life is just a continuation of your karma from a previous life or lives. Putting an end to personal karma is a part of the work of Buddhists.</p><p></p><p>You must realize that you are not alone and there are other people in this world with you. Everybody is creating his/her own karma that affects the rest of us. For example, Person A murders Person B. It is Person A’s karma that led to him being murdered. Then it is the Person B’s karma that leads him to be sent to jail.</p><p></p><p>Karma means that our actions bring about consequences that affect us in the long run. “You reap what you sow” as they say. Think about it, every move we make will start a chain of events that will keep on going through everybody until it reaches us again. I guess it is similar to Chaos Theory. That’s just my opinion.</p><p></p><p>Karma is not done by some supernatural force that chooses to give it to you when it wants to although when karma gets you, you won’t be able to escape it. It was just meant to happen that way to you. So what must we do? The only way is to change your bad karma into good karma. If you don’t then you will continue to make bad karma for yourself. Karma will not feel like a single event and it is not totally your fault. It is the result of a combination of many different factors, you and your environment. Karma is neither good nor bad, it is an experience that just does what it is supposed to do in your life. And it is up to you to try to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>Karma can also be applied to any group. The actions of each member contribute to the karma of the group. You might notice that your Family has its own karma. Higher than that is the karma of your Community. Next to it is the Country karma. Our beloved Philippines is now feeling the effects of the karma produced by the past generations. The last is the karma of the whole planet. So create good karma for others and not just yourself.</p><p></p><p>If we don’t do something about our own karma, others will continue to suffer as a result of our ignorance. We can find a way out of our ignorance by being better informed of what is going on around us. Learn to anticipate different situations that may come. Make friends with the right kind of people who really know. And lastly, get to know yourself as an individual human being apart from the people around you so you can put your whole trust in yourself. Do something about your life.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Desserts and sweets are often considered unhealthy foods that should be avoided in a balanced diet. However, when eaten in moderation and as part of a healthy diet, desserts and sweets can offer some benefits. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of including desserts and sweets in one's diet and give three examples to support my argument.</p><p></p><p>First, desserts and sweets can provide a source of energy. Sugary foods like cakes, candy, and chocolate contain simple carbohydrates that can be easily broken down into glucose, the body's main source of energy. Consuming desserts and sweets in moderation can provide a quick energy boost, especially for people who engage in physical activity or who need to stay alert and focused for long hours at work.</p><p></p><p>Second, desserts and sweets can be a source of happiness and joy. Desserts are often associated with positive emotions and can trigger the release of "pleasant" chemicals like endorphins in the brain. Enjoying a piece of cake or a scoop of ice cream after a meal can provide a sense of satisfaction and refreshment, leading to a more positive attitude and better mental health.</p><p></p><p>Third, desserts and sweets can help maintain a healthy diet. Contrary to popular belief, desserts can be included in a healthy diet, as long as they are eaten in moderation and in balance with other foods. Desserts can provide essential nutrients like fiber, vitamins and minerals, especially if made with fruits, nuts or other healthy ingredients. In addition, incorporating sweets into one's diet can prevent feelings of deprivation and reduce the likelihood of later enjoying unhealthy foods.</p><p></p><p>In summary, although desserts and sweets should not be the cornerstone of his diet, they can have certain benefits when consumed in moderation and as part of a regular diet. healthy diet. These benefits include providing a source of energy, promoting happiness and joy, and contributing to a healthy and balanced diet. Ultimately, the key to reaping the benefits of desserts and sweets is to eat them in moderation and choose ones made with healthy ingredients. </p><br />

Sometimes we’re curious about the ingredients of the goods present in our kitchen that’s why we check it. Do you think the goods found in our kitchen exemplify the London dispersion forces? Yes or no, justify your answer and cite some examples. 3. Summer season is for outside activities. We go to different places to enjoy and relax but sometimes minor accident happens. We get wounded due to physical activities. The first thing that we do is to clean the cut and cover it with a bandage.

                        <p>Subject: Salvation History</p><p>Topic: The principle of faith/results of Faith</p><p></p><p>1. What is a principle?</p><p>A principle is a fundamental truth or law that serves as the foundation for a belief or a system of thought.</p><p></p><p>2. Give three examples of principles as quoted in the module.</p><p>- "The righteous shall live by faith."</p><p>- "Without faith, it is impossible to please God."</p><p>- "The just shall live by faith."</p><p></p><p>3. Faith in God is trust, confidence in Him, and in His promises.</p><p></p><p>4. It is dependent on the response of the individual involved, be he a believer, a seeker, or the person himself.</p><p></p><p>5. The nine results of faith include:</p><p>- Salvation</p><p>- Justification</p><p>- Sanctification</p><p>- Righteousness</p><p>- Forgiveness</p><p>- Peace</p><p>- Access to God</p><p>- Hope</p><p>- Transformation</p><p></p><p>6. By faith, we trust in God's promises, believe in His existence, and rely on His guidance.</p><p></p><p>7. By unbelief, we will doubt God's promises, question His existence, and rely on our own understanding.</p><p></p><p>8. Word Watch:</p><p>A) Unbelief: The lack of faith or refusal to believe.</p><p>B) Justified: Being declared righteous or acquitted of guilt.</p><p>C) Destiny: The predetermined course of events in a person's life.</p><p>D) Sanctified: Set apart or made holy for a sacred purpose.</p><p>E) Eternity: Infinite or unending time.</p><p></p><p>9. Essay:</p><p>Faith plays a crucial role in salvation as it is through faith that we receive the gift of salvation. By believing in Jesus Christ and His sacrifice on the cross, we are justified before God and receive forgiveness for our sins. Faith enables us to trust in God's promises and surrender our lives to Him.</p><p></p><p>Not all people are saved because salvation requires a personal response of faith. Each individual has the freedom to accept or reject the offer of salvation. While God desires all to be saved, some choose to reject Him or place their faith in other things. Salvation is a result of both God's grace and an individual's faith working together.</p><p></p><p>It is important to note that salvation is not based on our own merit or good works but solely on faith in Jesus Christ. It is by God's grace that we are saved, and faith is the means by which we receive that salvation.</p><br />
