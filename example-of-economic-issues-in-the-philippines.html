                                            Opinion 1:Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known superpower not through force of arms , but engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal’s decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair solution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right, Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratly islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries it, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its case against China at the United Nations, the Chinese government has dismissed the proceedings and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China’s utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of C more China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines?  The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from using destructive and deadly force on any ship that dares to trespass in their socalled territories? Nothing short of a war will convince China that its territorial ambitions have already exceeded the tolerance of the world. ​What are the merits of the opinions given?</a>

                                            Opinion 1: Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of the Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known super power not through force of arms, but by engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal's decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how the rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair resolution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in the Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right; Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratlys islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international law. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its cases against China at the United Nations, the Chines government has dismissed the proceeding and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China's utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines? The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from 26​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>how the explain of the bread</p>Horticulture has the potential to improve the economic status of the Philippines by boosting agricultural production, generating employment, increasing export revenue, and enhancing tourism. By investing in horticulture, the country can create a sustainable and thriving agricultural sector that benefits both rural communities and the wider economy. Despite the potential benefits of horticulture in the Philippines, the industry faces several challenges that can hinder its growth and development. The lack of access to capital is one of the issues in the horticulture industry in the Philippines. To address this, the government has implemented various programs, including the Agricultural Credit Policy Council (ACPC) and the Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (ACEF). These programs provide credit assistance to farmers and agribusinesses at low-interest rates, enabling them to invest in horticultural production. Another issue is the limited access to technology and inputs. To address this issue, the government has implemented various programs, such as the Philippine Rural Development Project (PRDP) and the Agri-Pinoy Rice Program. These programs provide training, access to modern farming technologies, and inputs to farmers, improving their productivity and profitability.<br />

                            12. Opinion 1:Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known superpower not through force of arms , but engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal’s decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair solution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right, Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratly islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries it, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its case against China at the United Nations, the Chinese government has dismissed the proceedings and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China’s utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of C more China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines?  The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from using destructive and deadly force on any ship that dares to trespass in their socalled territories? Nothing short of a war will convince China that its territorial ambitions have already exceeded the tolerance of the world. ​What are the merits of the opinions given?</h2><br />

                            19. Opinion 1: Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of the Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known super power not through force of arms, but by engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal's decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how the rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair resolution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in the Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right; Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratlys islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international law. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its cases against China at the United Nations, the Chines government has dismissed the proceeding and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China's utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines? The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from 26​</h2><br />
