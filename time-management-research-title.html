Kind : _____________________________________________3. Strength : _____________________________________________4. Weakness : _____________________________________________5. Importance : _____________________________________________Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this study explored the livedexperiences and struggles of 22 on-campus working students of ISAT U-MiagaoCampus. This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire andinterview in gathering information about their experiences and related variables.Frequency count, percentage, mean, and chi-square were used as statisticaltools. Results revealed that financial problem was the main factor that motivatedthe students to work on-campus. They experienced varied feelings as happiness,sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite work pressure, working students hadgood time management both for studies and work, with high self-esteem andgood academic performance. The study concluded that participants’ dual rolesin the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helpingthese students, especially on their financial needs for them to finish theirstudies.​</a>

                            7. RESEARCH TITLE:Assessment of PBNHS senior high school students level of awareness to the negative effect of online gamesRESEARCH PROBLEM:This study aims to determine the effects of mobile games in academic performance of students. The study was conducted among the grade 11 Gas students in the senior high department of PBNHS during the school year 2022-2023.The results of the study were used as a basis to enhance students teamwork and improve students activeness in school 1.What is the level of awareness of PBNHS senior high school students on the negative effects of online games? 2. How does playing mobile games affect the academic performance of grade 11 GAS students in PBNHS? 3. What are the common reasons why students engage in playing mobile games? 4.

Thank you.. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I apologize, but I cannot answer the research questions without conducting the study. However, I can provide some insights on how to approach the research questions.</p><p></p><p>1. To determine the level of awareness of PBNHS senior high school students regarding the negative effects of online games, you can conduct a survey or questionnaire that asks students about their knowledge of the potential negative effects of online games. You can also ask them about their personal experiences with online games and whether they have observed any negative effects on themselves or others.</p><p></p><p>2. To investigate how playing mobile games affects the academic performance of Grade 11 GAS students in PBNHS, you can collect data on the students' academic performance (e.g., grades, test scores) and compare it to their self-reported frequency and duration of mobile game use. You can also ask the students' teachers for their observations on the students' academic performance and behavior in class.</p><p></p><p>3. To identify the common reasons why students engage in playing mobile games, you can conduct interviews or focus groups with students and ask them about their motivations for playing mobile games. You can also ask them about the types of games they play and how often they play them.</p><p></p><p>4. To propose possible ways to enhance students' teamwork and improve their activeness in school, you can review the literature on effective strategies for promoting teamwork and active participation in the classroom. You can also gather input from teachers and students on what they believe would be effective strategies for promoting these behaviors.</p><p></p><p>5. To provide recommendations to students and parents on managing their time spent on mobile games to minimize the negative effects on academic performance, you can review the literature on effective strategies for managing screen time and provide recommendations based on this research.</p><br />
