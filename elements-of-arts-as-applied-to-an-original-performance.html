                        Performance art is a performance presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally interdisciplinary.
 Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully 
orchestrated; spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without
 audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the 
performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that 
involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or 
presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience.
 Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting 
and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a
 particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.

                            18. What are the elements of art as applied to do original performance?</h2><br />
                        Performance art is a performance presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally interdisciplinary. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated; spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance may be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: <strong></strong>time, space, the performer's body or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer  and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.<br />
