My remarkable community quarantine experience It was a couple of months ago when the strictest quarantine was lifted nationwide and the patience of almost every one of us was put into test. Since I had nothing to do, I decided to become productive. I worked a lot of things, specifically my paper works from my full-time job and fixed some of my personal stuff which I was able to enjoy and finish. After those tasks, I spent the rest of my time getting along with my family, we watched numerous movies together which we truly enjoyed. Well, that may be very simple as how it seemned, but for me, it was the most remarkable experience that I had during quarantine because I got an opportunity to become even bonded with my family. Write your own paragraph about your community quarantine experience and tell how the experience became remarkable for you.

Before, an audio can be created and transmitted through tape, radio, or CD. Today, a different alternative is offered by the Internet - the podcast. You may have encountered the term in your previous lesson in Listening Strategies. It is a digital audio file that is posted on the Internet. For you to practice the guidelines in conducting an interview, interview an expert on any field (Example: teacher, nurse, engineer, etc.). Imagine you will produce a 5-minute informative podcast about your interviewee's expertise 1. First, copy and accomplish the template on "Interview Plan" in your paper. Then, provide the interviewee with a copy of the interview questions to allow him/her to prepare answers. Remember to use open-ended questions. (Example: What advice would you give someone who like to follow a similar career to yours?) Interview Plan Interviewer Purpose of interview: Interviewee:Information I know about the Interviewee: Job Position/Title: Workplace: Years in service/practice: Others: Possible Questions: 1. 2.3.4.5.Answers:1.2.3.4.5.2. If a smartphone or any sound recorder is available, you can use it to record the interview. You can use your recording to complete the last part of your Interview Plan where you will write your interviewee's answers. Remember to use a direct speech or write the exact answers of your interviewee. 3. After the interview, reflect on the questions that follow. Write your answers on your paper. ►► What was it like to interview someone? ►►Which of the tips or guidelines did you use, and how did it help you as an interviewer? ►► GOOD AND HELPFUL ANSWER = BRAINLIEST ►►NONSENSE ANSWER = REPORT!! ​</a>

part of your own story idea.
Product/ Performance
You need to create a short storyboard that has your own story ideas about the electromagnetic
spectrum concept. It should consist of illustrations or images displayed in sequence or timeline. A
finished storyboard looks like a comic strip, it is similar to a script, but the two aren't quite the same

Standards and Criteria for Success
You have two choices in creating a storyboard, either a hand – drawn or a storyboarding
software.
In making a manual storyboard:
Step 1: Create a template. Draw a series of rectangles on the paper provided, as you were
creating a comic strip.
Step 2: Add the script. Under each drawn rectangle, write the line of script or dialogue that
corresponds to that scene.
Step 3: Sketch out the story, make it as creative as possible. Step 4: Add some
notes.</a>

My remarkable community quarantine experience It was a couple of months ago when the strictest quarantine was lifted nationwide and the patience of almost every one of us was put into test. Since I had nothing to do, I decided to become productive. I worked a lot of things, specifically my paper works from my full-time job and fixed some of my personal stuff which I was able to enjoy and finish. After those tasks, I spent the rest of my time getting along with my family, we watched numerous movies together which we truly enjoyed. Well, that may be very simple as how it seemned, but for me, it was the most remarkable experience that I had during quarantine because I got an opportunity to become even bonded with my family. Write your own paragraph about your community quarantine experience and tell how the experience became remarkable for you. Criteria in marking the paragraph: Unity - 3 Organization -3 Spelling and Punctuation - 5 Use of Simple Past Tense - 4 Total - 20 (Title) 7​</h2><br />

If you are one of the members of this affected community (choose a role), what should you do to ensure that the disaster will not happen again in the future?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po please</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Recently, landslides and sinkholes have been a recurring disaster in the Philippines. One of the most recent incidents was in January 2021, when a landslide occurred in the municipality of Carmen in Cebu, resulting in three fatalities and one missing person.</p><p></p><p>The affected community was primarily composed of farmers and residents living in the nearby mountainous areas. These individuals were considered vulnerable due to their proximity to the landslide-prone areas, lack of education on disaster preparedness, and limited access to resources and infrastructure.</p><p></p><p>Signs of the impending hazard were seen in the cracks and fissures in the soil and rock formations in the affected areas. Heavy rainfall and weather disturbances also contribute to the destabilization of the soil, leading to landslides and sinkholes.</p><p></p><p>The disaster affected the community in various ways, including loss of life and property, displacement, and economic losses. Contributing factors to the severity of the disaster were the lack of proper land use planning, deforestation, and improper waste management.</p><p></p><p>If I were a member of the affected community, I would take an active role in disaster preparedness and mitigation. I would educate myself and others on the signs of impending hazards and promote sustainable land use practices such as reforestation, proper waste management, and erosion control measures. I would also advocate for the implementation of effective disaster risk reduction and management plans, including early warning systems and emergency response protocols.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the recurrence of landslides and sinkholes in the Philippines highlights the importance of disaster preparedness, sustainable land use practices, and effective governance in mitigating the impacts of natural hazards on vulnerable communities. It is essential to prioritize the safety and well-being of the affected communities to prevent similar disasters from happening in the future.</p><br />

My representative in Congress can be of help by proposing and supporting legislation that addresses these issues. For example, they can support laws that promote renewable energy and conservation, increase funding for education, and improve access to healthcare for all citizens. It is important for me to communicate my concerns to my representative so that they can take action on these important issues.</p><br />
