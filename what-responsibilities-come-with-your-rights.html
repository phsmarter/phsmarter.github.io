                                            Keep in Mind Suggested Time Allotment 10 minutes You have made decisions in the past and will be making still in the coming days, weeks or months. To be better on this, you may want to look back and reflect how you were doing it and be mindful on the learnings that those experiences try to mold in you. Did you have a moment of evaluating your decisions in the past? If so, how did you do it? Here are some pointers for you to make sense out of your past decisions: 1. Did you get the rightful results? Did it really solve your problem? If you answered "yes" to these questions, that's good. If "no", why did you say so? Did your solution create more problems or complications? If that's the case, then, you may take it as a learning experience. Maybe in your next decisions, you can check if your option will really answer the problem or it will create more. If it does, then, it certainly is not the right solution. You could consider other options next time and eliminate the choice that brought you more problems. 2. What were the consequences when you made that decision? What took place after your decision? Did it improve the situation? Did you feel good about it? Decision-making comes with responsibility. It is very ideal for any decision to be favorable for everyone. However, there are times that you need to calculate the risk of your choice. Hence, it has to be a well-calculated one. You are responsible for any decisions that you make. Good or bad, you have to own it. Be wiser with it. 3. Did it contribute to your personal growth in any areas of life (social relationship, academic performance, career pathing, health, spiritual, etc.) With your past decisions, can you identify any significant changes in your life in any aspect of it? For instance, when you decided to continue your studies during this pandemic, did it make a step nearer to your dream of finishing basic education? When you decided to stay at home instead of going out with your friends, did it make any difference to your safety? Try to appreciate whatever gains or personal development you have for any choice that you have. It is a good point of reference for your succeeding decision-making in life. 4. Did it consider the common good? In your past decisions, did it promote the welfare of everyone around you or there are regrets attached to it? There might be times when you are clouded by your personal biases or perceptions. However, the common good would always be a good consideration when weighing your options. At times, there is a need to analyze what is good for you and for everyone. Always try to check what would be good and gain for everyone. Your maturity and experiences aid you to always prioritize the common good. 5. How would that make you as a person?​</a>

Your parents do not know that you are always with them, they think you go to school every day. When the day comes you know there are a lot of right-wingers in the class and you fail the second mark, your parents find out and they are very sad about this incident. You have the freedom to choose the good or the bad, you choose to socialize and make a decision but you are not free in the consequences, you are still responsible for choosing the bad.

                                            Direction: Write TRUE if the statement is correct basing on what you have learned and FALSE if the statement provides otherwise. ________1.. A reader-response asks the reader to examine, explain and defend his/her personal reaction to a reading________2. Reader-response suggests that the role of the reader is essential to the meaning of a text or poetry, for only in the reading experience does the literary work come alive. ________ 3. When writing a reader-response, write as an educated adult addressing other adults or fellow scholars. ________ 4. There is no right or wrong answers to a reader-response. It is important that the critique should demonstrate his or her understanding of the text, book or reading and clearly explain their reactions with supporting details. ________5.. As a beginning scholar, if you write that something has nothing to do with you or does not pass your "Who cares?" test, but many other people think that it is important and great, readers will probably not agree with you that the text is dull or boring. ________6. Use limited quotes as examples of how it agrees with and supports what you think about the world, about right and wrong, and about what you think it is to be human.________7. As a beginning scholar, it is okay not to be cautious of criticizing any text or poem as "confusing" or "crazy," since readers might simply conclude that you are too ignorant or slow to understand and appreciate it.________8. Your "critique" can and should not be positive and not praise the text if possible, as well as pointing out problems, disagreements and shortcomings. ________9. Do NOT use quotes or examples to illustrate the quality of the text as art or entertainment.________ 10. In writing a response you may assume the reader has already read the text or poem. Thus, you can summarize the contents of the text at ength. Instead, take a systematic, analytical approach to the text.​</a>

                            4. Keep in Mind Suggested Time Allotment 10 minutes You have made decisions in the past and will be making still in the coming days, weeks or months. To be better on this, you may want to look back and reflect how you were doing it and be mindful on the learnings that those experiences try to mold in you. Did you have a moment of evaluating your decisions in the past? If so, how did you do it? Here are some pointers for you to make sense out of your past decisions: 1. Did you get the rightful results? Did it really solve your problem? If you answered "yes" to these questions, that's good. If "no", why did you say so? Did your solution create more problems or complications? If that's the case, then, you may take it as a learning experience. Maybe in your next decisions, you can check if your option will really answer the problem or it will create more. If it does, then, it certainly is not the right solution. You could consider other options next time and eliminate the choice that brought you more problems. 2. What were the consequences when you made that decision? What took place after your decision? Did it improve the situation? Did you feel good about it? Decision-making comes with responsibility. It is very ideal for any decision to be favorable for everyone. However, there are times that you need to calculate the risk of your choice. Hence, it has to be a well-calculated one. You are responsible for any decisions that you make. Good or bad, you have to own it. Be wiser with it. 3. Did it contribute to your personal growth in any areas of life (social relationship, academic performance, career pathing, health, spiritual, etc.) With your past decisions, can you identify any significant changes in your life in any aspect of it? For instance, when you decided to continue your studies during this pandemic, did it make a step nearer to your dream of finishing basic education? When you decided to stay at home instead of going out with your friends, did it make any difference to your safety? Try to appreciate whatever gains or personal development you have for any choice that you have. It is a good point of reference for your succeeding decision-making in life. 4. Did it consider the common good? In your past decisions, did it promote the welfare of everyone around you or there are regrets attached to it? There might be times when you are clouded by your personal biases or perceptions. However, the common good would always be a good consideration when weighing your options. At times, there is a need to analyze what is good for you and for everyone. Always try to check what would be good and gain for everyone. Your maturity and experiences aid you to always prioritize the common good. 5. How would that make you as a person?​</h2><br />

What will you do? Explain.Please help me​ </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:  </strong></p><p>Many parents may not realize how often their child is absent from school. A missed day here and there may not seem like a big deal compared to missing several days in a row. But missing just two days a month can add up to a child being considered chronically absent.  Chronic absences keep kids from getting the consistent instruction they need to build on basic skills. For kids with learning and thinking differences, there’s something else to consider: Frequent absences not only mean less instruction, but also missed opportunities for intervention, re-teaching and enrichment.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Chronic absenteeism includes excused absences (like for being sick). It also includes unexcused absences and disciplinary actions, like getting suspended.  Missing a certain number of days—for any reason—triggers schools to start a truancy process. This involves documenting attendance and filing a report with a state agency, local school district and law enforcement.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> </p><p>I.Introduksyon  Naalala mo pa ba? Ang mga panahon na kung saan ang kasiyahan lamang ang mahalaga. Takbo rito, talon diyan, bahay bahayan pati na rin tagu-taguan. Mga araw na puno</p><p>ng mga ngiti at halakhak, mga araw na kailanma’y di malilimutan.</p><p> Lahat ng tao sa mundo ay dumaan sa pagkabata, ang mga panahon na humubog sa  pagkatao ng isang indibidwal. Kaya mainam na bigyan ng mga angkop na aklat, libro at kwento ang mga bata na kanilang kapupulutan ng aral. Ang Panitikang Pambata ay tumutukoy sa mga aklat, istorya o kuwento na isinusulat  para sa mga bata upang bigyan kahalagahan ang moral at sosyal na pakikipag ugnayan, magbigay kasiyahan, maitaguyod ang imahinasyon at kuryosidad pati na rin ang habag at  pakikiramay. Ipinapaliwanag din nito ang lugar ng kabataan sa ating lipunan.</p><p>[1]</p><p> Ang Panitikang Pambata ang siyang sumasalamin sa kung ano ang mga asal na pinahahalagahan ng isang lipunan. Naghahatid ito ng mga mensahe ng kabutihan at kaayusan na siyang hinahangad ng ating bayan. Upang maging makabuluhan ang pagbibigay linaw sa ating kultura, karapat dapat lamang na pag-aralan ang mga panitikang pambata ng ating bansa. Isa sa mga halimbawa nito ay ang mga Nursery Rhymes. Ito ay isang uri ng tula na nilapatan ng musika. Tula na siyang naghahatid ng kwento, nagbibigay aral o nagsisilbing midyum upang magpaliwanag</p><p>ng iba’t ibang konsepto. Ito ay kinawiwilihan dahil sa pagkakaroon nito ng nakasasayang</p><p>tugmaan ng mga tunog tinig at himig.</p><p>[2]</p><p> Hindi lahat ng nursery rhymes ay talagang ginawa para sa mga bata, madalas kasi na nanggaling ito sa mga kantang naririnig nila mula sa kanilang mga <strong>tao</strong></p><br />
