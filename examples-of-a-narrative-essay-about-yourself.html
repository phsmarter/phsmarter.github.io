                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My name is Anthony, I’m 20 years old. I live with my family, which consists of dad, mom, and my sister Lisa, who is two years younger than me. I have brown hair and green eyes. My constitution is average and growth too. I’m quite likable externally, but not as handsome as I would like to be, unfortunately. I respect myself, although I do not try to make myself a leader or head of the company. At the same time, I will not let myself be offended and try to make sure that my opinion is respected by both relatives and friends. I often stand in my opinion. It’s not so easy for me to change it even under the weight of some respectable arguments. Someone can consider that it is wrong, but I like to be independent in everything I am doing. My close people and friends know this feature in me and consider it avoiding unnecessary arguments or conversations. (free essay writing)
</p><p>
</p><p>I studied at school on the average level not being a perfect pupil though trying not to be the last as well. From all of the subjects most of all I liked mathematics, biology, and geography. I like mathematics because it is connected with the logic to me. I enjoy logical games and everything connected to that. I like biology because it gives us insight into the world of creation of everything living on the Earth. It seems amazing and unknown, thus worth to be discovered. I like geography simply because I like to discover different cultures. I would not say that I am a devoted traveler as I mainly enjoy sitting in the comfort of my home. Though, I like to discover something new. Hopefully, nowadays we can travel virtually taking amazing 360-degree tours using smartphones or computers and thus “traveling” everywhere we want from the comfort of the sofa.

                            8. narrative essay about communication issues​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>narrative essay</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Communication is a vital process in organizations and companies in today’s world. It has been defined as an activity that entails transmitting information through interexchange of views or messages by behavior, signals, writing, visuals, and speech. The process of communication requires a sender, the message to be sent, and a receiver. However, it is mandatory for the receiver to be aware of the sender’s intention to communicate. This means that a sender can be able to communicate with a receiver across vast distances (Wilson 2010).
</p><p>
</p><p>Normally, the communication the process is complete after it is clear that the receiver understood the message as intended by the sender. Communicative commonality is integral to effective communication between communicating parties. Effective communication is not only needed inside an organization but also when dealing with external stakeholders. It enables organization to achieve competitive edge considering the fact that it through it that an organization remains responsive to consumer needs (Jones &amp; George 2007). On the contrary, poor communication disrupts almost everything in an organization.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a number of barriers to effective communication (Huczynski &amp; Buchanan 2010). This paper intends to highlight the barriers and how three organizations (Professional Sports, Bernard Mathews, and NHS trust Hospital) have been able to handle the barriers to ensure effective communication. Barriers to Effective Communication Barriers to communication are factors that might hinder effective communication between parties in the workplace. According to Antony and MacVicar (2011), this includes language barriers, cultural barriers, organizational barriers, personal barriers, and interpersonal barriers.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Communication Issues
</p><p>Each of us communicate on a daily basis, but oftentimes we miscommunicate and do not get our intended point across. There are a lot of guidelines that help to make for more effective communications, one being is to have eye contact with the person you are communicating with. By looking at the person it shows that a you are interested in what the person is saying and are paying attention and is engaged with the conversation. By a lack of eye contact with another other person, it shows that you are disinterested in the conversation. By practicing direct eye contact with the person you are speaking to, will assist in maintaining good lines of communication. Besides, eye contact, it is important to be a good listener. By asking “What” and “Why” questions it will ensure that you are attentive to the what the person is saying. In effective communications between two people, it is important that each individual understand what message is being communicated. It also important to reflect upon what a person has said when there is a pause in the communication. This allows for each individual to think about the conversation and maintain a continuous flow of the conversation. It should be noted that good communications between individuals is a two-way street.
</p><p>As for me personally, there are a lot of situations that has made me a good listener. Oftentimes, I was interrupting the people who were speaking and not listening to what they were talking about. There was a problem for me to be attentive to the details of conversation and I had not listened to them during the conversation and forgetting most everything that was said. One day during a conversation, a friend told me that my problem was that I was not a good listener. They went on to say that I needed to develop more effective listening skills. They suggested that during a conversation, I should focus on a what is being said, remain silent until the speaker has completed what they were saying. In turn, it would show to the speaker that I was interested in what they were saying. It should also be noted that during a conversation, the subject should not be changed as it will disrupt the communication process. When engaged in conversation, I should put aside my own thoughts and intently listen to what the person is saying. I should place all of my attention to the speaker and not hurry the speaker before they have completed what they are saying.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps...</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Political corruption has existed throughout the ages. It believed to be most prominent in positions of power, because of the role money plays in getting people power. However, over the centuries, corruption has changed so much so as to not match a particular definition of corruption, perpetually growing deceptively harder to find (Ebbe). </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The broadest, most suitable definition which exists today simply states that corruption is any illegal act performed by a politician to produce results which would have been otherwise impossible (Ebbe).  In some cases, government, politicians, and criminals entwine for the sake of amassing money in order to secure their own jobs. This form of corruption was apparent in the mafia’s association</p><p></p><p>This paired with poor law enforcement yields an impossibly hard to get rid of corruption. In Kenya, political corruption has grown rampant. People, who are supposed to be representing the interests of their constituency, instead take money from the constituents to keep their representative positions. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Political corruption is parasitic; it finds a host, and can almost always find a way to survive. Eventually, people grow dependent on this corruption as a means for income, thus forming a symbiosis between the people who benefit from it, and the elites that regulate it. People sometimes ignore the corruption surrounding them, feeling that as long as the politicians do their jobs well, their ‘extra salary’ can’t hurt (BNS).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Generally after revolutions take place, anarchy exists. No new government simply moves into place. During this time, it is easiest for Corruption to take hold of this Government as it forms, limiting or halting the true development of a government for the people. In an environment infested with corruption, any acts of corruption simply become commonplace. Where anarchy exists, people lack the power of representation. If there is a government in which corruption exists, people lack a voice with which to take action.  A government is necessary for the growth of people and nations as a whole. If the government is not legitimate, it will only act as a parasite to its host--the people and the country’s economy.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ABM, or Accountancy, Business, and Management, is a strand in the senior high school curriculum in the Philippines. As a student who took ABM, I can say that it has provided me with valuable knowledge and skills that I can use in my future career.</p><p></p><p>When I first entered senior high school, I had little idea of what ABM was all about. All I knew was that it was a strand that was related to business and accounting. However, as I progressed through my classes, I began to appreciate the value of the ABM curriculum.</p><p></p><p>One of the things that I found most interesting about ABM was the focus on accounting. We learned about bookkeeping, financial statements, and taxation, which are all essential skills for anyone who wants to pursue a career in accounting or finance. We also learned about economics, business management, and entrepreneurship, which helped us gain a better understanding of how businesses operate and how to manage them effectively.</p><p></p><p>The ABM curriculum was not just about theoretical knowledge. We also had practical exercises that involved analyzing financial statements, creating business plans, and conducting market research. These activities gave us hands-on experience and helped us develop critical thinking skills.</p><p></p><p>Another thing that I appreciated about ABM was the sense of community among my classmates. We often worked on group projects and presentations, which allowed us to collaborate and learn from one another. We also had supportive teachers who were always willing to answer our questions and guide us through our studies.</p><p></p><p>Overall, taking ABM was a rewarding experience for me. It has given me a solid foundation in accounting, business, and management, which I can apply in my future career. It has also helped me develop important skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork. I am grateful for the opportunity to have taken this strand and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in pursuing a career in business or accounting.</p><br />

                            24. narrative essay about hemophilia​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>            Hemophilia is a rare genetic bleeding disorder that causes the blood to clot abnormally. People born with hemophilia are lacking or have very clotting factor, which is the protein needed for blood to clot normally. The clotting factor works together with platelets to clot blood by helping the platelets to stick together and plug cuts on the vessel. This stops the bleeding. A person can have mild, moderate, or severe Hemophilia, depending on how much clotting factor they have. A person without Hemophilia has 100% of these clotting factors, while a person with severe Hemophilia has less than one percent. </p><p>            The disease is more common in men, affecting approximately one in 5,000 each year. this is because the Hemophilia gene is only located on the X chromosome. Men have one X and one Y chromosome, which means that if the X chromosome has the faulty gene, they will be born with Hemophilia. Women, however, have two X chromosomes. They will only be born with Hemophilia if both X chromosomes have the bad gene. If only one has it, the woman becomes a carrier of the disease. This means that she doesn’t have the disease, but she is able to pass it on to her children. A female can be born with Hemophilia if her dad has it and her mom is a carrier of it. Although Hemophilia is a genetic disease, some males are born with it even if neither of their parents have it. </p><p>               An individual with Hemophilia should know all of the signs and symptoms of the disease, as well as when it is necessary to go to the doctor or emergency room such as: very heavy continuous bleeding, limited motion, pain or swelling of the joints, or any signs of bleeding in the brain as these can be life threatening. When dealing with children who have hemophilia, it is best to inform them about the disease that they have, as well as put them in support groups. They should be protected with kneepads, elbow pads, and helmets when biking or doing similar activities. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Hemophilia is usually <strong>an inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly.</strong> This can lead to spontaneous bleeding as well as bleeding following injuries or surgery.<p>Hemophilia is usually an inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly.

                        <p>                                    <strong>BEST FRIENDS FOR LIFE
</strong></p><p>“It was the 4th of July, and the summer heat was as blistering as ever in New Mexico. Lilly-Ann, Daniela, and I – the three best friends – set out to go on a girly picnic as we would every year since we were nine years old. I had done all my chores and packed the picnic basket the night before, so as soon as I brushed my teeth and had a coffee, I was ready to dress up and go have a good time with my besties. I took my beat-up Cherokee and sped down the street to meet up with Daniela; we would pick Lilly-Ann later.
</p><p>
</p><p>Daniela and I shared the same birthday – February 27th, 1986. Our moms were also best friends from high school. They went to the same college and got married the same year. Everyone always laughed at how it all resembled a generic best-friends-for-life movie or novel. It seemed like Daniela and I were destined to be best friends. Neither of us had siblings, so we became much like sisters to each other. We shared all interests and hobbies without exception. We both joined the school’s female soccer team, and both played in the defense. But, most important of all, we were always there for each other in the toughest of situations, regardless of how preoccupied either of us might have been.
</p><p>
</p><p>Our traditional spot for Independence Day picnic was on the bank of the Beaver River. Here, half a mile west from the town, it is always as cool as it gets in July in New Mexico. As we were riding the rocky backroad, my bike was screaking in unison with the fireworks that exploded in the clear sky from the early morning.
</p><p>
</p><p>The meadow on our spot always inspired us to go play a little soccer, as we did this time as well. Then, we felt like we need to fresh up a little, so we went into the river. We even managed to catch a small catfish, but we let it go. The ride, the soccer, and the swim made us hungry, and we sat down to have some lunch. We all always pack a little more food than we need for a picnic, so we always have something of a menu to choose from. We all picked Lilly-Ann’s roasted chicken with pineapple and mashed potatoes. During and after the meal, we chattered and giggled non-stop as besties like us always would. Then suddenly, Daniela seized laughing and stared blankly into the water for a moment or two.
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Stunned, without the slightest idea of what was going on, all I could mumble was a faint “I promise.”
</p><p>
</p><p>By this time, it began to get dark, and my dad had already texted me asking about my whereabouts. So, we rushed home. Lilly-Ann’s place was the nearest to the river, then was Daniela’s, and mine wasthe farthest. As Daniela and I said goodbye and I sat on the bike to be on my way, she was still on the porch waving goodbye and shouted “Remember your promise,” reminding me of something I couldn’t wish to forget anyway.
</p><p>
</p><p>These words ring through my head to this day. A pitch black mustang rolled from around the corner and headed our way.
</p><p>
</p><p>“Dani…” I cried out as I leaped off the bike and to the side.
</p><p>
</p><p>Stunned by the loud skiddle of tires and screams, I passed out. After I came to my sense, the first thing I saw was Daniela’s limp body in her mother’s hands as I heard hysterical weeping. My head suddenly felt heavy, and my legs felt cotton-like. Dazed, I landed on my behind in slow motion. The air felt thick and heavy, and I fainted once more. The next thing I remember is waking up in my bed and seeing my mother sitting next to me, sobbing.
</p><p>
</p><p>I urged to tell her about my promise, but all I could utter was “Why her?” – and then I burst into tears myself.
</p><p>
</p><p>Nobody can take their best friend’s death well. I became antisocial. I barely left my room, and whenever someone tried to talk to me about anything, I responded with brief and bitter remarks. I wallowed in myself. Whirlwinds of thoughts circled in my head – Why Daniela? Of all people, why did she have to die? Couldn’t God pick someone more deserving of death? I could not imagine how I was supposed to live on without her. Nobody could replace her in my life, not even all the people in the world.
</p><p>
</p><p>After one month of grieving, I finally found the strength to talk to my mother. “Does God love us?” I asked, “Why does he hurt us?” “My girl,” she said, “He picks the best of us and takes them before the cruel world can deform them. He turns them into His angels, and Daniela must be your angel now.”
</p><p>
