Your work will be evaluated using the given rubric.
a
Think of a time when you had to explain one message in two different instances with
varying contexts. For example, you want to tell your parents that you want to attend your
special someone's birthday party tonight and in another instance, you talked about the
same thing with your friends during your vacant time.
In an essay with a minimum of 300 words, discuss why your communicative
strategies change as there are adjustments in every speech context, speech style, and
speech act. Discuss your language, duration of interaction, your relationship to the
listener, your roles and responsibilities as a speaker, your message, and your delivery
and how these differ in the two varying instances and contexts.</a>
