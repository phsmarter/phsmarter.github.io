However, thecost of the fare is just one of the factors. There are times that convenience is alsoconsidered in choosing the mode of transportation since it is not crowded and youcan reach your destination faster. Therefore, in deciding the mode of transportationthe priority of the commuters whether to be more economical or to meet convenienceis consideredIn the previous problem we determine the cost of the fare by using a table whereinwe repeatedly add the fare charge per kilometer. Thus, this type of problem can besolved using functions, and at this point let us determine how we are going to dothat.Example no. 1LET'S TRAVELA proposed Light Rail Transit System Line 1 (LRT-1) fare would charge P18.00 forthe first four stations and P5.00 for each additional station over the proposed fare.a.

                                            Direction: 
Below is a sample definition of democracy by Saqueton and Uychoco (2016). Read the text then fill out the table that follows. 
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally – either directly or through elected representatives – in the proposal, development, and creation of laws.
It encompasses social, economic, and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. 
The term originates from the Greek “demokratia” or rule of the people, which was coined from “demos” (people) and “kratos” (power or rule) in the 5th century BCE to denote the political systems them existing in Greek city-states, notable Athens. 
The term is an antonym to ‘aristokratia’ which means ‘rule of an elite’. WBLS-OBE MELC-Aligned Self-Learning Module English 11 - EAPP 10 While theoretically, these definitions are in opposition, in practice, the distinction has been blurred historically. 
The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. 
In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of all elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. 
The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy. 
Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements. 
Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution. 
There were five (5) techniques used in defining the concept. Your challenge is to identify all five and write the sentences where these techniques can be found.

Question text
Read the following narrative essay: 
Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

Read the following narrative essay: 
I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

A . free fall b. dropped c. thrown downward d. thrown upward
10. A freely falling body experiences constant acceleration due to gravity, denoted by the 
letter g. Since the direction of the acceleration is downward, the value of g is −9.8ms.
a. constant acceleration b. acceleration c. Air resistance d. Free fall motion
11. All objects regardless of their sizes and mass fall with the same __________ if air 
resistance is neglected.
a. constant acceleration b. acceleration c. Air resistance d. Free fall motion
12. it refers to a frictional force which opposes the motion of a falling object. It increases 
with the speed and the surface area of the object.
a. constant acceleration b. acceleration c. Air resistance d. Free fall motion
13. This term applies to an object dropped from rest, object thrown downward, and object 
thrown upward.
a. constant acceleration b. acceleration c. Air resistance d. Free fall motion14. It is also known as the Law of Inertia. An object’s momentum is also known as inertia 
in motion
A. Law of Inertia b. law of motion c. law of interaction d. impulse
15. A special name is given to the product of the force applied and the time interval 
during which it acts: impulse. 
A. Law of Inertia b. law of motion c. law of interaction d. impulse
II. True or False: Write the word true if the statement is correct; and false if otherwise.
1. If a body maintains a constant change in its velocity in a given time interval along a 
straight line, then the body is said to have a uniform acceleration
2. Uniform accelerated motion can be described using the magnitude and direction of the 
velocity and acceleration of the body.
3. Another example of free-fall is a body thrown upward. 
4. The faster the object is falling, the higher the air resistance
5. All objects regardless of their sizes and mass fall with the same acceleration if air 
resistance is neglected.
6. In physics, an external force acting on an object over a specific time leads to a change in 
momentum of the object
7. Collisions are categorized according to whether the total kinetic energy of the system 
changes.
8. The total momentum of the system is conserved before and after the collision.
9. Chemical, electrical and nuclear energies in general exhibit characteristics that are 
electromagnetic in nature...though they also have potential energy
10. Energy is simply transformed from one form to another or transferred from one system 
to another
11. A body falling freely constantly increases its velocity
12. If there is no change in velocity, the acceleration of the body is zero.
13. If the acceleration and velocity are both in the positive direction, the body is moving with 
positive uniform acceleration.
14. If the acceleration and velocity are in opposite directions, the body is moving with 
negative uniform acceleration
15. Galileo proposed that all objects experienced the same downward acceleration when 
neglecting the effect of air resistance.
III. Enumeration:
two types of collisions
1.
2. 
Four(4) equations that can be used in solving for one-dimensional problems involving 
uniform acceleration.
3.

There are times that convenience is alsoconsidered in choosing the mode of transportation since it is not crowded and youcan reach your destination faster. Therefore, in deciding the mode of transportationthe priority of the commuters whether to be more economical or to meet convenienceis consideredIn the previous problem we determine the cost of the fare by using a table whereinwe repeatedly add the fare charge per kilometer. Thus, this type of problem can besolved using functions, and at this point let us determine how we are going to dothat.Example no. 1LET'S TRAVELA proposed Light Rail Transit System Line 1 (LRT-1) fare would charge P18.00 forthe first four stations and P5.00 for each additional station over the proposed fare.a.

                            5. Direction: 
Below is a sample definition of democracy by Saqueton and Uychoco (2016). Read the text then fill out the table that follows. 
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally – either directly or through elected representatives – in the proposal, development, and creation of laws.
It encompasses social, economic, and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. 
The term originates from the Greek “demokratia” or rule of the people, which was coined from “demos” (people) and “kratos” (power or rule) in the 5th century BCE to denote the political systems them existing in Greek city-states, notable Athens. 
The term is an antonym to ‘aristokratia’ which means ‘rule of an elite’. WBLS-OBE MELC-Aligned Self-Learning Module English 11 - EAPP 10 While theoretically, these definitions are in opposition, in practice, the distinction has been blurred historically. 
The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. 
In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of all elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. 
The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy. 
Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements. 
Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution. 
There were five (5) techniques used in defining the concept. Your challenge is to identify all five and write the sentences where these techniques can be found.

Read the following narrative essay: 
Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy.

changes.
8. The total momentum of the system is conserved before and after the collision.
9. Chemical, electrical and nuclear energies in general exhibit characteristics that are 
electromagnetic in nature...though they also have potential energy
10. Energy is simply transformed from one form to another or transferred from one system 
to another
11. A body falling freely constantly increases its velocity
12. If there is no change in velocity, the acceleration of the body is zero.
13. If the acceleration and velocity are both in the positive direction, the body is moving with 
positive uniform acceleration.
14. If the acceleration and velocity are in opposite directions, the body is moving with 
negative uniform acceleration
