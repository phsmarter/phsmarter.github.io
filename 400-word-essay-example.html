                            1. 400 word essay about poverty​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"Poverty is the worst form of violence”. – Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p></p><p>We can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, etc. A poor person is not able to get education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A  jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems.</p><p></p><p>How Poverty is Measured?</p><p></p><p>For measuring poverty United nations have devised two measures of poverty – Absolute &amp; relative poverty.  Absolute poverty is used to measure poverty in developing countries like India. Relative poverty is used to measure poverty in developed countries like the USA. In absolute poverty, a line based on the minimum level of income has been created &amp; is called a poverty line.  If per day income of a family is below this level, then it is poor or below the poverty line. If per day income of a family is above this level, then it is non-poor or above the poverty line. In India, the new poverty line is  Rs 32 in rural areas and Rs 47 in urban areas.</p><p></p><p>Causes of Poverty</p><p></p><p>According to the Noble prize winner South African leader, Nelson Mandela – “Poverty is not natural, it is manmade”. The above statement is true as the causes of poverty are generally man-made. There are various causes of poverty but the most important is population. Rising population is putting the burden on the resources &amp; budget of countries. Governments are finding difficult to provide food, shelter &amp; employment to the rising population.</p><p></p><p>The other causes are- lack of education, war, natural disaster, lack of employment, lack of infrastructure, political instability, etc. For instance- lack of employment opportunities makes a person jobless &amp; he is not able to earn enough to fulfill the basic necessities of his family &amp; becomes poor. Lack of education compels a person for less paying jobs &amp; it makes him poorer. Lack of infrastructure means there are no industries, banks, etc. in a country resulting in lack of employment opportunities. Natural disasters like flood, earthquake also contribute to poverty.</p><p></p><p>In some countries, especially African countries like Somalia, a long period of civil war has made poverty widespread. This is because all the resources &amp; money is being spent in war instead of public welfare. Countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc. are prone to natural disasters like cyclone, etc. These disasters occur every year causing poverty to rise.</p><p></p><p>Ill Effects of Poverty</p><p></p><p>Poverty affects the life of a poor family. A poor person is not able to take proper food &amp; nutrition &amp;his capacity to work reduces. Reduced capacity to work further reduces his income, making him poorer. Children from poor family never get proper schooling &amp; proper nutrition. They have to work to support their family &amp; this destroys their childhood. Some of them may also involve in crimes like theft, murder, robbery, etc. A poor person remains uneducated &amp; is forced to live under unhygienic conditions in slums. There are no proper sanitation &amp; drinking water facility in slums &amp; he falls ill often &amp;  his health deteriorates. A poor person generally dies an early death. So, all social evils are related to poverty.</p><p></p><p>Government Schemes to Remove Poverty</p><p></p><p>The government of India also took several measures to eradicate poverty from India. Some of them are – creating employment opportunities, controlling population, etc. In India, about 60% of the population is still dependent on agriculture for its livelihood. Government has taken certain measures to promote agriculture in India. The government constructed certain dams &amp; canals in our country to provide easy availability of water for irrigation. Government has also taken steps for the cheap availability of seeds &amp; farming equipment to promote agriculture. Government is also promoting farming of cash crops like cotton, instead of food crops. In cities, the government is promoting industrialization to create more jobs. Government has also opened  ‘Ration shops’. Other measures include providing free &amp; compulsory education for children up to 14 years of age, scholarship to deserving students from a poor background, providing subsidized houses to poor people, etc.</p><p></p><p>Poverty is a social evil, we can also contribute to control it. For example- we can simply donate old clothes to poor people, we can also sponsor the education of a poor child or we can utilize our free time by teaching poor students. Remember before wasting food, somebody is still sleeping hungry.</p><p></p><br />

                            5. 400 words ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY about Implementation of 24-Hour Curfew for Minors in the Time of Pandemic​.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY</strong></p><p>Theme:</p><p>Implementation of 24-Hour Curfew for Minors in the Time of Pandemic​.​</p><p></p><p><strong>STATEMENT:</strong></p><p>In an effort to combat the spread of the coronavirus, the government of the Philippines imposed several restrictions, including a nighttime curfew in the nation's capital and the directive that residents of densely populated areas should only leave their homes during the daytime for work or errands of an urgent nature.</p><p>Officials have stated that the temporary restrictions will not amount to a lockdown of the nation's capital because large numbers of workers, emergency personnel such as medical staff, and residents running urgent errands will be able to move freely within the metropolitan area or enter and exit the area after presenting valid identification documents. The transport of goods and the delivery of food will go without interruption.</p><p></p><p><strong>SUPPORT:</strong></p><p>The commander of police in Metropolitan Manila, Major General D. Sinas, has issued a caution that individuals will be get warn or caught up if they do not comply with the limits. There will be a deployment of thousands of police officers, and checkpoints will be put up in the portal to the metropolitan Manila area.</p><p></p><p><strong>FACTS: </strong></p><p>If by "24 hour curfew" you mean keeping the young monsters home 24/7, one benefit would be that they would spread the Covid virus less between themselves. Another benefit would be that they would have more time to play. If you have fewer interactions with other people, there will be less chance of the virus spreading.</p><p>The fact that the young kid will spend their entire day at home is one of the drawbacks. For the sake of the children's protection as well as the safety of others and the home itself, a parent is required to be present in the dwelling whenever the children are there. One major drawback is that parents who are forced to keep their children at home around the clock may experience a decline in their mental health as a result of the situation.</p><p></p><p><strong>STATISTICS: </strong></p><p>Although the virus can be fatal, particularly for the elderly and those who already have other health problems, most individuals who get infected with it only experience mild to moderate symptoms, such as a fever and a cough. Some people do not have any symptoms at all, while the overwhelming majority of people are able to recover.</p><p></p><p><strong>EXAMPLES: </strong></p><p>Local Government Units (LGUs) such as barangay councils or city councils may impose curfews by means of legitimate ordinances. Again, this is something that can be done by lawful directives issued by provincial bodies, Congress, and the President.</p><p></p><p><strong>EXPERT AUTHORITY:</strong></p><p>The implementation of a curfew must not be arbitrary, unreasonable, or disproportionate, according to the official's statements. When judged by these criteria, the blanket 24-hour curfews with hazy or nonexistent exclusions or exemptions that are imposed through ordinances by some local government units are subject to significant legal scrutiny and could be overturned.</p><p></p><p><strong>LOGIC AND REASONING: </strong></p><p>Dictate that law enforcement officers are unable to detain anyone for disobeying emergency health requirements. If a person has already committed a crime or is likely to commit a crime, the police are allowed to arrest them without a warrant. In the event that appropriate measures to manage the outbreak are not put into place, the number of infections in the Philippines may skyrocket to several thousand in just five months.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about Argumentative Essays here:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/24017255</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Typhoon Rai, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Odette, was a powerful and catastrophic tropical cyclone that struck the Philippines in December 2021. Rai became the first Category 5-equivalent super typhoon to develop in the month of December since Nock-ten in 2016, and the third Category 5 super typhoon recorded in the South China Sea, following Pamela in 1954 and Rammasun in 2014. The 22nd tropical storm, the ninth typhoon, and the fifth super typhoon of the 2021 Pacific typhoon season, the system originated from a tropical disturbance near the equator on December 10, forming near the site of another low-pressure area that had dissipated on the previous day. Conditions around the system were favorable for further development, and it slowly developed into a tropical depression on December 12. On the same day, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the consolidating depression. Further intensification ensued, and Rai was upgraded to a tropical storm the next day, before passing south of Ngulu Atoll. After passing near Palau and impacting the island nation, Rai entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) by the night of December 14, where the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) named it "Odette". On the next day, both the JMA and JTWC raised the system's intensity to a low-end Category 1-equivalent typhoon, as an eye continued to appear.</p><p></p><br />

There has been a dramatic increase in the amount of money being sent back home, and<strong> OFWs </strong>are to blame. <strong>The Philippines</strong> has seen an increase in remittances sent to the country.</p><p>Our government has charged these organizations with assisting both prospective <strong>OFWs</strong> as they prepare to leave the nation and returning <strong>OFWs</strong> who have accrued significant financial and other obligations.</p><p>Over the course of the previous few years, remittances from overseas workers have climbed gradually to exceed $25 billion annually. Since most of the money sent home by <strong>OFWs</strong> is used to purchase goods and services, it has a direct impact on local economies (the multiplier effect).</p><p>In order to better protect and promote overseas <strong>Filipino workers (OFWs)</strong>, the government of <strong>the Philippines created the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW)</strong> to coordinate all of the various government departments and inter-government organizations working on their behalf.</p><p>Construction jobs in <strong>the United States</strong> have been a major source of temporary <strong>Filipino</strong> migration since the 1960s, when the U.S. government, military contractors, and civilian agencies first started actively recruiting <strong>Filipinos</strong> for these positions, according to <strong>the Philippine Department</strong> of <strong>Labor </strong>and <strong>Employment</strong>.</p><p>Therefore, the current account surplus has increased thanks to these remittances, enhancing the country's balance of payments.

                        <p>War is a destructive and devastating force that has wreaked havoc on societies throughout human history. It results in loss of life, displacement of people, destruction of infrastructure and economies, and creates long-lasting scars on communities and individuals. The physical, emotional, and psychological toll of war is immense, and it is a fact that war can never be considered good.</p><p></p><p>Peace, on the other hand, is an ideal that has been sought after by people throughout the ages. It is characterized by the absence of conflict, cooperation between nations, and a sense of security and stability. When peace is established, it allows for growth and prosperity, creates a positive environment for individuals and communities to thrive, and provides the foundation for sustainable development.</p><p></p><p>The impact of war on societies is well-documented, and it is clear that the costs of war far outweigh any potential benefits. War creates a sense of fear and insecurity, leading to a breakdown in the social fabric of communities and the displacement of people from their homes. The loss of life and property can take years to recover from, and the economic impact of war can be felt for generations to come. Furthermore, war often leads to the creation of refugees, who are forced to flee their homes in search of safety. This exacerbates poverty and creates a cycle of marginalization and inequality, making it difficult for communities to recover from the impacts of war.</p><p></p><p>Peace, on the other hand, provides a sense of stability and security that allows individuals, communities, and nations to thrive. When peace is established, individuals are free to pursue their goals and dreams, businesses can operate without fear of disruption, and economies can grow and develop. Furthermore, peace creates an environment where cooperation and collaboration between nations can thrive, leading to the development of mutually beneficial relationships and the creation of new opportunities for growth and development.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, it is clear that war is never good and peace is never bad. While there may be instances where war appears to be necessary, the long-term impacts of war far outweigh any potential benefits. In contrast, peace is a vital component of sustainable development and provides the foundation for growth and prosperity. The promotion of peace should be a priority for all nations, as it creates a positive environment for individuals, communities, and nations to thrive.</p><p></p><br />

                            12. Make an essay that relates to the sociopolitical context. Express your answer in 400-500 words.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The sociopolitical context refers to the ways in which social and political structures, values, and norms interact and shape our lives. In today's world, there are numerous examples of how this dynamic plays out, both positively and negatively.</p><p>One of the most pressing issues in the current sociopolitical context is the growing income inequality and poverty that affects communities around the world. This inequality is fueled by a variety of factors, including globalization, technological advancements, and government policies. The result is that many people are being left behind as the benefits of economic growth are concentrated in the hands of a small, wealthy elite.</p><p>In response to this growing inequality, there has been a growing movement of people calling for greater social and economic justice. This has manifested in a number of ways, including protests, strikes, and campaigns for fair wages and working conditions. These efforts are driven by a belief that everyone deserves a fair shot at success and that a just society is one in which everyone has the opportunity to fulfill their potential.</p><p>Another important aspect of the sociopolitical context is the ongoing struggle for civil rights and equality. Despite many advances over the past few decades, discrimination and prejudice continue to be major challenges for many marginalized groups. For example, people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, and women still face significant barriers to equal treatment and opportunities in many areas of life.</p><p>In response to this, there has been a growing movement of people fighting for greater equality and justice for all. This includes activism around issues such as police brutality, reproductive rights, and marriage equality. These efforts are fueled by a belief that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and that a just society is one in which everyone has equal opportunities and protections under the law.</p><p>Another important issue in the current sociopolitical context is the threat of climate change. Climate change is having devastating impacts on communities around the world, from extreme weather events to rising sea levels and shrinking ice caps. Despite the growing evidence of the threat that climate change poses, there are still many individuals and organizations that deny its existence or refuse to take action to mitigate its impacts.</p><p>In response to this challenge, there has been a growing movement of people calling for greater action to address climate change. This includes efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote renewable energy sources, and protect ecosystems and biodiversity. These efforts are driven by a belief that we have a moral obligation to protect the planet and ensure a sustainable future for future generations.</p><p>In conclusion, the sociopolitical context is shaped by a variety of social, political, and economic factors. Whether it be the struggle for economic justice and equality, the fight for civil rights and equality, or the need to address the threat of climate change, there are numerous challenges facing communities around the world. However, there is also hope and promise, as there are growing movements of people working to make the world a better and more just place for everyone.</p><br />

                        THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA BACK-UP<p></p><p>One of a company's most important assets is its<strong> data</strong>. Keeping such information secure and reliably accessible is more important than ever as businesses gather larger amounts of data and store them across the organization—from on-premises data centers to <strong>hybrid</strong> cloud architectures.  </p><p><strong>Data management</strong> is vitally<strong> important</strong>, and making backups of acquired data is essential. Backups shield <strong>information</strong> against human <strong>mistake</strong>, hardware malfunction, virus assaults, power outages, and natural catastrophes. If these errors do occur, backups can help you save time and money.</p><p>There are more and more <strong>dangers</strong> to such data. <strong>Phishing</strong>,<strong> ransomware</strong>, and other <strong>malicious </strong>assaults can severely impair your productivity and result in data loss that is financially ruinous.  </p><p>Data is not just at<strong> risk</strong> from attacks. Critical data loss might result from a simple human mistake. Data loss and power disruption are two additional effects of natural catastrophes including hurricanes, floods, and fires.  </p><p>Every company requires a<strong> reliable</strong> data backup and system recovery solution that can support it in surviving unforeseen occurrences and even thriving.</p><p></p>BEST PRACTICES FOR DATA BACK-UP:The 3-2-1 rule is changing as cloud or internet backups become more prevalent. For instance, many experts advise making two geographically distinct cloud copies of your data when you back it up to the cloud. Businesses nowadays are combining local and cloud backup techniques to build a solution that best suits their requirements.<strong> Cloud storage</strong> is necessary for saving backups to the cloud, and some online backup suppliers provide limitless cloud storage when you use their backup services.  What to look in a solution - <strong>Easy</strong> to use, straightforward scalability, quick recovery times, system security, vendor dependability, and level of vendor support are a few key factors to take into account when selecting a business data backup solution.   Create a plan, then try it out. What data has to be<strong> backed</strong> up and how often will be <strong>specified </strong>by an intelligent data backup and recovery plan. For example, it may not be necessary to back up certain ephemeral data, but business-critical data may require numerous daily backups.<p>Any organization might<strong> suffer</strong> grave consequences from losing critical data. Your personnel will have to put a lot of time into retrieving and recreating the data if papers are lost forever. This may result in lower <strong>productivity</strong> levels and perhaps the entire shutdown of your company. In actuality, the average cost of a data breach event is $4.24 million, according to recent statistics. </p><p>Your<strong> capacity </strong>to create money can also be impacted if your company is unable to function as a result of missing data. </p><p>Nothing is more<strong> annoying </strong>than working on a project for hours in front of a computer only to lose everything due to an accident or technical glitch. Unfortunately, these occurrences happen more frequently than you may imagine, which makes many teams anxious. </p><p>Although it might be<strong> unsettling </strong>to consider losing crucial data, there are steps you can do to safeguard your company. <strong>Investing</strong> in data backup and recovery solutions is one of the most efficient options.</p><p>To understand more on Data Back-up, kindly click this link below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2152537</p><p></p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p><p></p><br />

A communication strategy ensures that everyone involved has adequate information to communicate about it, maintaining consistency in the workplace and preventing any ambiguity.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A communication strategy ensures that all significant information is dispersed to the correct people, both internally and externally. Having all people on the same page is essential to a highly efficient workplace.

                            16. essay about sa feet binding 400 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Foot binding, also known as "lotus feet," was a traditional practice in ancient China where young girls had their feet tightly bound to prevent them from growing properly. This practice was prevalent in China for over a thousand years and was considered a symbol of beauty and wealth despite being painful and harmful.</p><p></p><p>The process of foot binding typically began when a girl was around five or six years old. The feet were soaked in hot water to soften them, and then the toes were curled under and held in place with bandages. Over time, the bandages were tightened, and the feet were forced to become smaller and smaller. The process was extremely painful, and many girls suffered from infections and other foot-related health problems as a result.</p><p></p><p>Foot binding was a symbol of beauty and status in ancient China because it was believed that small feet were more attractive and feminine. Women with small feet were considered more desirable and were more likely to marry into wealthy families. Thus, foot binding became a way for families to improve their social status and ensure their daughters' future success.</p><p></p><p>However, foot binding was not just a symbol of beauty and status; it was also a way to control women's behavior. Women with bound feet were less mobile and less able to work outside the home, which made it easier for men to control their movements and keep them in the domestic sphere. Foot binding was thus considered a way to create obedient and submissive wives.</p><p></p><p>Despite its harmful effects, foot binding continued for over a thousand years in China, until it was finally banned in the early 20th century. The ban was part of a wider effort to modernize China and eliminate harmful traditional practices. Today, foot binding is no longer practiced in China, but the legacy of this harmful practice lives on. Many elderly women in China still suffer from the consequences of foot binding, including chronic pain and disability.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, foot binding was a harmful practice that persisted in China for over a thousand years. It was a symbol of beauty and status, but it was also a way to control women's behavior and keep them in the domestic sphere. Today, foot binding is no longer practiced in China, but its legacy continues to affect many elderly women who suffered from this painful and damaging practice. It serves as a reminder of the harmful effects of traditional practices that prioritize beauty and status over health and well-being.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yan po 400 words</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Our sexual attitudes are shaped by our parents, peer groups, media and teachers. Where you are born, who your parents and family are, your culture, religion and social circumstances will all have a profound influence on your sexual attitudes. Your friends will be very influential in shaping your ideas about sex.Sexuality covers a broad spectrum, and is also deeply personal. It's about understanding the sexual feelings and attractions we feel towards others, not who we happen to have sex with. There are different types of sexuality, and it can take time to figure out what fits right with you.Sexual orientation — being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or straight — is about sexual attraction. All of these sexual orientations are perfectly normal.Being supported and safe to explore and express your sexuality can be good for your mental health. It can reduce distress, anxiety, and depression.

                        <p><strong>Communicating or Communication helps people to express their ideas and feelings, and it, at the same time, helps us understand emotion and thoughts of others. As a result, we will develop affection or hatred toward other people, and positive or negative relationships will be created.</strong></p><p><strong>In daily life we need to communicate to deal with various concerns and problems of daily life. In professional life also, it is communication that helps us to build healthy relations and credibility with co-workers. Only speaking/talking is not communication. Communication can take place in many forms. </strong></p><p><strong>Communication is one of the important tools that aid us to connect with other people. Either you are a student or a working professional, good communication is something that will connect you far ahead. Proper communication can help you solve a number of issues and resolve problems. This is the reason that one must know how to communicate well. The skills of communication essential to be developed so that you are able to interact with people. And able to share your thoughts and reach out to them. All this needs the correct guidance and self-analysis as well. Communication also brings people together, closer to each other.</strong></p><p><strong>And being able to communicate effectively is perhaps the most important of all life skills. It is what enables us to pass information to other people and to understand what is said to us. Communication, at its simplest, is the act of transferring information from one place to another.</strong></p><p><strong>Being able to communicate well is important. There will be different people to communicate with. This includes family and different health professionals. Some of the information here may help to make this easier. When you are seriously ill, there will be many things that need to be discussed. Some of these discussions may be difficult and emotional. It is important that your voice is heard.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Your family and friends will be concerned about what is happening. They may have a lot of questions and concerns. It is helpful to think about how to manage these conversations. How do you want to share your information and who with? The people you are important to will also have their needs to share with you. You may not know how to talk to people about what is happening. There are health professionals who can support you with this.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Consider choosing someone in the family to talk to everyone. Setting up a telephone tree may help. This is where each person contacts someone else. This shares the time involved in keeping everybody up to date. It also means that not everyone is calling you or your health professionals for an update.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Talking is not the only way we communicate. Sometimes sitting quietly together can be enough.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Communication is one of the most important factors in our lives.(THESIS STATEMENT) (INTRODUCTION)It dictates the relationships formed with the individuals in personal and professional lives. Effective communication provides a foundation for trust and respect to grow. It also helps better understand a person and the context of the conversation. Individuals often believe that their communication skills are much better than what they actually are.Communication appears effortless; however, much of what two people discuss gets misunderstood, thus leading to conflicts and distress. To communicate effectively, one must understand the emotion behind the information being said. Knowing how to communicate effectively can improve relationships one has at home, work and in social affairs. Understanding communication skills such as; listening, non-verbal communication and managing stress can help better the verbal communication and managing stress can help better the relationships one has with others.</p><p></p><p></p><p>(BODY)One of the main aspects in communicating is listening. An effective listener is one who, not only comprehends how the speaker feels but, also understands what they are stating. Building a strong connection between the speaker and the listener is one of the first steps to become a good listener. By building this connection speakers should first be in an environment with open minded listeners, it makes them feel more comfortable to state their opinions, feelings and ideas. Listeners should avoid being judgmental. The individual does not have to agree with the ideas, values or opinions of the speaker; however, to fully understand them, one must put aside their criticism. Speakers will believe that they can trust the listeners with their information when they know that they will not be judged. Miscommunication happens frequently, listene...</p><p></p><p>(CONCLUSION)tention to how people react to one another’s comments, guessing the relationship between the people and guessing how each feels about what is being said. This can inform individuals to better understand the use of body language when conversing with other people. It is also important to take into account individual differences. Different cultures use different non-verbal gestures. Frequently, when observing these gestures alone the observer can get the wrong impression, for instance, the listener can subconsciously cross their arms. This does not mean that they are bored or annoyed with the speaker; it can be a gesture that they are comfortable with. Viewing gestures as a whole will prevent these misunderstandings. Non-verbal gestures are not only physical, for example; the tone of voice addressing a child will be different from the way it is addressed to an adult.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>di ko na yan binilang kayo na bahala</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Modular learning is a form of distance learning that employs the use of self-learning modules. These self-learning modules are based on the most essential learning competencies (MELCS) provided by DepEd. </p><p></p><p>Ideally, the modules should include sections on motivation and assessment that serve as a complete guide for both the teacher's and students' desired competencies. The teachers will monitor the learner's progress through home visits (following social distancing protocols) and feedback mechanisms and guide those who need special attention Although this was what DepEd proposed and expected from teachers and students, this is far from the current realities involved in modular learning.</p><p></p><p>The realities of modular learning</p><p>The modular learning approach is hanging by a thread, and it's not the teachers' or the students' fault. The plan seems to be flawed from the start. With so many students, especially in public schools, it would be hard to give each one equal and undivided attention.

                        <p> </p><p></p><p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>:</p><p>Gender inequality refers to the unequal treatment or perception of individuals based on their gender. It affects both men and women, but it is a more prevalent issue for women. Gender inequality can manifest in a variety of ways, including in the workplace, in education, and in access to healthcare. Despite progress made in recent years, gender inequality remains a pervasive problem in many societies. In this essay, we will explore the ways in which gender inequality manifests, its causes and consequences, and the steps that can be taken to address it.</p><p></p><p><strong>BODY</strong>:</p><p>Gender inequality in the workplace is a major issue, with women often facing discrimination in terms of pay, promotion, and job opportunities. According to data from the World Economic Forum, the global gender pay gap stands at 16%, with women earning on average just 84% of what men earn. Women are also underrepresented in leadership positions, with only 24% of senior management roles held by women globally. This lack of representation at the top has a ripple effect, with fewer role models for women to look up to and fewer opportunities for women to advance in their careers.</p><p></p><p>Gender inequality in education is also a significant issue. In many countries, girls face barriers to accessing education, including poverty, cultural attitudes, and lack of infrastructure. This has a knock-on effect on their future opportunities and on their ability to contribute to their communities and societies. Globally, around 130 million girls are out of school, and girls are less likely than boys to complete secondary education.</p><p></p><p>Access to healthcare is also affected by gender inequality. Women are more likely to experience health problems than men, but they are less likely to have access to healthcare, and less likely to be able to afford it. This is particularly true in developing countries, where women are more likely to die from pregnancy and childbirth-related complications than in developed countries.</p><p></p><p>Gender inequality has many causes, including cultural attitudes, economic disparities, and a lack of political will to address the issue. However, there are also many steps that can be taken to address it. These include providing girls with access to education, implementing policies that promote gender equality in the workplace, and addressing the structural and cultural barriers that prevent women from accessing healthcare.</p><p></p><p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong>:</p><p>In conclusion, gender inequality is a pervasive problem that affects individuals and societies in many ways. It is essential that we take steps to address it, whether that be through providing girls with access to education, implementing policies that promote gender equality in the workplace, or addressing the structural and cultural barriers that prevent women from accessing healthcare. By working together and taking action, we can help create a more equal and just world for all. Gender inequality is a complex problem that cannot be solved overnight, but by working together, we can make progress and create a more equal society for all.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>As with any job, having and using the right tool makes all the difference. The work is easier and the results are much finer. It also prevents ruining your tools. A pair of pliers can be used to hammer a nail, but it makes the task much more difficult and risks damage to the pliers. The same is true of kitchen tools.</p><p></p><p>Yes, I can fry an egg in a one quart sauce pot, but it makes cooking and clean up much tougher than using a small frying pan. A slotted spoon can be used to spoon out a sauce, but it will take much longer and is guaranteed to make a mess.</p><p></p><p>And it is true that I have many kitchen tools and utensils that I don’t use very often. But when I need a peeler, I have a good one. I only use my baster a few times per year, but when I need it, it’s there. The same goes for all of my utensils and tools.</p><p></p><p>Doing woodwork, I don’t always need a level, a plane, or a nail punch, but I have those.</p><p></p><p>I recommend that you pay attention to how you cook and check online to see which tools are available to enhance your kitchen skills. Also, browse through the best kitchen supply stores in your area, and ask questions. A few years ago, I discovered the perfect egg timer in this way, and a small stone that magically keeps any boiling pot from boiling over. These are now indispensable to me.</p><p></p><p>Outside of the food quality and your skills, cooking tools and utensils are perhaps the most important part of any dish. although fine plating for presentation is important too.</p><br />
