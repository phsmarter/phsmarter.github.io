Traveling allows a person to experience a change of atmosphere that often reinvigorates their thinking. Simply traveling from a rural town to a large city can change a person’s perspective and renew their spirits. With a packed suitcase, travel medical insurance, and a plane ticket, a person is well on their way to a travel adventure full of fresh sights.</p><p></p><p>Another motivation to travel is the urge to learn about a different place and its customs. For example, an American traveling to Australia for the first time has a chance to experience an entirely new environment, learn new customs, and even hear the English language spoken with an unfamiliar accent. Traveling is an effective way for a person to gain firsthand knowledge about a place and its inhabitants. Visiting another country is also beneficial to those who want to learn more about its history or view its treasures of architecture.</p><p></p><p>Travel can sometimes be helpful in renewing a person’s spirits after they have experienced a great sadness in their life or a time of trial. Traveling faraway oceans on a cruise ship, exploring unfamiliar countryside, or even staying with friends in a different city can be a healing experience for someone who has just weathered a troubled time. In many instances, when the person returns from their trip they feel rested and better equipped to deal with everyday life.</p><br />

Question: Considering the same amount of temperature in each medium/material, in which of the following materials do sound waves travel the fastest- GOLD, AIR or FRESH WATER? Why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Sound is one form of energy that is produced by vibrations</strong>. These vibrations travel through different mediums such as gas, liquid, and solids. As it travels through the different mediums, the particles of the medium also move. This movement is referred to as sound waves. There are two <strong>factors that will affect the movement of sound, namely, temperature and medium.</strong> Given that the temperature is the same in different materials, the sound will travel at different speeds depending on the kind of material. <strong>Of the three kinds of materials (gas, liquid, solid), sound waves travel the slowest through gases, faster through liquids, and fastest through solids.</strong> The reason for this has something to do with the <strong>arrangement of particles</strong>. The <strong>particles of gas are farthest apart from each other</strong>, thus, are less likely to collide and transmit the vibrations or energy. On the other hand, it travels fastest in solids since <strong>particles of solids are closest to each other</strong> and therefore it allows transmission of vibrations (energy) fastest. Liquid particles are far from each other but not as far as gas and not as close as solid. It is intermediate between solid and gas. Thus, among gold, air, and freshwater, the <strong>sound will travel fastest in gold, followed by freshwater, then air. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

The word travelogue supposedly comes from a combination of the two words travel and monologue. ... So, descriptions of a traveler's inner world are not out-of-place in the travelogue.</p><p></p><p>Explanation;</p><p></p><p>In turn, the word monologue comes from the Greek words monos (alone) and logos (speech, word). A travelogue is then, in its most basic form, a spoken or written account of an individual’s experiences traveling, which usually appears in the past tense, in the first person, and with some verisimilitude.</p><p>Because a travelogue aims to be a true account of an individual’s experiences traveling, descriptions of what the traveler sees, hears, tastes, smells, and feels in the external world while traveling are essential components.</p><p>Of course, thoughts, feelings, and reflections are important parts of our experience of travel. So, descriptions of a traveler’s inner world are not out-of-place in the travelogue.</p><p>Likewise, notes and observations on history, society, and culture are also common features of travelogues, as we certainly learn about the world when we travel.</p><p>If you want to write a better travel stories, check out our tips to write better travelogues.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

How does sound travel in different materials?</p><p>3. What is reflection?</p><p>4. What is refraction?</p><p>5. How the refraction and reflection of light occur?</p><p></p><p>(ESSAY!)</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>﻿1. Heat is the transfer of energy from a warmer object to a cooler object. Heat can be transferred in three ways: by conduction, by convection, and by radiation. Conduction is the transfer of energy from one molecule to another by direct contact.</p><p>2. Sound travels more quickly through solids than through liquids and gases because the molecules of a solid are closer together and, therefore, can transmit the vibrations (energy) faster. Sound travels most slowly through gases because the molecules of a gas are farthest apart.</p><p>3. Reflection is the throwing back by a body or surface of light, heat, or sound without absorbing it.</p><p>4. Refraction is the fact or phenomenon of light, radio waves, etc. being deflected in passing obliquely through the interface between one medium and another or through a medium of varying density.</p><p>5.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The Cavite Mutiny and GOMBURZA<p></p><p>The mutiny was used by the colonial government and Spanish friars to implicate three secular priests, Mariano Gomez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora, collectively known as Gomburza. They were executed by garrote in Luneta, also known in Tagalog as Bagumbayan, on February 17, 1872. </p><p>The Cavite Mutiny is an aim of natives to get rid of the Spanish government in the Philippines, due to the removal of privileges enjoyed by the laborers of the Cavite armory such as exemption from the tribute and forced labor.</p><p></p><p>The following events brought forth the nationalistic spirits in different parts of Manila. Uprisings were everywhere, dissent moved underground, and revolution happened through pens and weapons. In my opinion, the execution of the three martyr priests showed how corrupt the Spanish regime is. This is also how the national hero, Jose Rizal, came to be.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/6444662</p><p></p><br />

It can clear out your mind from negativities and stress. Traveling alone is a great idea because you are free to go wherever you want and do whatever you would like to do. When you are alone, you don't have somebody to compromise with and no baggage to deal with. If you are alone, you can decide for yourself and you can take charge of your money well. One can even make friends while traveling especially if you chose to stay on an island and go resort or bar hopping. If your purpose is to find yourself and purpose, then being alone is  a perfect idea. You will have all the moment to yourself. You will be able to meditate and reflect on what's going with your life. Who knows, while doing it, you can find the answers and solutions to your problems or find the one that you've been looking for. </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>﻿1. Heat is the transfer of energy from a warmer object to a cooler object. Heat can be transferred in three ways: by conduction, by convection, and by radiation. Conduction is the transfer of energy from one molecule to another by direct contact.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Sound travels more quickly through solids than through liquids and gases because the molecules of a solid are closer together and, therefore, can transmit the vibrations (energy) faster. Sound travels most slowly through gases because the molecules of a gas are farthest apart.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Reflection is the throwing back by a body or surface of light, heat, or sound without absorbing it.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Refraction is the fact or phenomenon of light, radio waves, etc. being deflected in passing obliquely through the interface between one medium and another or through a medium of varying density.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. When light traveling through one material reaches a second material, some of the light will be reflected, and some of the light will enter the second material. Refraction happens because the speed of light is different in different materials (though always less than the speed of light in a vacuum)
