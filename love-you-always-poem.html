                                            When everything's darkness
And you feel so alone,
When the rain doesn't stop
And you can't make it home,
When it feels all is lost
And you just want to run,
It can't rain forever.
Just wait for the sun.
When family is pain,
When friends can't be found,
When you just want to scream
But you can't find the sound,
When it's all your fault,
And you feel like you're done,
Just wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
The storm always passes.
It won't last forever.
The rain always stops and gives way to good weather.
The brightest and warmest of days still to come.
Please wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
People who need you,
People who still love you
Can warm up your soul like the sunshine above you.
You're never alone,
No matter what's done.
Wait for the sun.
Just wait for the sun.
Dark clouds always pass.
I promise you, hun.
We're all waiting with you.
Just wait for the sun.

                                            Friendship is one of life's greatest treasures. Friends that are loyal are always there to make you laugh when you are down, they are not afraid to help you avoid mistakes and they look out for your best interest. This kind of friend can be hard to find, but they offer a friendship that will last a lifetime. Other friends may not be quite as loving. The pain caused by a friendship marred by betrayal is not easy to overcome. In fact, many poems find their inspiration from the joy brought about by a loving friendship or the pain caused by a failed friendship.Pricelessness Of A True FriendA true friend is a rare gem, and I'm blessed with one - the inspiration for this poem. If you also have that special friend, I hope this helps you celebrate him/her. You may hum the good old "My Mother" tune as you read. Hope you enjoy it.GIVE 1 EXAMPLE OF POEM ABOUT FRIENDSHIP​</a>

And you feel so alone,
When the rain doesn't stop
And you can't make it home,
When it feels all is lost
And you just want to run,
It can't rain forever.
Just wait for the sun.
When family is pain,
When friends can't be found,
When you just want to scream
But you can't find the sound,
When it's all your fault,
And you feel like you're done,
Just wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
The storm always passes.
It won't last forever.
The rain always stops and gives way to good weather.
The brightest and warmest of days still to come.
Please wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
People who need you,
People who still love you
Can warm up your soul like the sunshine above you.
You're never alone,
No matter what's done.
Wait for the sun.
Just wait for the sun.
Dark clouds always pass.
I promise you, hun.
We're all waiting with you.
Just wait for the sun.

The cabinets and cupboards or even the drawers, always keep the items fully covered; Wipe the dust and remove the grime, for these two are kitchen's crime. Use the dry rack never gets old, because storing wet is never good.Question:What were you thinking while reading the poem?50 words po kailanganpls help me, brainliest q pag tama​</a>

                                            Dagger (Patalim)
by Cirilo Baustista (translated by J.A. Del Prado)
Day by day
my wife and I try
the sharpness
of our dagger.
For instance
when my youngest child
is crying
and my beloved
does not move
I stab her back
and merrily
watch her
nurse the child
while she bleeds.
If the light bulb is burned out
in our kitchen
and I am busy
writing a poem,
she never stops
stabbing me on the nape
as long as the light is
not replaced.
Our fight is fair
a fault is a fault, no
cheating.
That’s why
by the day’s end
we count
the
wounds
and the seemingly ragged souls
will laugh
and punch each other.
We are always like this since
our love for each other
is more than enough.

                                            The key to have a healthy family is to love them, respect them, and supporting them. A healthy relationship between family means that they feel love from you, it creates a strong connection from the family. A healthy family doesn’t need to be perfect or rich or anything, the importance of it is that you have fun memories of them. The more closer to your family the more bonding that you made. Make sure to have time for your family so that you will have good relationship. Always respect your family even if it is a young or old. Communicate with your family everyday to express how are you feeling today, how is your day at work or school. It is important to communicate to them so that you will be open to them if you had problems or you just need to speak with 
this helps you to be honest with your family. Always support your family at all time especially in difficult times. Always share with your family to show your appreciation to them that you care about your family.

                            5. When everything's darkness
And you feel so alone,
When the rain doesn't stop
And you can't make it home,
When it feels all is lost
And you just want to run,
It can't rain forever.
Just wait for the sun.
When family is pain,
When friends can't be found,
When you just want to scream
But you can't find the sound,
When it's all your fault,
And you feel like you're done,
Just wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
The storm always passes.
It won't last forever.
The rain always stops and gives way to good weather.
The brightest and warmest of days still to come.
Please wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
People who need you,
People who still love you
Can warm up your soul like the sunshine above you.
You're never alone,
No matter what's done.
Wait for the sun.
Just wait for the sun.
Dark clouds always pass.
I promise you, hun.
We're all waiting with you.
Just wait for the sun.

                            10. Friendship is one of life's greatest treasures. Friends that are loyal are always there to make you laugh when you are down, they are not afraid to help you avoid mistakes and they look out for your best interest. This kind of friend can be hard to find, but they offer a friendship that will last a lifetime. Other friends may not be quite as loving. The pain caused by a friendship marred by betrayal is not easy to overcome. In fact, many poems find their inspiration from the joy brought about by a loving friendship or the pain caused by a failed friendship.Pricelessness Of A True FriendA true friend is a rare gem, and I'm blessed with one - the inspiration for this poem. If you also have that special friend, I hope this helps you celebrate him/her. You may hum the good old "My Mother" tune as you read.

And you can't make it home,
When it feels all is lost
And you just want to run,
It can't rain forever.
Just wait for the sun.
When family is pain,
When friends can't be found,
When you just want to scream
But you can't find the sound,
When it's all your fault,
And you feel like you're done,
Just wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
The storm always passes.
It won't last forever.
The rain always stops and gives way to good weather.
The brightest and warmest of days still to come.
Please wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
People who need you,
People who still love you
Can warm up your soul like the sunshine above you.
You're never alone,
No matter what's done.
Wait for the sun.
Just wait for the sun.
Dark clouds always pass.
I promise you, hun.
We're all waiting with you.
Just wait for the sun.

by Cirilo Baustista (translated by J.A. Del Prado)
Day by day
my wife and I try
the sharpness
of our dagger.
For instance
when my youngest child
is crying
and my beloved
does not move
I stab her back
and merrily
watch her
nurse the child
while she bleeds.
If the light bulb is burned out
in our kitchen
and I am busy
writing a poem,
she never stops
stabbing me on the nape
as long as the light is
not replaced.
Our fight is fair
a fault is a fault, no
cheating.
That’s why
by the day’s end
we count
the
wounds
and the seemingly ragged souls
will laugh
and punch each other.
We are always like this since
our love for each other
is more than enough.

It is proven by the use of the repetition of "giving" as in giving and providing in the poem, as well as <br />sharing both happiness and sadness".By saying that <strong>love is the greatest of all</strong>, the writer puts love into the highest place there is compared to other feelings.I would accompany my loved ones as much as possible through both happy moments and hardships, and to provide my consolation should they need it.<p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>the topic of analyzing a poem </strong>by referring to https://brainly.ph/question/251953</p><p>#SPJ5</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The poem is all about the moon.</p><p>2. The moon likes to play game.</p><p>3. The moon loves to reflect the sunlight.</p><p>4. The Moon doesn't emit (give off) light itself, the 'moonlight' we see is actually the Sun's light reflected off the lunar surface. So, as the Moon orbits the Earth, the Sun lights up different parts of it, making it seem as if the Moon is changing shape.</p><br />

A healthy relationship between family means that they feel love from you, it creates a strong connection from the family. A healthy family doesn’t need to be perfect or rich or anything, the importance of it is that you have fun memories of them. The more closer to your family the more bonding that you made. Make sure to have time for your family so that you will have good relationship. Always respect your family even if it is a young or old.
