The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

What is considered a social issue in one country or timeframe, maybe an absolutely mundane event in other. So every social issue research paper should start from explaining the cultural context where it happened.</p><p></p><p>If you want your research paper to be easily understandable, you may also take into consideration the cultural background of your audience (at least its majority). Will they understand the examples you provide or shall you add some more explanations just to make sure you are on the same page? Or, on the contrary, is your audience somehow connected to the social issue you want to study? If so, you should be especially careful with your research, so you won’t offend them or trigger some unwanted memories.</p><p></p><p>The diversity of social issues allows the researchers to choose the ones that weren’t studied before and apply the new approaches to those that were studied already. But to make your research paper really great you should carefully examine the previous researches regarding the social issue you want to study. Was there something you can use as a basis for your own research? Or do you see the “blind spot” you can fill with your paper, completing the picture?</p><p></p><p>Learn more: How to create a great research paper example for college?</p><p></p><p>The social issues research papers may seem easy to write in comparison with other topics, but they still demand a very creative approach, a huge amount of curiosity and ability to think outside the box and look for information in unconventional sources.</p><p></p><p>Useful information: Where can I pay someone to write my research paper?</p><p></p><p>NOTE: By clicking on the topics below you have an opportunity to get a custom written paper.

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Title: The Philippine Mythology</p><p></p><p>Summary: </p><p>   Philippine mythology is the body of stories and epics originating from, and part of, the indigenous Philippine folk religions, which include various ethnic faiths distinct from one another. Philippine mythology is incorporated from various sources, having similarities with Indonesian and Malay myths, as well as Hindu, Muslim, Shinto, Buddhist, and Christian traditions, such as the notion of heaven (kaluwalhatian, kalangitan, kamurawayan, etc.), hell (kasamaan, sulad, etc.), and the human soul (kaluluwa, kaulolan, makatu, ginokud, etc.). Philippine mythology attempts to explain the nature of the world through the lives and actions of heroes, deities (referred to as anito or diwata in some ethnic groups), and mythological creatures. The majority of these myths were passed on through oral tradition, and preserved through the aid of community spiritual leaders or shamans (babaylan, katalonan, mumbaki, baglan, machanitu, walian, mangubat, bahasa, etc.) and community elders.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Tayo ay pilipino/ may pa ninindigan </p><br />
