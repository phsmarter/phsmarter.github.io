                            3. similarities Nila Aristotle Socrates at plato​</h2><br />
                        <p>This is a very broad question, so I’ll attempt to respond with reference to their political thought, and more specifically with reference to their attitude to Athenian democracy.</p><p></p><p>First thing to remember is that Socrates, Plato's teacher, never wrote anything. What we know of him we largely get through the writings of Plato (primarily) and Xenophon. Although Socrates is the protagonist in the overwhelming majority of the Platonic corpus (Laws being an exception), only earlier dialogues (e.g. Euthyphro, Apology, Crito) are considered to offer a fairly accurate depiction of his thought. What I say about Socrates stems from these early works.</p><p></p><p>Socrates was famous for his desire to engage his fellow citizens in discussions over issues of public importance ranging from piety, to beauty and justice. His dialectic method required all beliefs and ideas to be thoroughly tested and scrutinised (elenchus). Through a series of, often simple, questions, Socrates was able to reveal contradictions and inconsistencies in deeply held popular beliefs—he was, in his own words, like a gadfly that doesn’t leave Athenians alone. As you can imagine his fellow citizens weren’t particularly fond of an old man walking around questioning every single idea, making them look foolish in the process. Yet Socrates was a proponent of Athenian democracy, not least because it was a regime that facilitated his ability to philosophise, i.e. his freedom to speak his mind (notwithstanding the fact that this got him killed in the end). Again, this is a rather crude portrayal of Socrates who, especially in Crito, reveals a much more nuanced attitude to Athenian democratic laws.</p><p></p><p>Athenian democracy’s failure, culminating in the jury’s decision to sentence Socrates, the greatest product of Athenian democracy, to death, was a turning point for his student Plato. He therefore produced a systemic repudiation of Athenian democracy, and democracy in general. Democracy, characterised by short-sightedness, haphazard and shifting majorities, emphasis on individualism, and even a form of interest-group pluralism, is unable to produce justice. Plato thus proposes a better regime, capable of achieving justice. In his Republic, political power must be wholly surrendered to an elite group of philosophically trained superior intellectuals. To ensure that these so-called philosopher-rulers escape corruption, in addition to a robust and everything-perfectly-regulated educational system, Plato institutes among them a form of radical communism; property and family are held in common (he offers detailed devices that will keep the scheme in operation). Of course, in later writings Plato offers subtler versions of the ideal type society but the main idea remains—it is not democratic.</p><p></p><p>Aristotle, Plato’s student, rejected his attempt at searching for an ideal state. He instead undertakes an intense analysis of actual political systems. Democracy, although not the absolutely corrupt form of government Plato describes, still suffers from severe shortcomings. For Aristotle, the best possible regime will be a mixture of the good forms of government (monarchy-rule of one, aristocracy-rule of the few best, and democracy-rule of the many). His republic will be able to produce good laws and good citizens. To achieve this, Aristotle proposes that citizens must rule and be ruled in turn. This rotationary system of government ensures that everyong gets a turn in rule. (When I say everyone I mean, of course, only male Athenian born heads of household—no place for slaves, women or metic (foreigners) in public discourse, Incidentally, Plato allowed for women to ascend to the ranks of philosopher-rulers).</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Socrates, Plato and Aristotle are the three best-known Greek philosophers of antiquity, representing the classical era of Greek philosophy. In succession, Socrates taught Plato, and Plato taught Aristotle. Each man formulated his own rhetorical argument style and hypotheses about the nature of knowledge to influence the next generation of thinking people. These incredibly important philosophers formed the backbone of higher education for hundreds of years, and their influences continue to this day in the field of philosophy.</p><br />

                        The main difference between Plato and Aristotle philosophy is that the philosophy of Plato is more theoretical and abstract in nature, whereas the philosophy of Aristotle is more practical and experimental in nature. Plato <br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Plato (c.428 - 347 BC) and Aristotle (384 - 322 BC) are two of the most influential philosophers in history. Socrates was also seen as a great philosopher and, as his pupil, Plato was greatly influenced by his teachings. Plato then became the teacher of Aristotle who, although a long-term pupil, was able to find many faults in Plato’s theories and in fact became a great critic of his teacher. Despite his criticisms though, Aristotle was influenced by Plato, making their works, which target the same aspects of philosophy, easily comparable.</p><br />

Both Aristotle and Galileo believed that the velocity of a body increases as it falls.</p><p></p><p>5. Both Aristotle and Galileo believed that the speed of a body decreases as the resistance of the medium increases</p>Both Aristotle and Galileo were interested in the motion of objects, particularly in relation to vertical motion. Both philosophers believed that objects in motion would fall to the ground unless acted upon by an external force. They also both recognized that the speed at which an object falls is determined by its weight and the resistance of the air through which it is moving. In addition, both Aristotle and Galileo believed that the motion of an object could be described mathematically, and they both made significant contributions to the study of motion and its underlying principles.__________________________<p><strong>Have </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>great </strong><strong>day</strong><strong>!</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            14. what is the difference between Socratic, Plato and Aristotle about the nature of man?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ancient Greek philosophy arose in the 6th century BC and lasted through the Hellenistic period (323 BC-30 BC). Greek philosophy covers an absolutely enormous amount of topics including: political philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, ontology (the study of the nature of being, becoming, existence, or reality), logic, biology, rhetoric, and aesthetics (branch of philosophy dealing with art, beauty, and taste). Greek philosophy is known for its undeniable influence on Western thought. Although there were Greek philosophers before their respective births, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are the only three worth focusing on during this period.</p><p></p><p>Socrates, born in Athens in 470 BC, is often credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy. The cloud of mystery surrounding his life and philosophical viewpoints propose a problem; a problem so large that it’s given a name itself: The Socratic Problem. Since he did not write philosophical texts, all knowledge related to him is entirely dependent on the writings of other people of the time period. Works by Plato, Xenophon, Aristotle, and Aristophanes contain all of the knowledge known about this enigmatic figure. His largest contribution to philosophy is the Socratic method. The Socratic method is defined as a form of inquiry and discussion between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to illuminate ideas. This method is performed by asking question after question with the purpose of seeking to expose contradictions in one’s thoughts, guiding him/her to arrive at a solid, tenable conclusion. The principle underlying the Socratic Method is that humans learn through the use of reasoning and logic; ultimately finding holes in their own theories and then patching them up.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Plato, student of Socrates, also has mystery surrounding him. His birth day is estimated to fall between 428 BC and 423 BC. He’s known for being the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. My favorite of Plato’s contributions to philosophy, and the one I’m going to focus on, is the Theory of Forms. This theory was created to solve two problems, one of ethics and one of permanence and change. The ethical problem is: how can humans live a fulfilling life in an ever changing world if everything that they hold close to them can be easily taken away? The problem dealing with permanence and change is: How can the world appear to be both permanent and changing? The world we perceive through senses seems to be always changing–which is a pretty clear observation. The world that we perceive through the mind, seems to be permanent and unchanging. Which world perceived is more real? Why are we seen two different worlds?</p><p></p><p>To find a solution to these problems, Plato split the world into two: the material, or phyiscal, realm and the transcendent, or mental, realm of forms. We have access to the realm of forms through the mind, allowing us access to an unchanging world. This particular world is invulnerable to the pains and changes of the material world. By detaching our souls from the material world and our bodies and developing our ability to concern ourselves with the forms, Plato believes this will lead to us finding a value which is not open to change. This solves the ethical problem. Splitting existence up into two realms also leads us to a solution to the problem of permanence and change. Our mind perceives a different world, with different objects, than our senses do. It is the material world, perceived through the senses, that is changing. It is the realm of forms, perceived through the mind, that is permanent.</p><p></p><p>Aristotle, student of Plato, lived from 384 BC-322 BC. At eighteen, he joined Plato’s Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven. There, he honed his talents of understanding the world. In his understanding of the world, he wrote his theory of the universals–which I find to be extremely intriguing. The problem of the universals is the question of whether properties exist, and if so, what exactly are they. To avoid confusion, a universal is a metaphysical term describing what particular things have in common, focusing strictly characteristics or qualities. His theory states that universals exist only where they are instantiated (the concept that it is impossible for a property to exist which is not had by some object). In simpler terms, he believes universals exist only in things, never apart from things–differing from his teacher, Plato, on this. Aristotle believes that a universal is identical in each of its instances. All round things are similar in that there is the same universal, characteristic, throughout.</p><p></p><p>These three laid the foundations of many of the believes of the rest of the Western world. Philosophers such as John Locker and Descartes use the theories these brilliant minds brought forth in their own works. I’m very interested to read your opinions, specifically on the Plato theory.</p><br />
