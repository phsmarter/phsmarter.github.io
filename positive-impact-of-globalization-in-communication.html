                                            Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

It is such a critical issue that world leaders have met to try and find a workable solution. Unfortunately, no agreement was reached I because everyone had a different point of view. Some people think that nothing we do can change I what is happening, that it is completely natural. On the other hand, others argue strongly that the human impact on the climate over the last hundred years, and the increasing levels of carbon dioxide I into the atmosphere, have had a devastating impact on our environment. Who is right?First, it is important to understand that our climate has always been changing Even today climate change is one of the possible explanations for the extinction of the dinosaurs, millions of years I ago. Likewise, the end of the ice age in prehistoric times was also due to the warming of Earth's l climate. Both of these significant events occurred well before any human Intervention. Others in the scientific community believe that the movement and reactions in the Sun influence our own climate more than we previously realized Solar flares leap out from the Sun and send great bursts of heat I and radiation towards the Earth, causing some changes to our atmosphere. Volcanic eruptions too. I other pollutantsover which ople have absolutely no control, also send huge amounts of gas and also cause changes in regional climates, Human beings areinto the atmosphere. These events I certainly not the only ones who impact upon our environment.​</a>

                            17. Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

Who is right?First, it is important to understand that our climate has always been changing Even today climate change is one of the possible explanations for the extinction of the dinosaurs, millions of years I ago. Likewise, the end of the ice age in prehistoric times was also due to the warming of Earth's l climate. Both of these significant events occurred well before any human Intervention. Others in the scientific community believe that the movement and reactions in the Sun influence our own climate more than we previously realized Solar flares leap out from the Sun and send great bursts of heat I and radiation towards the Earth, causing some changes to our atmosphere.

                        <p><strong>Answer and Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. The impact of globalization is complex and can have both positive and negative effects, depending on the perspective that you choose. Globalization also poses social challenges like creating a standardized language, which can enhance communications but also put pressure on people who speak different languages.</p><p><br />On one hand, globalization has a positive impact because it creates connections between cultures that may be geographically, economically or politically isolated from each other. For example: It gives more opportunities for trade and commerce (exporting goods internationally) which can result in more jobs at home.</p><p></p><p>2. There is no denying the immense progress made in humanity over the past few centuries. However, as we continue to share information and grow into one global conglomerate of people, some argue that technology has done more harm than good. There are those who believe that this expanding field of digital media has helped unite humanity, while others claim that it's created a divide between individuals.</p><br />

                            27. What is the impact of Globalization on how people communicate? Mention some positive and negative impacts.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>POSITIVE IMPACTS OF GLOBALIZATION </p><p>1. Gives Access to a Larger Market</p><p>Through globalization countries and companies have access to a bigger consumer base. Instead of only selling products in their country a business can expand to other regions boosting sales and in the process making more money.</p><p>2. Provides Cheaper Goods for Consumers</p><p>Because of globalization a lot of companies are moving to areas where their cost of production is low they, in turn, offer cheaper products because they are not expensive to make hence lower prices for consumers.</p><p>3. Globalization Wets Countries do what They do Best</p><p>For example, a country can buy cheap steel from another country instead of making its own steel. They can then focus their efforts on making other things they are good at like computers and export them to the countries they import cheap steal from.</p><p>4.Better Quality and Variety</p><p>Competition from different countries drives firms to improve their products. Consumers have better quality products and more variety as a result.</p><p></p><p>NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF GLOBALIZATION</p><p>1. Causes Environmental Damage</p><p>Globalization has led to increased production for businesses in order to meet global demand. Increased production means more natural resources are used and this can be used up before they are regenerated leading to a negative impact on the environment</p><p>2.Job Insecurity</p><p>Globalization provides a double-edged sword when it comes to jobs. It creates jobs for people in developing countries who provide cheaper manufacturing jobs</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>-hope it helps [: </p><p>sorry if not.</p><br />
