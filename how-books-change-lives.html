                                            I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call "the danger of the single story." I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to the truth. So, I was an early reader. And what I read were British and American children's books. I was also an early writer. And when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading. All my characters were white and blue-eyed. They played in the snow. They ate apples. (Laughter) And they talked a lot about the weather, how lovely it was that the sun had come out. (Laughter) Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We didn't have snow. We ate mangoes. And we never talked about the weather because there was no need to. My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was. (Laughter) And for many years afterwards, I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer. But that is another story. What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story, particularly as children. Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books, by their very nature, had to have foreigners in them, and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify. Now, things changed when I discovered African books. There weren't many of them available. And they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books. But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature. I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature. I started to write about things I recognized. Now, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature. So, what the discovery of African writers did for me was this: It saved me from having a single story of what books are Excerpt from TED Talk, The Danger of a Single Story, by Chimamanda Adichiewhat's the answer ​</a>

                                            Imagine you were born in 1830. Throughout your life, you witness one momentous change after another. By the first decade of the twentieth century, the world around you has been transformed thoroughly. Now comes an important event in your life. It may not make it into the history books or the newspapers, but it’s all your family members can talk about…the birth of your first great granddaughter in 1914! You’ve lived through a lot of changes, and you begin to wonder about how the world might be transformed during her lifetime. After all, your granddaughter might well live until the year 2000! You sit down to write a letter to your newborn granddaughter—something she can read in the years and decades ahead. Reflecting on the types of changes that have taken place in your lifetime, you decide to write about what you think will happen in the century ahead. Your letter will address possible changes in the four categories you looked at in the previous activity: political/military, cultural, science/technology, and social/economic. In addition, you’ll want to write about these key points:
(a) Ways in which life might improve in the future. 
(b) Good things from the previous century that might be lost as times change.
(c) How your granddaughter should view change, what she should resist and what she should embrace.

Identify what kind of adverb was used. Gruwell will be the Olin Fellows speaker for the Assembly Series at 4 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 3, in Anheuser-Busch Hall Moot Courtroom, Room 310. Her talk, “Becoming a Catalyst for Change,” is free and open to the public. When Gruwell walked into class on her first day as an English teacher, she was met by a room full of angry, frustrated teenagers who were determined to hate everything about her, the school, even themselves. She didn’t know how to break through the invisible barrier that kept her students from learning. What she did know is that everyone in the school had written off these teens. After learning about the hardships in these teens’ lives — an environment full of racism, rejection and the tragedy of seeing no hope for the future — she understood why they saw no point in reading and writing. Gruwell also understood their need for self-expression, so her students began writing anonymous journal entries about their lives. After seeing a film about the Freedom Riders, a group of teenagers who showed remarkable bravery during the Civil Rights Movement, the class decided to call themselves the Freedom Writers. In 1999, their entries became a best-selling book called The Freedom Writers Diary: How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them. In 2007, Hilary Swank played Gruwell in the Freedom Writers film. Today, Gruwell runs The Freedom Writers Foundation, which she started in 1997.

                                            Dear Ash
Ash —
I’m worried to death because I haven’t been able to see you doing well.
You said we live in different worlds. But is that true?
We have different colored skin and eyes. We were born in different countries.
But we’re friends. Isn’t that what counts?
I’m really glad I came to America. I met lots of people.
And more than anything, I met you.
You asked me over and over if you scared me. But I never feared you, not once.
What’s more is you’re hurt much more than me. I couldn’t help feeling that way.
Funny, huh?
You’re way smarter, bigger, and stronger than me. But I always felt like I had to protect you. I wonder what it is I wanted to protect you from.
I wanted to protect you from fate.
The fate that tries to carry you away, drifting futher and futher.
You told me once about a leopard you read in a book. How you believed that leopard knew that it couldn’t go back.
And I said you weren’t a leopard, that you could change your destiny.
You’re not alone. I’m by your side.
My soul is always with you.

Compare and contrast through a Venn diagram the words teacher and computer based from the given text. Title : COMPUTER'S (TECHNOLOGY) AND TEACHER'SIn schools, colleges, or universities, the teacher acts as the mentors to the students when they face any issues. After the college hours, if they encounter any problem, then the student has to wait for the next day. But the days are changing day-by-day; the students with the use of technology get the answers to their questions. When you want to learn a new language, then you have to attend the language training academy. Now, the users are getting the training classes at the fingertips by watching it on their mobiles or any other gadgets. Moreover, the teachers may be expert in a few subjects, but you can get everything with the technology and turn into an expert. If you have any doubt, you have to go and meet the concerned teacher to clarify your doubt. Now, the users are getting the training classes at the fingertips by watching it on their mobiles or any other gadgets. Moreover, the teachers may be expert in a few subjects, but you can get everything with the technology and turn into an expert. If you have any doubt, you have to go and meet the concerned teacher to clarify your doubt. But with the computers, by sitting in one location, you can get all answers to the questions. A library consists of almost 1 Lakh books, but there are huge collections of e-books in the internet world. When compared the teachers with the computers, the technology will not teach the ethics, way of life, or moral values but the teacher along with the subject can teach how to live with the moral values, ethics &amp; integrity, and the responsibilities. The technology can’t replace the teachers because the teacher itself says how to use the technology in a right way. The best example of this is, the calculator cannot replace the mathematics teacher. A teacher can grasp the interest of the students but the computer cannot find out the interesting subjects of the students. Some of the students can’t afford the fees for their studies; in this case, the technology will help in preparing their studies.​</a>

The codex was more durable and compact than a scroll as it was made with parchment paper and bound with wooden covers. Information is important and books had been a necessity for everyone. The need for books resulted to the discovery of printed books. The first recorded printed book in history is the Diamond Sutra of Mahayana Buddhism. Books in schools are all product of printing.

First, success has always meant providing their family with a decent standard of living.

To an American, it is clear that success is the result of hard work and self-reliance. HOW Success for the Vietnamese For many people, the idea of success varies greatly.

                                            3. Imagine you were born in 1830. Throughout your life, you witness one momentous change after another. By the first decade of the twentieth century, the world around you has been transformed thoroughly. Now comes an important event in your life. It may not make it into the history books or the newspapers, but it’s all your family members can talk about…the birth of your first great granddaughter in 1914! You’ve lived through a lot of changes, and you begin to wonder about how the world might be transformed during her lifetime. After all, your granddaughter might well live until the year 2000! You sit down to write a letter to your newborn granddaughter—something she can read in the years and decades ahead. Reflecting on the types of changes that have taken place in your lifetime, you decide to write about what you think will happen in the century ahead. Your letter will address possible changes in the four categories you looked at in the previous activity: political/military, cultural, science/technology, and social/economic. In addition, you’ll want to write about these key points:
(a) Ways in which life might improve in the future. 
(b) Good things from the previous century that might be lost as times change.
(c) How your granddaughter should view change, what she should resist and what she should embrace.</a>

Lily's parents had moved away for work, and she couldn't go with them because of school. She was a brave girl, but she felt lonely and scared living on her own. Lily's days were filled with schoolwork, and she would spend her evenings reading books or watching movies. However, her life was about to change when she met a new friend. One day, while walking home from school, Lily found a small, injured bird lying on the ground. She quickly took it home and nursed it back to health. She named the bird Pip, and he became her constant companion. Lily and Pip had many adventures together in the city. They would explore the streets, visit the park, and even attend local festivals. Lily was no longer scared and lonely with Pip by her side. However, their happiness was threatened when Lily received a notice that her apartment building was going to be demolished. Lily didn't want to leave her home, and she was worried about what would happen to Pip. Lily had to use all her courage and resourcefulness to save her home and her friend. With the help of her schoolmates, Lily organized a petition and rallied the community to stop the demolition. Will Lily be able to save her home and her friend? Will she be able to overcome her fears and find happiness?

                            6. I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call "the danger of the single story." I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to the truth. So, I was an early reader. And what I read were British and American children's books. I was also an early writer. And when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading. All my characters were white and blue-eyed. They played in the snow. They ate apples. (Laughter) And they talked a lot about the weather, how lovely it was that the sun had come out. (Laughter) Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We didn't have snow. We ate mangoes. And we never talked about the weather because there was no need to. My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was. (Laughter) And for many years afterwards, I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer. But that is another story. What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story, particularly as children. Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books, by their very nature, had to have foreigners in them, and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify. Now, things changed when I discovered African books. There weren't many of them available. And they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books. But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature. I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature. I started to write about things I recognized. Now, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature. So, what the discovery of African writers did for me was this: It saved me from having a single story of what books are Excerpt from TED Talk, The Danger of a Single Story, by Chimamanda Adichiewhat's the answer ​</h2><br />

                            7. Imagine you were born in 1830. Throughout your life, you witness one momentous change after another. By the first decade of the twentieth century, the world around you has been transformed thoroughly. Now comes an important event in your life. It may not make it into the history books or the newspapers, but it’s all your family members can talk about…the birth of your first great granddaughter in 1914! You’ve lived through a lot of changes, and you begin to wonder about how the world might be transformed during her lifetime. After all, your granddaughter might well live until the year 2000! You sit down to write a letter to your newborn granddaughter—something she can read in the years and decades ahead. Reflecting on the types of changes that have taken place in your lifetime, you decide to write about what you think will happen in the century ahead. Your letter will address possible changes in the four categories you looked at in the previous activity: political/military, cultural, science/technology, and social/economic. In addition, you’ll want to write about these key points:
(a) Ways in which life might improve in the future. 
(b) Good things from the previous century that might be lost as times change.
(c) How your granddaughter should view change, what she should resist and what she should embrace.

                            8. Read the article entitled "Erin Gruwell explains the power of storytelling to transform lives and have a careful examination of adverbs used in the article. Identify what kind of adverb was used. Gruwell will be the Olin Fellows speaker for the Assembly Series at 4 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 3, in Anheuser-Busch Hall Moot Courtroom, Room 310. Her talk, “Becoming a Catalyst for Change,” is free and open to the public. When Gruwell walked into class on her first day as an English teacher, she was met by a room full of angry, frustrated teenagers who were determined to hate everything about her, the school, even themselves. She didn’t know how to break through the invisible barrier that kept her students from learning. What she did know is that everyone in the school had written off these teens. After learning about the hardships in these teens’ lives — an environment full of racism, rejection and the tragedy of seeing no hope for the future — she understood why they saw no point in reading and writing. Gruwell also understood their need for self-expression, so her students began writing anonymous journal entries about their lives. After seeing a film about the Freedom Riders, a group of teenagers who showed remarkable bravery during the Civil Rights Movement, the class decided to call themselves the Freedom Writers. In 1999, their entries became a best-selling book called The Freedom Writers Diary: How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them. In 2007, Hilary Swank played Gruwell in the Freedom Writers film. Today, Gruwell runs The Freedom Writers Foundation, which she started in 1997. The foundation trains educators to use innovative techniques to change the world, one class at a time. Gruwell earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of California, Irvine, and a master’s degree and teaching credentials from California State University, Long Beach Yan po ung nasa article pakisagotan nmn po plss.. bbigyan kopo ng 50 points ung tamng sagot tpos ibbrainliest kopo..​</h2><br />

Ash —
I’m worried to death because I haven’t been able to see you doing well.
You said we live in different worlds. But is that true?
We have different colored skin and eyes. We were born in different countries.
But we’re friends. Isn’t that what counts?
I’m really glad I came to America. I met lots of people.
And more than anything, I met you.
You asked me over and over if you scared me. But I never feared you, not once.
What’s more is you’re hurt much more than me. I couldn’t help feeling that way.
Funny, huh?
You’re way smarter, bigger, and stronger than me. But I always felt like I had to protect you. I wonder what it is I wanted to protect you from.
I wanted to protect you from fate.
The fate that tries to carry you away, drifting futher and futher.
You told me once about a leopard you read in a book. How you believed that leopard knew that it couldn’t go back.
And I said you weren’t a leopard, that you could change your destiny.
You’re not alone. I’m by your side.
My soul is always with you.

Compare and contrast through a Venn diagram the words teacher and computer based from the given text. Title : COMPUTER'S (TECHNOLOGY) AND TEACHER'SIn schools, colleges, or universities, the teacher acts as the mentors to the students when they face any issues. After the college hours, if they encounter any problem, then the student has to wait for the next day. But the days are changing day-by-day; the students with the use of technology get the answers to their questions. When you want to learn a new language, then you have to attend the language training academy. Now, the users are getting the training classes at the fingertips by watching it on their mobiles or any other gadgets. Moreover, the teachers may be expert in a few subjects, but you can get everything with the technology and turn into an expert. If you have any doubt, you have to go and meet the concerned teacher to clarify your doubt. Now, the users are getting the training classes at the fingertips by watching it on their mobiles or any other gadgets. Moreover, the teachers may be expert in a few subjects, but you can get everything with the technology and turn into an expert. If you have any doubt, you have to go and meet the concerned teacher to clarify your doubt. But with the computers, by sitting in one location, you can get all answers to the questions. A library consists of almost 1 Lakh books, but there are huge collections of e-books in the internet world. When compared the teachers with the computers, the technology will not teach the ethics, way of life, or moral values but the teacher along with the subject can teach how to live with the moral values, ethics &amp; integrity, and the responsibilities. The technology can’t replace the teachers because the teacher itself says how to use the technology in a right way. The best example of this is, the calculator cannot replace the mathematics teacher.

                            28. 3. Imagine you were born in 1830. Throughout your life, you witness one momentous change after another. By the first decade of the twentieth century, the world around you has been transformed thoroughly. Now comes an important event in your life. It may not make it into the history books or the newspapers, but it’s all your family members can talk about…the birth of your first great granddaughter in 1914! You’ve lived through a lot of changes, and you begin to wonder about how the world might be transformed during her lifetime. After all, your granddaughter might well live until the year 2000! You sit down to write a letter to your newborn granddaughter—something she can read in the years and decades ahead. Reflecting on the types of changes that have taken place in your lifetime, you decide to write about what you think will happen in the century ahead. Your letter will address possible changes in the four categories you looked at in the previous activity: political/military, cultural, science/technology, and social/economic. In addition, you’ll want to write about these key points:
(a) Ways in which life might improve in the future. 
(b) Good things from the previous century that might be lost as times change.
(c) How your granddaughter should view change, what she should resist and what she should embrace.</h2><br />

                            29. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who lived alone in a small apartment in the middle of a bustling city. Lily's parents had moved away for work, and she couldn't go with them because of school. She was a brave girl, but she felt lonely and scared living on her own. Lily's days were filled with schoolwork, and she would spend her evenings reading books or watching movies. However, her life was about to change when she met a new friend. One day, while walking home from school, Lily found a small, injured bird lying on the ground. She quickly took it home and nursed it back to health. She named the bird Pip, and he became her constant companion. Lily and Pip had many adventures together in the city. They would explore the streets, visit the park, and even attend local festivals. Lily was no longer scared and lonely with Pip by her side. However, their happiness was threatened when Lily received a notice that her apartment building was going to be demolished. Lily didn't want to leave her home, and she was worried about what would happen to Pip. Lily had to use all her courage and resourcefulness to save her home and her friend. With the help of her schoolmates, Lily organized a petition and rallied the community to stop the demolition. Will Lily be able to save her home and her friend? Will she be able to overcome her fears and find happiness? Question:1.Why did lily have to live alone in the city?2.Why did lily do to take care of the injured bird?3.What kind of adventures did Lily and Pip have together?4.Why was Lily's home going to be demolished?5.How did Lily save her home and her friend?Activity:Base in the story you already readwhat title could it be?who is the characters in the story?what was the setting of the story?what is the conflict of the story?what is the theme of the story?​</h2><br />
