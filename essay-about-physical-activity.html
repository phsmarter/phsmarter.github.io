                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Introduction</p><p></p><p>Physical activity is an important determinant of health. Its fundamental role in energy balance and weight control and in decreasing the risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, and depression is widely known. But in this fast paced life, people hardly incorporate physical activity in their daily routine. Non communicable diseases have, as a result been on the rise across the world.</p><p>Even Mauritius have not been spared from this growing concern on diseases. Undeniably, compared to the past, the health of Mauritians has bettered given that now more facilities are available to combat once mortal diseases. Lifespan has increased as a result and the trend is there are more people as from 65 years old with the balance tipping in favour of the female population. The main problem that Mauritius faces nowadays is in terms of non communicable diseases. The new life trend now leads to other complications like diabetes, hypertension, kidney failure, heart problems, smoke and alcohol related problems.</p><p></p><p>Examples of Aerobic Activities</p><p></p><p>Below are examples of aerobic activities. Depending on your level of fitness, they can be light, moderate, or vigorous in intensity:</p><p></p><p>Gardening, such as digging or hoeing that causes your heart rate to go up</p><p>Walking, hiking, jogging, and running</p><p>Water aerobics or swimming laps</p><p>Biking, skateboarding, rollerblading, and jumping rope</p><p>Ballroom dancing and aerobic dancing</p><p>Tennis, soccer, hockey, and basketball</p><p>In the present era, many technological advances and conveniences have made our life easier and less active. But there are other factors that affect participation in physical exercise. For instance, transportation, social capital, and time barriers independently contribute to low levels of physical activity. (Zlot et al., 2006). Physical activity is highly recommended among adults and those aged 18–64 years old should do at least 150 minutes of moderately intense physical activity throughout the week or at least 75 minutes of vigorous- activity throughout the week or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous activity.(WHO,2013).</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, according to the Mauritius non-communicable diseases survey 2009, only 16.5% of Mauritians (10.9% of women and 23.2%of men) undertook sufficient vigorous or moderate physical activity to meet national guidelines, that is, 150 minutes of activity per week. 56% (65.8% of women and 45.7% of men) reported doing no moderate or vigorous leisure time physical activity at all.</p><p></p><p>In line with the NCD survey 2009, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes aged 20-74 years was 21.3%: 21.9% in men and 20.6% in women in Mauritius. The prevalence of hypertension was 37.9%: 35.4% for women and 40.5% for men. The age and gender standardised prevalence of obesity was 16.0%: 11.3% in men and 20.5% in women (Mauritian adult population aged 25 -74 years). Comparing those results with the NCD 2004, the preliminary results of the 2004 NCD Survey indicate that the age-standardised prevalence of diabetes in the Mauritian population aged 20-74 years was 15.0% (15.0% among male, 15.1% among female). The prevalence of hypertension in 2004 in participants aged 20-74 years (standardized on the Census year 2000 population) was 24.2% in males, 22.8% in females and 23.1% in both sexes. In 2004, the age-standardised prevalence of obesity in adults aged 20-74 years was 5.6% among males and 13.7% among females, giving an overall prevalence of 10.3%.</p><p></p><p>On one side, adults do not perform enough physical activity, on the other side, type 2 diabetes; hypertension and obesity are on the rise in Mauritius.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>The benefits of physical activity and exercise have been demonstrated across the lifespan. We are meant to move and many of our body’s systems work better when we are consistently physically active.</p><p></p><p>For managing symptoms of depression, some research suggests that elevated levels of aerobic activity (exercise that significantly raises our heart rates) may be associated with greater reductions in depressive symptoms. Consider engaging in physical activity once or twice daily that includes brief periods (30-90 seconds) of greater intensity. For some, this might be accomplished through exercise in their homes including jumping jacks, mountain climbers, and sequencing strength training exercises (i.e. standing squats, push-ups, sit-ups). For others, the use of home exercise equipment such as treadmills, elliptical machines, and stationary bikes may be helpful.</p><p></p><p>Strength-training has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety for individuals with and without an anxiety disorder. Weightlifting using exercise equipment or household items (textbooks, canned goods, milk jugs filled with water, paint cans) may help us to reduce the negative effects of stress and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>For children and adolescents, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and exercise during the day are associated with elevations in self-esteem, improved concentration, reductions in depressive symptoms, and improvements in sleep.</p><p></p><p>For older adults and among individuals managing chronic medical conditions, regular walks are recommended. The benefits of strength training and weightlifting (low weight with high numbers of repetitions) may be even greater in older adults to maintain quality of life and functioning.</p><p></p><p>Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (such as speed-walking or jogging) has been shown to help reduce the use of alcohol and other substances. Additionally, participation in regular physical activity is shown to boost the immune system. Reduction in substance use is also associated with improvement in the body’s ability to fight off infection.</p><p></p><p>Many companies are offering free use of their on-line platforms that may help to identify a variety of in-home activities (indoor cycling, treadmill running, dance cardio, yoga, strength training, and more) to help make exercise more enjoyable during this critical period. We strongly support the idea of ongoing vigilance regarding physical-distancing and limitations on in-person contacts as guided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(link is external).</p><p></p><p>We recommend finding physical activities that you enjoy and to share your experience with others. At the same time, there is also evidence to suggest that exercise can be helpful to mood even if the act of doing the exercise is not as enjoyable.</p><p></p><p>It is important for family members to take a supportive role in the promotion of physical activity and exercise. Allowing individuals to maintain their autonomy and choice in their activities will be important for ongoing engagement.</p><p></p><p>We are all managing additional stress related to the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential to threaten the health of ourselves, our families, and our communities. Please consider using physical activity and exercise as a strategy to maintain health during this stressful period.</p><p></p><p>Although many things feel beyond our control right now, we do have the ability to be creative and to build physical activity and exercise into each of our days. We may even look back on this difficult time as the turning point when we learned new ways to build our emotional resilience and our physical health.</p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />
