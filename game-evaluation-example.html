                                            what is the main idea below.
- Many learners and teachers have established a wide range of
activities to support approaches to creativity and exploit the features of digital
technologies in processes such as: (a)developing ideas: supporting imaginative
conjecture, exploration and representation of ideas; (b) making connections:
supporting, challenging, informing and developing ideas by making
connections within formation, people, projects and resources; (c) creating and
making: engaging in making meanings though fashioning processes of
capture, manipulation and transformation of media; (d) collaboration:
working with others in immediate and dynamic ways to collaborate on
outcomes and construct shared knowledge; (e) communication and
evaluation: publishing and communicating outcomes for evaluation and
critique from a range of audiences. These activities are not always discrete or
sequential and there can be synchronicity in their expression and overlap of
applications for different purposes. Examples of such activities range from
using simulations and adventure games to explore the question ‘what would
happen if…?’, to publishing hypertext stories or constructing avatars to meet
and interact in three-dimensional, virtual worlds. This wealth of activity
illustrates how children and young people are able to use ICT to demonstrate
creative characteristics in the interaction between people and processes in
subject areas which are authentic, relevant and challenging</a>

b. When two billiard balls collide, momentum is lost.
c. In an American football game, a defensive player may decrease the momentum of a running offensive player with the ball.
d. In a badminton game, a smash decreases the momentum of the moving shuttlecock.
2. A moving family vehicle crashes into a fence and stops at 0.05 s. There is a 20 kg child in the car. Assume that the child's velocity is changed by the same amount as the vehicle in the same time period. What will happen to the momentum of the vehicle after the collision?
a. It is conserved.
b. It becomes zero.
c. It decreases
d. It increases
3. Evaluate which among the scenarios depicts the relationship of momentum and impulse to collision.
a. Billiard ball A collides with billiard ball B, resulting in a change in momentum.
b. Egg being dropped from a height resulting in a decrease in momentum.
c. Mud ball A collides with Mud ball B without incurring any deformations.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Answer: b. When two billiard balls collide, momentum is lost.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Answer: c. It decreases</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Answer: d. Billiard ball A collides with bowling ball B, resulting in a change in momentum.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>PLS </strong><strong>BRAINLIEST </strong><strong>ME!</strong><strong> </strong><strong>:</strong><strong>(</strong></p>1. The correct answer is d. In a badminton game, a smash decreases the momentum of the moving shuttlecock. In a collision, momentum is conserved, meaning that the total momentum before the collision is the same as the total momentum after the collision. However, the momentum of each object involved in the collision may change. In the case of a badminton smash, the momentum of the shuttlecock is decreased by the racket, resulting in a change in its direction and speed.<br /><br />2. The correct answer is a. It is conserved. In a collision, the total momentum of the system is conserved, meaning that the total momentum before the collision is the same as the total momentum after the collision. In this case, the child's change in momentum is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the change in momentum of the vehicle, resulting in a conserved total momentum.<br /><br />3. The correct answer is d. Billiard ball A collides with bowling ball B, resulting in a change in momentum. Impulse is the change in momentum of an object, and momentum is conserved during a collision. In the case of a billiard ball colliding with a bowling ball, the momentum of each object changes as a result of the collision, demonstrating the relationship between momentum and impulse.<br />

                            7. what is the main idea below.
- Many learners and teachers have established a wide range of
activities to support approaches to creativity and exploit the features of digital
technologies in processes such as: (a)developing ideas: supporting imaginative
conjecture, exploration and representation of ideas; (b) making connections:
supporting, challenging, informing and developing ideas by making
connections within formation, people, projects and resources; (c) creating and
making: engaging in making meanings though fashioning processes of
capture, manipulation and transformation of media; (d) collaboration:
working with others in immediate and dynamic ways to collaborate on
outcomes and construct shared knowledge; (e) communication and
evaluation: publishing and communicating outcomes for evaluation and
critique from a range of audiences. These activities are not always discrete or
sequential and there can be synchronicity in their expression and overlap of
applications for different purposes. Examples of such activities range from
using simulations and adventure games to explore the question ‘what would
happen if…?’, to publishing hypertext stories or constructing avatars to meet
and interact in three-dimensional, virtual worlds. This wealth of activity
illustrates how children and young people are able to use ICT to demonstrate
creative characteristics in the interaction between people and processes in
subject areas which are authentic, relevant and challenging</h2><br />
