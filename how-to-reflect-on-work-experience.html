                                            DAILY ENCOUNTERS WITH GOD” Your class was tasked by the CBCP’s Episcopal Commission on Youth (ECY) to write a booklet containing short reflections about your daily encounters with God (scenario). This booklet will be published in order to inspire and encourage the Filipino Catholic Youth (audience) to recognize signs of God’s presence in the events of day-to-day life. You will work individually as writers or authors (role) since the task involves writing about your personal experiences or encounters with God. You will write and reflect about your daily encounters with God in your journal notebook (journal file), demonstrating the various signs (natural, biblical, liturgical, or ecclesial) of God’s Revelation around us (goal). Your CLEd teacher will read your journal entries and the best reflections may be submitted to the Campus Ministry office and used as reflection pieces for the school’s spiritual activities. Your work will be graded according to the following standards: 1. Content 2. Relevance 3. Creativity 4. Format Each story/encounter/experience should: Ø be within 15-20 sentences only; Ø have an appropriate title and symbol/image to represent the piece; Ø contain a concrete description of the event or experience which led you to encounter the Lord; Ø describe how you felt given the encounter; Ø identify at least 2 important realizations or insights that you had; Ø Be inspiring to your audience/readers, encouraging them to see God’s presence even in the simple experiences of daily life.

                        I noticed that the planning tool helped our group stay on track and allow us to keep things organized. Using this helped eliminate stress and made the project more enjoyable.We were able to do things carefully without feeling pressured and work independently without any problems.We reduced our stress level by dividing the work and assigning each person a task. We also made sure to have a meeting to discuss the plan before we started working on it.This method of planning can be applied to almost any real-life project. Whether it's planning an event, launching a new product, or organizing a fundraiser, this tool can help to ensure that your project is successful. It helps to make sure that everyone is on the same page, and it also ensures that tasks are completed in a timely manner. This type of planning is essential for any project to be successful, and I'm glad we were able to utilize it in our group project.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Abstract<p></p>In this article it is argued that feelings are all important to the function of literature. In contradiction to music that is concerned with the inwardness of humankind, literature has, because of language, the capacity to create fictional worlds that in many respects are similar to and related to the life world within which we live. One of the most important reasons for our emotional engagement in literature is our empathy with others and our constant imagining and hypothesizing on possible developments in our interactions with them. Hence, we understand and engage ourselves in fictional worlds. It is further claimed and exemplified, how poetic texts are very good at rhetorically engage and manipulate our feelings. Finally, with reference to the important work of Ellen Dissanayake, it is pointed out that the first kind of communication in which we engage, that between mother and in can't, is a kind of speech that positively engages the infant in a dialogue with the mother by means of poetic devices.<p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p>Hope it helps GOOD LUCK..<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>And while this dictum is certainly true, self-reflection is not necessarily an easy thing to practice. We live in an incredibly fast-paced world. Our mobile phones are constantly buzzing, social media is infinitely calling, and Netflix always has something new to binge on.</p><p></p><p>Taking the time for reflection is a bit of a lost art. Most of us, unfortunately, are living unexamined lives.</p><p></p><p>This shouldn’t be the case. Few things are more valuable than self-reflection.</p><p>sana makatulong</p><br />

How might you use what you learned from this interview to support and promote local artists and their work?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>An artist's work can reflect their community or culture in several ways, such as the themes, symbols, or motifs they use, the colors and materials they choose, and the techniques and styles they employ. An artist may draw inspiration from their environment, history, or traditions, and infuse their work with their personal experiences, perspectives, and values. The artist's work can serve as a representation of their community's or culture's unique identity, creativity, and aspirations.</p><p></p><p>After an interview, perceptions of an artist's work may change as one gains insights into their creative process, motivations, and influences. One may also learn about the challenges and rewards of pursuing a career in the arts, and gain a deeper appreciation for the artist's vision and craftsmanship. Surprises may arise when the interview reveals unexpected details about the artist's life or work, or when one discovers unexpected connections between the artist's work and one's own experiences or interests.</p><p></p><p>An artist's work can inspire and impact others in the community in various ways, such as by providing a platform for dialogue, raising awareness about social issues, or fostering a sense of pride and belonging. The artist's work can also serve as a source of beauty, inspiration, and creativity that can stimulate the imagination and promote personal growth and well-being.</p><p></p><p>The experience of interviewing an artist can provide valuable insights into the creative process, the challenges and rewards of pursuing a career in the arts, and the role of art in society. It can also inspire one's own creative pursuits or interests by providing new ideas, techniques, or perspectives, and fostering a deeper appreciation for the value and diversity of artistic expression.</p><p></p><p>This interview can help one gain a deeper understanding of the role of art in society by providing insights into how artists use their work to reflect, challenge, or transform their community's or culture's values, beliefs, and practices. It can also demonstrate how art can serve as a means of communication, education, and social change, and how it can contribute to the well-being and vitality of individuals and communities.<br /><br />To interview artists in their local community, students can reach out to local art galleries, museums, or arts organizations, or conduct online research to identify artists whose work resonates with their interests or the community's values. They can prepare questions that reflect their curiosity and knowledge about the artist's work, and approach the interview with an open mind and a willingness to listen and learn.</p><p></p><p>To support and promote local artists and their work, students can share their interview findings with their community, post them on social media, or organize public events that showcase the artist's work. They can also explore ways to collaborate with the artist or other members of the community to create new works of art that reflect the community's or culture's values and aspirations.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
