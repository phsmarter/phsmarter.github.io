Positive Test: Benedict's solution changesfrom blue to green (very small amount of reducing sugar), to yellow (higher amount of reducing sugar) to orange or brick red.Thighest amount of reducing sugar). The change in color is due to the formation of the brick red precipitate, Cu2o.Procedure:1. This activity will be using given data as assumed results from the activity2 The tables below contain food samples that after a certain chemical was added into it, the color of each samplechanged (color reaction).3. Given the color reaction of each food sample, decide whether the sample tested positive (+) or negative (-).4. Take note of the given positive color reaction for a specific test.

SITUATION:
A seminar will be held virtually to promote awareness among grade school students on the value
of saving money. As an invited speaker, you were tasked to present ways on spending money wisely
especially in this time of pandemic. The principal of the school asked you to prepare a leaflet with two
sample tables that shows how one’s money can be spent using the amount of P20,000, and P30,000.
Every table should have a specific amount for Base, Percentage, and Rate. The cover of leaflet should
reflect the object of promoting the value of saving.
PRODUCT:
A leaflet with 2 sample table inside showing how to save money

TRUE OR FALSE.
1. A cluster random sample is one obtained by using groups as the sample unit rather than individuals.
2. A group of individuals that is conveniently available to be studied is called a systematic sample.
3. A simple random sample is a sample selected from a population in such a manner that all members of the population have an equal chance of being selected.
4. A table of random numbers is a table of numbers, listed and arranged in a specific order.
5. A systematic sample is a specific group of individuals that is kept on call for repeated study.
6. When a study is replicated, it is repeated with a new sample and sometimes under somewhat new conditions.
7. When a categorical variable can be identified that is related to the dependent variable or the variables being studied, the researcher can ensure a more representative sample by selecting participants from each category.
8. A two-stage random sample is a sample selected because the individuals have special qualifications of some sort, or because of prior evidence of representativeness.
9. The term "ecological generalizability" refers to the extent to which the results of the study can be generalized to conditions or settings other than those that prevailed in a particular study.</a>

Do this in your notebook. Personal Experiences Possible Literary Elements to be used UKA MD Knowing your prior knowledge about literary elements and the possible sources of contents using your personal experiences will help you create your own samples of literary elements based on your experiences. You have known already that literary elements are the things that all literatures-whether it is a news article, a book, or a poem-absolutely have to have. Just like a house, the elements might be arranged slightly different. But at the end of the day, they are usually all present and accounted for. Literary elements are the fundamental building blocks of writing. They play an important role in helping us write, read and understand literature. Hartgers (2020) defined literary elements as writing techniques used to create artistic special effects, that immerse the reader into a narrative, story, or text. Literary elements are specific ways that storytellers use words in specific patterns to tell their stories. They are considered as main tools in a writer's toolbox. Popular literary devices include allusion, diction, foreshadowing, imagery, metaphors, similes and personification.​</a>

A seminar will be held virtually to promote awareness among grade school students on the value
of saving money. As an invited speaker, you were tasked to present ways on spending money wisely
especially in this time of pandemic. The principal of the school asked you to prepare a leaflet with two
sample tables that shows how one’s money can be spent using the amount of P20,000, and P30,000.
Every table should have a specific amount for Base, Percentage, and Rate. The cover of leaflet should
reflect the object of promoting the value of saving.

TRUE OR FALSE.
1. A cluster random sample is one obtained by using groups as the sample unit rather than individuals.
2. A group of individuals that is conveniently available to be studied is called a systematic sample.
3. A simple random sample is a sample selected from a population in such a manner that all members of the population have an equal chance of being selected.
4. A table of random numbers is a table of numbers, listed and arranged in a specific order.
5. A systematic sample is a specific group of individuals that is kept on call for repeated study.
6. When a study is replicated, it is repeated with a new sample and sometimes under somewhat new conditions.
7. When a categorical variable can be identified that is related to the dependent variable or the variables being studied, the researcher can ensure a more representative sample by selecting participants from each category.
8. A two-stage random sample is a sample selected because the individuals have special qualifications of some sort, or because of prior evidence of representativeness.
9. The term "ecological generalizability" refers to the extent to which the results of the study can be generalized to conditions or settings other than those that prevailed in a particular study.</h2><br />

Learning Task 3: With your prior knowledge on literary elements and the possible sources of contents about your personal experiences, write on the provided table below the possible literary elements that can be used in telling your personal experiences in the most creative way. Do this in your notebook. Personal Experiences Possible Literary Elements to be used UKA MD Knowing your prior knowledge about literary elements and the possible sources of contents using your personal experiences will help you create your own samples of literary elements based on your experiences. You have known already that literary elements are the things that all literatures-whether it is a news article, a book, or a poem-absolutely have to have. Just like a house, the elements might be arranged slightly different. But at the end of the day, they are usually all present and accounted for. Literary elements are the fundamental building blocks of writing. They play an important role in helping us write, read and understand literature. Hartgers (2020) defined literary elements as writing techniques used to create artistic special effects, that immerse the reader into a narrative, story, or text. Literary elements are specific ways that storytellers use words in specific patterns to tell their stories. They are considered as main tools in a writer's toolbox. Popular literary devices include allusion, diction, foreshadowing, imagery, metaphors, similes and personification.​</h2><br />
