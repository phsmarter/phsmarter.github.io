                            1. In the Philippines, what is the relationship of religion to politics? It what ways is it engage in politics? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Religion and Politics</p><p>The relation between religion and politics continues to be an important theme in political philosophy, despite the emergent consensus (both among political theorists and in practical political contexts, such as the United Nations) on the right to freedom of conscience and on the need for some sort of separation between church and state. One reason for the importance of this topic is that religions often make strong claims on people’s allegiance, and universal religions make these claims on all people, rather than just a particular community. For example, Islam has traditionally held that all people owe obedience to Allah’s will. Thus, it is probably inevitable that religious commitments will sometimes come into conflict with the demands of politics. But religious beliefs and practices also potentially support politics in many ways. The extent and form of this support is as important to political philosophers as is the possibility for conflict. Moreover, there has been a growing interest in minority groups and the political rights and entitlements they are due. One result of this interest is substantial attention given to the particular concerns and needs of minority groups who are distinguished by their religion, as opposed to ethnicity, gender, or wealth.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: Religion Greatly affects the Phillipines  Economically, Politically and Socially in various ways.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Philippines is a religious country. It has been tagged as the only christian nation in South East Asia. As a country that has a lot of Christians our economy, politics and social lives is greatly affected by it, why? Here's how..</p><p>The economy is focused on clients, and the clients are all on this sector. A lot of discussions are done to adjust to these clients. One of which is building numerous holy places where religious people can go to. Another is you cant produce a product that will have a negative impact on this sector. Political; as we all know politics is somewhat governed by the church. Why? Because most of the candidates that was introduced by the church will be most likely to win. Another is the state cannot do anything that will anger the church because they know that they will just receive backlash if they do so. And last socially, well lets face it. The church has standards on how you should act. You should or should not do things that the church may view as morally correct or incorrect. At the end, religion has a massive effect on the Philippines economy, politics and social being.   </p><br />

                         Thirty years ago, on Feb. 22, 1986, then Jaime Cardinal Sin made an urgent call on church-owned Radio Veritas for Filipinos to take to the streets and support the revolt against President Ferdinand E. Marcos. For most Filipinos, Jaime Cardinal Sin’s message was what started the People Power Revolution, with hundreds of thousands of supporters forming a human barricade between Camp Crame and Camp Aguinaldo (thereby protecting the “rebels” – former President Fidel Ramos and Senator Juan Ponce Enrile). It was a show of force and a moment of truth for a nation that wanted freedom from the 20-year Marcos dictatorship. Had people not responded to the Cardinal’s call, Philippine history might have been very different. As candidates vie for endorsements ahead of May 9 general elections, here’s a look back at the role organized churches have had in Philippine politics, and a look ahead at how this might play out in these elections.<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>that's the answer hope it helps</p><br />
