                                            The Russia - Ukraine War
Read the article below and answer the following questions by expressing your own opinion.
1. What lesson/s can we derive from this war?
2. Write down the thesis statement of this article
 The war in Ukraine is unlike any war that’s been. Although it seems local, this war is changing the world. In the end, after all the pain, the parties will establish new relationships, and new relationships will be established around the world. This war is the beginning of a formation of a new world order, where all parties unite against the one common enemy of all of humanity: egoism. It will take time, but everyone involved will realize, and the whole world with them, that they are not fighting against each other, but against an enemy within them. If we let the idea sink in, even a bit, it will make it happen even sooner.
The war that began in late February will not end soon. It will take many more months until everyone realizes that war itself, the very concept of it, is evil. In that sense, the war in eastern Europe is correcting all of humanity, transforming our perception and our understanding of good and evil.
The casualties, the injured, and the lost property are a terrible price to pay. Nevertheless, global processes always come at a cost. We should not blame others for the cost, and we should not think that there is nothing each of us can do to change the world. It is in the hands of every person to change the world for the better, and to make the atrocities of war, and all atrocities that humans are inflicting on each other, disappear. All we need is to realize that the only enemy lies within us—our self-centered attitude. It incites us against each other, demonizes and vilifies anyone who disagrees with us, tells us that we are the only ones entitled in this world, and thereby sets us off against each other. We are all like that, infected with a pandemic of narcissism.
Nevertheless, there is a lot we can do to change the world. First, we must accept that there is a good reason we are so different from each other. Each of us makes a unique contribution to the world that no one else can. If we were all the same, the contributions we receive from others, and on which our lives depend, would be absent, and we would not survive, in the most physical sense of the word.
We will realize that our ego is the enemy only when we realize that singularity is the wrong key word for happiness. Today, the key word for happiness is complementarity—mutual satisfaction of each other’s material, social, emotional, and spiritual needs.
We are living in a world where we are all dependent on each other. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the appliances and gadgets that we use are all made by people we do not know, in places we do not know, and reach us in ways we do not know. But were it not for this chain of myriad unknown individuals, we would not survive, since we cannot provide for our needs by ourselves.
The same goes for social ties. All our connections, communications, and interactions with other people are made possible with the help of countless people who serve us without our awareness. But were it not for them, we would not be able to work or socialize.
Despite this obvious fact, we behave toward others with as little consideration as possible, and when we are nice or considerate, it is because we have an ulterior, selfish motive. We do not have the prerogative to keep up this behavior. We are destroying the world and destroying ourselves.
Back in the 1930s, Baal HaSulam, a great thinker and a great kabbalist, wrote an epic essay titled “Peace in the World.” In it, he writes, “Man is inherently born to lead a social life. Each and every individual in society is like a wheel that is linked to several other wheels placed in a machine.” How odd it is that ninety years ago, before World War II, people already realized that we are all dependent on each other and must behave toward each other with consideration. Just think what we could have avoided had we been more attentive and open-minded.
Now, too, we are headed for a catastrophe unless we pay attention and begin to act like one entity, one global society that works like a single, united family. The war will change the world, but I hope we can change ourselves before the war changes us.

                            7. The Russia - Ukraine War
Read the article below and answer the following questions by expressing your own opinion.
1. What lesson/s can we derive from this war?
2. Write down the thesis statement of this article
 The war in Ukraine is unlike any war that’s been. Although it seems local, this war is changing the world. In the end, after all the pain, the parties will establish new relationships, and new relationships will be established around the world. This war is the beginning of a formation of a new world order, where all parties unite against the one common enemy of all of humanity: egoism. It will take time, but everyone involved will realize, and the whole world with them, that they are not fighting against each other, but against an enemy within them. If we let the idea sink in, even a bit, it will make it happen even sooner.
The war that began in late February will not end soon. It will take many more months until everyone realizes that war itself, the very concept of it, is evil. In that sense, the war in eastern Europe is correcting all of humanity, transforming our perception and our understanding of good and evil.
The casualties, the injured, and the lost property are a terrible price to pay. Nevertheless, global processes always come at a cost. We should not blame others for the cost, and we should not think that there is nothing each of us can do to change the world. It is in the hands of every person to change the world for the better, and to make the atrocities of war, and all atrocities that humans are inflicting on each other, disappear. All we need is to realize that the only enemy lies within us—our self-centered attitude. It incites us against each other, demonizes and vilifies anyone who disagrees with us, tells us that we are the only ones entitled in this world, and thereby sets us off against each other. We are all like that, infected with a pandemic of narcissism.
Nevertheless, there is a lot we can do to change the world. First, we must accept that there is a good reason we are so different from each other. Each of us makes a unique contribution to the world that no one else can. If we were all the same, the contributions we receive from others, and on which our lives depend, would be absent, and we would not survive, in the most physical sense of the word.
We will realize that our ego is the enemy only when we realize that singularity is the wrong key word for happiness. Today, the key word for happiness is complementarity—mutual satisfaction of each other’s material, social, emotional, and spiritual needs.
We are living in a world where we are all dependent on each other. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the appliances and gadgets that we use are all made by people we do not know, in places we do not know, and reach us in ways we do not know. But were it not for this chain of myriad unknown individuals, we would not survive, since we cannot provide for our needs by ourselves.
The same goes for social ties. All our connections, communications, and interactions with other people are made possible with the help of countless people who serve us without our awareness. But were it not for them, we would not be able to work or socialize.
Despite this obvious fact, we behave toward others with as little consideration as possible, and when we are nice or considerate, it is because we have an ulterior, selfish motive. We do not have the prerogative to keep up this behavior. We are destroying the world and destroying ourselves.
Back in the 1930s, Baal HaSulam, a great thinker and a great kabbalist, wrote an epic essay titled “Peace in the World.” In it, he writes, “Man is inherently born to lead a social life. Each and every individual in society is like a wheel that is linked to several other wheels placed in a machine.” How odd it is that ninety years ago, before World War II, people already realized that we are all dependent on each other and must behave toward each other with consideration. Just think what we could have avoided had we been more attentive and open-minded.
Now, too, we are headed for a catastrophe unless we pay attention and begin to act like one entity, one global society that works like a single, united family. The war will change the world, but I hope we can change ourselves before the war changes us.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>One of the most pressing issues that the Philippine society faces today is poverty. Despite the country's growing economy, a significant portion of the population still lives in poverty, with limited access to basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare. A propaganda movement aimed at addressing poverty could focus on promoting economic reforms that would increase access to jobs and basic services for the poor.</p><p></p><p>Another major issue that the Philippine society faces today is political corruption. Corruption is a widespread problem in the Philippines, with many government officials accused of embezzling public funds and engaging in other corrupt practices. A propaganda movement aimed at addressing this issue could focus on promoting transparency and accountability in government, as well as increasing public awareness of the negative effects of corruption on society.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Philippine society also faces many environmental challenges, including deforestation, pollution, and climate change. A propaganda movement aimed at addressing these issues could focus on promoting environmental awareness and sustainable practices, as well as advocating for stronger environmental protection laws and regulations.</p><p></p><p>Overall, there are many issues and challenges facing the Philippine society today, and a propaganda movement aimed at addressing these issues would need to be strategic, focused, and well-organized to be effective.</p><br />

What does it make you think about?6. What are the issues shown in the film related to modern society?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. "Hidden Figures" is a film that tells the story of three brilliant African-American women working at NASA in the 1960s who were instrumental in the early success of the U.S. space program. The film follows the lives of Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, as they navigate the challenges of being women of color working in a predominantly white and male-dominated environment. Despite facing discrimination, segregation, and sexism, the three women make significant contributions to the space program, including calculating the trajectory of the first American in space and ensuring the safe return of astronauts on subsequent missions.</p><p></p><p>2. The character of Katherine Johnson resonated with me the most while watching the movie. Her exceptional mathematical abilities and determination to succeed despite facing numerous obstacles were truly inspiring. I also appreciated the friendship and support she received from her colleagues, particularly from her supervisor Al Harrison, who recognized and valued her contributions to the space program.</p><p></p><p>3. One of the major scientific breakthroughs in the movie was the development of the IBM computer, which allowed for more complex calculations to be made in a shorter amount of time. The movie also highlighted the crucial role that mathematics played in the success of the space program, particularly in determining the trajectories of space flights.</p><p></p><p>4. The main characters faced many scientific challenges throughout the film, including complex mathematical calculations, designing and testing new technologies, and working in high-pressure situations with tight deadlines. Katherine Johnson, for example, had to overcome the challenge of being a woman of color in a field dominated by white men, and had to work tirelessly to prove her worth to her colleagues. Mary Jackson had to fight against segregation and discrimination to gain access to the education and training she needed to become an engineer. Dorothy Vaughan, on the other hand, had to teach herself and her colleagues how to use the new IBM computer, despite being denied access to the formal training.</p><p></p><p>5. This movie made me think about the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace and the significance of recognizing and valuing the contributions of all individuals, regardless of their race, gender, or background. It also highlighted the importance of education and training in unlocking the potential of individuals and achieving scientific breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>6. The issues shown in the film related to modern society include discrimination, inequality, and the underrepresentation of women and people of color in STEM fields. The movie also raises questions about the role of education in promoting social mobility and the importance of providing equal access to education and opportunities for all individuals.</p><p></p><br />
