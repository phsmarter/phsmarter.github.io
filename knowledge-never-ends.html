Write true if the statement is true and false if the stamen is incorrect.
1. Rebounds are credited to the second player that gains clear possession of the ball or to
the player that successfully deflects the ball into the basket for a score
2. Rebounds are divided into two main categories: "offensive rebounds", in which the ball is
recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and "defensive
rebounds",
3. Rebounding is one of the most important aspects of the basketball game which enables
the player to jump
4. Dribbling is easily the most important skill for any basketball player to master
5. Dribbling it is one way of not allowing the player to advance with the ball and make a
score instead of passing it to a teammate to shoot in the basket.
6. Rebounds are also given to a player who tips in a missed shot on his team's offensive
end
7. Ball handling, however, involves knowledge of the game and integrates dribbling, passing
and decision-making.
8. Dedicate a set amount of time each day to just handling the ball and working on your
dribbling and you’ll see progress in no time.
9. Dribbling allows the player to move around the basketball court while he or she is in the
possession of the ball
10.A team rebound is never credited to any player, and is generally considered to be a
formality as according to the rules of basketball,</a>

It is part of the K to 12 curricula implemented by theDepartment of Education. Conducting a research study serves as one of themost important competencies you must acquire as students before youeventually finish the Senior High School curriculum. The leaming you haveafter taking up the Practical Research subjects serve as your knowledgepre-requisite for college learning.Basically, research is conducted to answer an existing phenomenon.According to Shodhganga (2016), research is a “process of collecting,analyzing and interpreting information to answer questions. Withoutconducting a research, an existing problem will never be answeredandaddressed.Research has its characteristics, processes and ethical standardswhich are relevant to ensure its success. The conduct of research isdefinitely important to provide meaning of the world and to give answers toquestions that presently exist.​</a>

                                            Instructions: Translate this poem to Filipino.Time Tested Beauty Tips (by Sam Levenson)For attractive lips, speak words of kindness.For lovely eyes, seek out the good in people.For a slim figure, share your food with the hungry.For beautiful hair, let a child run his or her fingers through it once a day.For poise, walk with the knowledge that you never walk alone.People, even more than things, have to be restored, renewed, revived, reclaimed and redeemed; never throw out anyone.Remember, if you ever need a helping hand, you'll find one at the end of each of your arms.As you grow older, you will discover that you have two hands: one for helping yourself, the other for helping others.The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair. The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides.True beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul. It is the caring that she lovingly gives, the passion that she shows. The beauty of a woman with passing years only grows.patulong namn oh..​</a>

Instructions: Translate this poem to Filipino.Time Tested Beauty Tips (by Sam Levenson)For attractive lips, speak words of kindness.For lovely eyes, seek out the good in people.For a slim figure, share your food with the hungry.For beautiful hair, let a child run his or her fingers through it once a day.For poise, walk with the knowledge that you never walk alone.People, even more than things, have to be restored, renewed, revived, reclaimed and redeemed; never throw out anyone.Remember, if you ever need a helping hand, you'll find one at the end of each of your arms.As you grow older, you will discover that you have two hands: one for helping yourself, the other for helping others.The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair. The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides.True beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul. It is the caring that she lovingly gives, the passion that she shows. The beauty of a woman with passing years only grows.patulong namn oh..​</h2><br />
