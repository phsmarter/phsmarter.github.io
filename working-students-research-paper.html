                                            Practical Research Quarter 42. What is your biggest "SANA" as you finish your Research Paper? Cite here your wishes related to your research. (10 points)My biggest "sana"  is that, I hope the selected student to my research paper will learn and value my work as like them a student's .This particularly help them to enhance there knowledged and may help them to control their time to manage all work that must be done. Although most of the student that I selected know what is time management in all particular basis, but as me a working student who have a lot work to finish will really appreciated the time management in order to passed and get finish on time.Therefore, I don't not say that only working student will just appreciate  and value this research paper, hence those student who have a responsibilities to their families will learn also. As if you can hear the words "time management" is very easy to figure out, but there's a lot of teenager having difficulty to their mental health specially those people having anxiety, trauma, and depression will having trouble to control there time and self. My point is that, in this research i hope the students will learn from this.​</a>

                                            Practical Research
A research study conducted by Torrendon (2017) entitled Difficulties Encountered by the Student Researchers and the Influences on their Research Output revealed that most student researchers have difficulties focus on conflicts in time management. They cannot proceed if most of the time their minds are pre-occupied. When doing a research paper, you must have an enough time to work on. Additionally, having not enough background knowledge is also a factor that affects them since choosing for a research topic will be easy if you have observed well and been listening to the discussions. Lastly, not all of them are having their own media devices that can help them improve their output. There are a lot of ways on how are you going to find those.

Unethical Practices
Ethical Action
1. Joy, a TV. student is planning to
conduct her first research on misbehavior
of fellow students inside the dassroom
However, she has no idea on the ethical
guidelines in conducting such research.
2. Jose was always absent and got
addicted in mobie legends. Though he's an
honor student, he ranked last in the honor
roll. A qualitative research about Jose is
conducted without informing him.
3. Afraid not to graduate, Greg claimed the
research work of his classmate. He erased
the name of the original researcher and
placed his own.
4. A group of GAS students secretly chose
their adviser as the subject of their

This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire andinterview in gathering information about their experiences and related variables.Frequency count, percentage, mean, and chi-square were used as statisticaltools. Results revealed that financial problem was the main factor that motivatedthe students to work on-campus. They experienced varied feelings as happiness,sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite work pressure, working students hadgood time management both for studies and work, with high self-esteem andgood academic performance. The study concluded that participants’ dual rolesin the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helpingthese students, especially on their financial needs for them to finish theirstudies.​</a>

                                            research study conducted by Torrendon (2017) entitled Difficulties Encountered by the Student Researchers and the Influences on their Research Output revealed that most student researchers have difficulties focus on conflicts in time management. They cannot proceed if most of the time their minds are pre-occupied. When doing a research paper, you must have an enough time to work on. Additionally, having not enough background knowledge is also a factor that affects them since choosing for a research topic will be easy if you have observed well and been listening to the discussions. Lastly, not all of them are having their own media devices that can help them improve their output. There are a lot of ways on how are you going to find those.      1.What can you say about the findings of the conducted research of Torrendo? ​</a>

Lived Experiences of On-Campus Working Students (Frigillano et al., 2015)Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this study explored the livedexperiences and struggles of 22 on-campus working students of ISAT U-MiagaoCampus.This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire and interview in gatheringinformation about their experiences and related variables. Frequency count, percentage,mean, and chi-square were used as statistical tools. Results revealed that financialproblem was the main factor that motivated the students to work on-campus. Theyexperienced varied feelings as happiness, sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite workpressure, working students had good time management both for studies and work, withhigh self-esteem and good academic performance. The study concluded that participants'dual roles in the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helpingthesestudents, especially on their financial needs for them to finish their studies.2.

Although most of the student that I selected know what is time management in all particular basis, but as me a working student who have a lot work to finish will really appreciated the time management in order to passed and get finish on time.Therefore, I don't not say that only working student will just appreciate  and value this research paper, hence those student who have a responsibilities to their families will learn also. As if you can hear the words "time management" is very easy to figure out, but there's a lot of teenager having difficulty to their mental health specially those people having anxiety, trauma, and depression will having trouble to control there time and self.

Researchers use samples rather than working with the entire population since the majority of the time, the research's population is large, and it's impossible for them to collect all of the necessary data for each object in the study. The following are five methods for selecting a sample:</p>SIMPLE RANDON SAMPLING  A <strong>simple random sample</strong> is a subset of a population that has been randomly picked. Every member of the population has an exact equal probability of getting chosen using this sampling procedure.   A<strong> simple random sample</strong> is a randomly chosen subset of a population. This sampling process ensures that every member of the population has an exact equal chance of being chosen.SYSTEMATIC RANDOM SAMPLING <strong> Systematic sampling</strong> is a type of probability sampling in which people from a larger population are randomly selected from that group at a fixed, periodic interval. By dividing the population size by the desired sample size, a predetermined periodic interval known as the sampling interval is calculated. If the periodic interval is predetermined and the starting point is chosen at random, <strong>systematic sampling </strong>is still considered random.STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLING Researchers can use<strong> stratified random sampling </strong>to get a sample population that is representative of the overall population under study.CLUSTER RANDOM SAMPLING <strong>Cluster sampling</strong> is a technique for breaking down a population into smaller groupings called clusters. They then select clusters at random to create a sample. <strong>Cluster sampling</strong> is a sort of probability sampling that is widely used to investigate large populations, particularly those dispersed across a vast geographic area. Typically, researchers employ pre-existing units as clusters, such as schools or cities.  <p><strong>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</strong></p><p>Click here for more information about sampling;</p><p>     https://brainly.ph/question/2653344</p><p>     https://brainly.ph/question/2711698</p><p>     https://brainly.ph/question/2700598</p><br />

                            7. Practical Research
A research study conducted by Torrendon (2017) entitled Difficulties Encountered by the Student Researchers and the Influences on their Research Output revealed that most student researchers have difficulties focus on conflicts in time management. They cannot proceed if most of the time their minds are pre-occupied. When doing a research paper, you must have an enough time to work on. Additionally, having not enough background knowledge is also a factor that affects them since choosing for a research topic will be easy if you have observed well and been listening to the discussions. Lastly, not all of them are having their own media devices that can help them improve their output. There are a lot of ways on how are you going to find those. 
What can you say about the findings of the conducted research of Torrendo?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Finding a good topic is essential to producing quality research output. This can be difficult for student researchers, who may lack the background knowledge to identify good topics. Additionally, time management is crucial for research papers. Student researchers may have difficulty focusing on their work if they are preoccupied with other things. Lastly, having access to media devices can improve research output. However, not all student researchers have their own media devices. The findings of the Torrendo study suggest that these factors can influence the quality of student research output.</p><p></p><br />

                        ANSWER:<p></p><p></p><p></p>Cyber Bullying<p></p><p>Cyberbullying or cyberharassment is a form of bullying or harassment using electronic means. Cyberbullying and cyberharassment are also known as online bullying. It has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers, as the digital sphere has expanded and technology has advanced.Cyberbullying is when someone, typically a teenager, bullies or harasses others on the internet and other digital spaces, particularly on social media sites. Harmful bullying behavior can include posting rumors, threats, sexual remarks, a victims' personal information, or pejorative labels (i.e. hate speech). Bullying or harassment can be identified by repeated behavior and an intent to harm.Victims of cyberbullying may experience lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, and various negative emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry, or depressed.</p><p></p><p>Cyberbullying is in many cases an extension of already existing traditional bullying. Students who are bullied via the Internet have, in most cases, also been bullied in other more traditional ways before (e.g, physically or verbally). There are few students who are bullied exclusively over the Internet; these cyber victims are often physically stronger students, which causes bullies to prefer online confrontations over face-to-face contact at school.</p><p></p>#BRAINLYMEDALIST<br />

                        Will the Earth Melt Soon?Introduction<p>The ice glaciers are melting, but the Earth won't. Since the 1950s, Earth's glaciers have been slowly melting as climate change continues to advance. Particularly in mountain glaciers all throughout the world, in Antarctica, and Greenland. Although the ice glaciers in these locations will melt, the Earth won't. Although this might be the cause of the sea levels rising, the ocean would overrun all the coastal cities and a large portion of the land would be submerged. This is the result of climate change that has been continuously deteriorating due to human activity, which has led to the buildup of greenhouse gases that are impacting the warming effect. </p><p></p><p>We could learn how to stop this issue from getting worse so that it doesn't impact all of Earth's life in this study. We might also devise means of determining whether this will cause more significant issues. </p><p></p>Description of the Issue<p>This phenomenon is primarily the result of human activity. In particular, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have increased temperatures in the poles since the industrial revolution. Consequently, glaciers are melting quickly, breaking off into the ocean, and retreating on land. We need to find various strategies to stop this from happening because it could lead to a bigger issue in the future for the next generations. This could serve as a reminder to everyone to avoid practices like deforestation that can exacerbate climate change.</p><p></p>Relevance of the Study<p>This study could be useful in providing additional details on how to address the issue and in educating the public about how negatively their daily activities may impact the environment and pose a significant threat in the future.</p><p></p>Methodology<p>The goal of this research is to discover more strategies to stop glaciers from melting, which could cause more serious issues in the future. To locate the answers to the study questions, I will use online navigation to collect data from several verified websites on the internet.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about the concept paper here:</strong> https://brainly.ph/question/2433638#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

Lived Experiences of On-Campus Working Students (Frigillano et al., 2015)Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this study explored the livedexperiences and struggles of 22 on-campus working students of ISAT U-MiagaoCampus.This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire and interview in gatheringinformation about their experiences and related variables. Frequency count, percentage,mean, and chi-square were used as statistical tools. Results revealed that financialproblem was the main factor that motivated the students to work on-campus. Theyexperienced varied feelings as happiness, sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite workpressure, working students had good time management both for studies and work, withhigh self-esteem and good academic performance. The study concluded that participants'dual roles in the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helpingthesestudents, especially on their financial needs for them to finish their studies.2.

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>My physical and emotional health suffered but my grades did not. Focusing on my studies gave me a visible sign of success. I needed something I could control and grades provided that for me. The research perspective I learned in classes also made me feel more in control at doctor and therapy appointments. Around Finn's third birthday, he reached age level on all developmental and physical tasks. I transitioned from being a caregiver to "just" a parent. The shift was profound. It had a significant impact on my lived experience as a parent, my lived experience as a student, and my lived experience of health. The worry that consumed me, and the exhaustion I felt as a caregiver dissipated when my role was reduced to parent. I was able to focus on my studies in a more balanced way and I had the energy to build relationships with fellow students in my program. I have the benefit of understanding the experience of being a student as both a caregiver and as a non-cargegiver. My personal experience as a student caregiver, combined with my academic path in student affairs, sowed the seeds for this phenomenological study</p><p></p><p>Hope it helps, make me as a brainliest</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: Cyberbullying or cyberharassment is a form of bullying or harassment using electronic means. Cyberbullying and cyberharassment are also known as online bullying. It has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers, as the digital sphere has expanded and technology has advanced.Cyberbullying is when someone, typically a teenager, bullies or harasses others on the internet and other digital spaces, particularly on social media sites. Harmful bullying behavior can include posting rumors, threats, sexual remarks, a victims' personal information, or pejorative labels (i.e. hate speech). Bullying or harassment can be identified by repeated behavior and an intent to harm.Victims of cyberbullying may experience lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, and various negative emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry, or depressed.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Cyberbullying is in many cases an extension of already existing traditional bullying. Students who are bullied via the Internet have, in most cases, also been bullied in other more traditional ways before (e.g, physically or verbally). There are few students who are bullied exclusively over the Internet; these cyber victims are often physically stronger students, which causes bullies to prefer online confrontations over face-to-face contact at school.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            30.  The Grade eleven students were grouped accordingly by the teacher to workon their research paper manuscript on the challenges they areexperiencing in the new normal modalities of learning. After finalizing themanuscript, the assigned leader of the group endorsed their paper to thechosen secretary of the group for encoding.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>On my opinion, a the members or the group that conducted the research has the right to publish their works. Research is about team work. And by that, it means that the credit shouldn't be given to only one member because it was done by the whole group.</p><p></p><p>(Stating my opinion though. Hope it help.
