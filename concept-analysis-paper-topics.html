What were some of the statements of relationships made during the analysis and on what grounds were they formulated and validated? 5. Were there discrepancies and how were they accounted for? 6. How and why was the core theme, is applicable, selected? 7. Are the concepts systematically related? The concepts and their relationships must be developed systematically to generate a theoretical explanation of a phenomenon of interest. 8. Was the process taken into account? A clear discussion of the process enables theory users to explain theory consequences under changing circumstances. 9. Are the theoretical findings significant and to what extent? 10.Do the findings become part of the body of the research topic? pasagot naman po ​</a>

How and why was the core theme, is applicable, selected? 7. Are the concepts systematically related? The concepts and their relationships must be developed systematically to generate a theoretical explanation of a phenomenon of interest. 8. Was the process taken into account? A clear discussion of the process enables theory users to explain theory consequences under changing circumstances. 9. Are the theoretical findings significant and to what extent? 10. Do the findings become part of the body of the research topic? The following sample format can help you in developing your research paper.

Place your answer on a separate sheet of paper. (10 points) 1 Stating the significance of the study is the first phase in writing the background of the study 2. The background of the study includes concepts and ideas related to the problem 3. The aim in the future is presented in the background of the study 4. The parts of the background of the study must be arranged from the topic to the research gap. 5 The gap of the study comes from the situational analysis. 6. The brief review of related literature will include all that are found in various resources or references 7 The purpose of the background of the study is to present what is already known and what is to be investigated further 8. The problems in general are discussed in the background of the study 9. The research questions of the study are included in the background of the study 10.
