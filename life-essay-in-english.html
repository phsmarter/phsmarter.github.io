This skill is essential in achieving success not only in school, but also in future work spaces, including businesses and other organizations. Through the course, I have also discovered that diverse perspectives can lead to better outcomes, and I learned how to leverage different viewpoints to drive success.</p><p></p><p>Finally, I learned the power of being proactive and taking responsibility for creating positive change. LS-4 has taught me how to identify opportunities to make a difference and develop solutions that can contribute positively to the community. By being responsible and accountable for my actions, I can positively impact my life, my future career, and the lives of others.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, I am grateful for the LS-4 Life and Career Skills course that has taught me important life skills that will remain useful even beyond the classroom setting.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Everyone had gotten into this situation now or our past. We use to throw garbage everywhere and throw plastic on the sea without hesitating and to do so. Nonetheless, I'm going to share on about the pollution that I have done in my whole life.</p><p>To be honest, I realized on how much I was immature to make pollution. In my whole life, I used to throw trash everywhere. I always said that the trash would be gone. I was wrong.. I used to play with plastics ALOT, not even trying to recycle or reuse them but ripping plastic and throwing them everywhere like it was a happy, fun, game. Thats when I was wrong..</p><p>I used, to throw on the lake some of my trash with no hesitation because of my laziness to even throw the trash on the correct trashcan. It was very foolish and unforgivable of me.</p><p>I didn't even tried to seperate biodegradable and non biodegradable trash on trashcans. I simply threw any trash without looking at it and throwing them as if I'm helping the environment. But I was wrong, if we're going to avoid pollution, do it the proper way.</p><p>I've caused a large amount of pollution and I regret doing that. Knowing how immature my deeds we're made me feel guilty of it. We should always throw garbage in the correct trashcan, don't be lazy and just throw stuff around. Throwing trash in the water also. But I have regret my decision.</p><br />

                        <p></p><p></p><p>High school was a time of growth and discovery for me. As a freshman, I was nervous about starting at a new school, but I quickly made friends and got involved in extracurricular activities. I joined the debate team and the school newspaper, which allowed me to explore my interests in writing and public speaking. I also took on leadership roles in these organizations, which helped me develop my organizational and communication skills.</p><p></p><p>One of the biggest challenges I faced in high school was managing my time effectively. Between homework, extracurricular activities, and a part-time job, I often felt overwhelmed and stressed. However, I learned to prioritize my tasks and use my time more efficiently. I also learned the importance of self-care and taking breaks when I needed them. Overall, these experiences taught me valuable life skills that have served me well beyond high school.</p><p></p><p>Looking back, I have fond memories of my high school years. I made lifelong friends, gained valuable skills and experiences, and grew into a more confident and capable person. While there were certainly challenges and difficult moments, I wouldn't trade my high school experience for anything. It was a formative time in my life that helped shape me into the person I am today.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>pa brainliests nalang bilang kapalit thanks</strong> </p><br />

                        Healthy diet gawin habit for life, we need to eat healthy so that we wont regret it in a few years when we grow older, because when you grow older the food that you ate when you were younger is the reason why you get sickness for example when you eat sweets you get diabetes when you eat squash your eye sight would be fine. "A healthy outside starts from the inside". This July is one of the memorable months of a school year because it is the Nutrition Month. The motto of this year's nutrition month is "Healthy diet, gawing habit for life!" Indeed, we must make healthy diets a habit. How do you define healthy? Being healthy isn't about eating less, it's about eating the right foods. There are 3 kinds of foods that we should eat, and these are the Go, Grow and Glow foods.<br /><br />First of all, we must eat go foods. Go foods, such as bread, rice, and cereals, give us energy to work and play. If we don’t eat
enough of these, we might feel tired and won’t have enough energy. It is very important to include go foods in all meals, especially breakfast, so that our body and brain can get ready for the
busy school day ahead.<br /><br />Second, we should also eat grow foods. Grow foods enhance growth development and strength. Foods like milk, yogurt, cheese and other dairy products are types of this food group.  Grow foods help build our body’s bones, teeth and muscles. They also keep our brain active and focused.<br /><br />Last but definitely not the least, we must eat glow foods. Glow foods are full of vitamins and minerals to keep our skin, hair, and eyes bright and glowing. Glow foods can keep our immune
system strong so that we can fight against sicknesses. Vegetables and fruits are classified as glow foods. <br /><br /><br />In conclusion, we must make sure to have a healthy diet. Exercising regularly is also part of a healthy diet.  A very simple example of exercising is going up the stairs and running. Remember, a healthy diet helps us to be happy.<br />

When we eat a healthy diet, the body receives the fuel it needs to manage the body's energy level. A healthy diet that includes whole grains, lean meats, low-fat dairy product, fruit, and vegetables can boost the energy levels of the body. Eating a healthy diet also helps control weight that lies on reducing the fats and carbohydrates, helps promote mental health, promotes healthy body growth and many more. It is vital and should be practiced more to improve the body health. (Health Line, 2016)<br /><br />Aside from improving our body health, eating a healthy diet also helps fight diseases.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To become a success in life, we all need to learn to become a good student in every aspect of life. Becoming a good student takes much work and self-discipline. There are many ways that a student can stand out from the rest of the class. These good students are distinguished by their attitude, intellectual skills, consciousness, and achievement.</p><p></p><p>Attitude is primarily a genuine desire to learn and the will to do hard academic work to achieve understanding. It is also shown by how well you apply yourself even to subjects in which you have little interest and how much you can achieve even when a teacher’s style is not what you are used to. Also attitude can change the way you percieveperceive things…show more content…</p><p>No one else can help you to attain a good attitude, you must decide and make it a goal to have a good attitude in your student life. (CS)</p><p></p><p>Consciousness, or awareness, is another helpful aspect of becoming a good student. The good student must be aware of their (agr) surroundings and know what is going on in the world around them. We must strive to relate what is happening around us to what we are learning. This should be important to us because we should care about what is going on politically, academically, socially, and spiritually. Being aware and paying attention is a good trait to continually learn and apply.</p><p></p><p>Achievement is demonstrated by successful application of understanding. This aspect includes using correct and confident knowledge, effective communication, and continuanceing of education through out your life. Achievement gives you a sense of accomplishment and meaning. To become a good student, this must be a goal that you wish to accomplish. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it hepls</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The time of Romantic music is characterized as the period of European classical music that runs generally from 1820 to 1900, as well as music composed concurring to the standards and styles of that period.
