                            1. Gave me an ESSAY about the topic Religion   what different values have your religion instilled in you? including the INTRODUCTION,BODY,and CONCLUTION? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Being religious is a choice, it’s a life style. In a way being religious is also having freedom. You have the freedom to do and pray to who ever you want and worship and be apart of any religion. It’s your choice and nobody can take that choice from you.  Religion is freedom and everybody is entitled to their own beliefs.</p><p></p><p>If I was approached by a person of a different religion then my own and they asked me “why do you worship Mary and the saints?” I would reply “We do not worship Mary and the saints we ask them to help us pray to God for what ever we need and for what ever problem we need help with. When we ask the saints to intercede for us it really means to help us pray to God. For example it’s like you have a problem in life and you need God to help you out. It’s like you ask your friend if they could also pray to God that you find a solution to your problem. So we do not worship Mary and the saints we just ask them to help us pray to God.</p><p></p><p>It is good to pray to God directly if you want to. If its something personal and you do not want anybody to know your problems its fine, it’s no big deal. But God will hear you more and answer your prayers faster if you have like a group or just more than one person praying for you. It doesn’t hurt to have people pray for you and it doesn’t hurt to ask people to pray for you. The more people that pray for you the better your solution will be.</p><p></p><p>The reason why we go through the intercession of saints is because it doesn’t hurt to ask for help it actually makes it better to get help. The saints all have their stories about the hardships in their life’s and the good works they performed. These saints know what you are going through. For example St. Peregrine is the patron saint of cancer patients. St. Peregrine had an incurable cancer in his leg. He was then miraculously healed by God</p><br />

                        <p></p><p></p><p>What is Faith?</p><p>Faith is a peculiar feeling, which is often hard to express and identify. The idea of faith is linked to the concepts of trust and loyalty – and is, therefore, often associated to religion. In this context, faith is defined as total and complete belief in the deity and in its intermediaries (priests, pastors, etc.). In most religions, the deity is worshipped by communities that are brought together by the inexpressible and indefinable feeling of faith, trust and abandonment. Any individual who approaches a religion is bound to question his faith (often for its entire life), as deciding to abandon rationality and empiricism to dive into the uncertainty and mysteries of religion is an important step. Not everyone has the capacity (or the willingness) to question his sets of beliefs and principles to embrace a new truth (the deity). Most scholars define faith (in particular faith in a deity) as a personal, mysterious and individualistic feeling, that can hardly be put into words and that can hardly be rationalized.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>What is Religion?</p><p>Although there is no common agreement on the meaning and main features of religion, the term often refers to a social and cultural system, created by a group of men who worship a common deity. Religions can be very different (i.e. monotheist, polytheist, animist, etc.) and can be characterized by very different rituals and procedures. Religious practices may include veneration, initiations, matrimonies, funerals, prayer, art, music, rituals, sermons, sacrifices, public services and many other aspects of a person’s life. Furthermore, religions have history, narratives, books, sacred places, ethical and moral standards and symbols. Man has always looked at deities, gods and supernatural forces to give a meaning and purpose to life, and to understand the idea of death (and of life after death). Some of the main (and most common) religions include:</p><p></p><p>Christianism;</p><p>Islamism;</p><p>Buddhism;</p><p>Shintoism;</p><p>Taoism;</p><p>Confucianism; and</p><p>Hinduism.</p><p>Religion is a source of comfort for men and women, but it has also been (and continues to be) the origin of conflicts, wars and discrepancies between cultures and social groups.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>Similarities between Faith and Religion</p><p>As faith and religion are strictly linked and can be co-dependent, we can identify few similarities between the two. Indeed, in this case we are considering faith in the sense of religious faith – individual belief in a deity (or god) that can be expressed through religion and its rituals and procedures. Some of the main similarities between faith and religion include:</p><p></p><p>The two concepts can be co-dependent. In fact, some religions were (and are) created on the basis of beliefs and faith, while faith is the key element that brings communities together and that holds the entire religious structure;</p><p>Faith and religion are tools that shape cultures and social structures (and vice versa). They are key elements that characterize specific cultural groups and that allow individuals to find their identity within larger groups; and</p><p>Religion and faith are mutually reinforcing. A person’s growing faith can strengthen the religious structure and create a stronger bond within the group. At the same time, a compelling religious argument can lit the spark of faith in some individuals.</p><p>Difference between Faith and Religion</p><p>Faith and religion are similar, yet very different, concepts. Religions are historic and cultural systems that evolve with time, while faith is an individualistic, personal feeling of one person. Indeed, faith can be shared and others can start accepting and believing in certain things/deities/procedures, but, in general, faith is a much narrower concept if compared to religion. Some of the main differences between the two include:</p><p></p><p>Faith can be a very irrational belief (or, at least, it may seem irrational to others) and can be very complicated to express and share with others. Religion is a means through which people can express their faith. For instance, Christians believe in Jesus, God and the Holy Spirit, and the mass and all other Christian rituals are a way to celebrate their faith and to strengthen their believes;</p><p>Religion is a social construct that evolves with time and that can bring people together, but can also divide families and create discrepancies and clashes among societies. Conversely, faith has a much smaller impact on society, as it is an individualistic feeling that may never be expressed;</p><p>Religion is based on rituals and procedures (i.e. ceremonies, prayers, initiations, public services, art, etc.) while faith is not linked to any of these concepts, but can be expressed in various different ways. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana pkakatulong</p>pa brainliest po<p></p><p></p><br />
