response to each of the following situations.
A)
The coworker with whom you 
share a small cubicle habitually 
leaves papers, files, and books 
strewn all over her desk. The litter 
bugs you. Besides, you are 
concerned it gives your clients a 
bad impression.
B)
The assistant manager of a 
bookstore is faced with a 
customer demanding a refund for 
a book he claims was a gift. The 
book has several crumpled pages 
and a torn cover.
C)
You are facilitator of a student 
group writing a research report 
worth half of your grade for the 
term. One group member misses 
two meetings without contacting 
you. When he returns, he 
explains he had a family emergency and asks what he can 
do to make up the work
D)
At a meeting, you present a 
proposal that angers one of your 
coworkers. He attacks you 
verbally, claiming you don’t have 
your facts right.
E)
Both you and your coworker-
friend are excellent in your work.
Your boss told you that only one 
of you will be promoted 
depending on who will be able to 
reach the quota first. You need 
the promotion because you are 
helping your parents send your 
sibling to school. But your 
coworker-friend mentioned that 
he also needed an increase 
because he has to enroll in 
business school.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I would try and help them by making them realize what they can do, by making themselves know what their own potential is, by making them believe in their selves, that they can do it if they believe that they can do it, since even if i try my hardest to encourage them, to help them, It wouldn't change much if they, themselves don't believe that they could do it. </p><p>when someone believes and is passionate that they can do something.. they will try and try until they have done it.  </p><p></p><p>If Your coworkers are falling behind then that just means that they believe that they would not be of much help, and that they, themselves dont believe that they can do it. and sometimes others are just ignorant and believe that their teammates can do it without them, and can still get some recognition or will be known to have given some efforts to the project even when they haven't.</p><p></p><p>Cooperation between teammates is very important in a team project, because there is teamwork, Not just one's effort but everyone's effort is put into it.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Ask, don't command. Simply by asking instead of commanding, my goal will be accomplished far more effectively. ...</p><p>2.Emphasize what to do, not what to avoid. ...</p><p>3.Explain why it's important. ...</p><p>4.Give freedom of action. ...</p><p>5.Remember, it's a dialogue.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To illustrate this approach, consider this scenario with one of my staff members: These certainly seem like straightforward instructions
. Here is the ultimate method for giving directions so that your employees understand and act—the first time.
</p><p>
</p><p>Ask, don’t command
</p><p>Simply by asking instead of commanding, my goal will be accomplished far more effectively.  It would do better to ask, “Y/N, can you have this report on my desk by 1:30 pm on Tuesday afternoon?”
</p><p>
</p><p>Emphasize what to do, not what to avoid
</p><p>Research has shown that it is far more successful to highlight what it is you want done (proofreading the report) rather than what you want to avoid (typos). So my message becomes, “Y/N, can you have this report proofread and on my desk by 1:30 pm on Tuesday afternoon?”
</p><p>
</p><p>Explain why it’s important
</p><p>If you want to increase the likelihood of getting the end-result you desire from your employees, tell them why what you’re trying to communicate matters. In the workplace.
</p><p>
</p><p>The new formulation is longer, but it’ll save you having to repeat yourself later: “Y/N, can you have this report proofread and on my desk by 1:30 pm on Tuesday afternoon? I have to present it at a client meeting first thing on Wednesday morning, and I want to make sure I have some time to read it over before the meeting.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Give freedom of action
</p><p>No one likes being micro-managed, particularly if they’re competent. So give your employees freedom of action. I can let Jasmin decide if she wants to work on the report this afternoon or tonight or tomorrow. I don’t need to tell her to “work on it tonight if you have to.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Remember, it’s a dialogue
</p><p>So I need to wait for a response to confirm understanding. The sequence then becomes: “Jasmin, can you have this report proofread and on my desk by 1:30 pm on Tuesday afternoon?” *Wait for an answer*
</p><p>If y/n says “Yes, no problem,” respond: “I have to present it at a client meeting first thing on Wednesday morning, and I want to make sure I have some time to read it over before the meeting.”</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        What are your strengths that your boss or coworkers would say about you?<p>One thing I've observed is that I'm always the go-to person for advice on how to handle a new event or program—the newest fundraiser, for example, is one of them. I have a lot of institutional knowledge, which helps, but I believe people come to me because I methodically work through what a new program might look like. I'm convinced that if you asked my co<strong>work</strong>ers, they would describe me as logical, methodical, and careful.</p><p>I don't want to speak for anyone else about my <strong>work</strong>, but I'm pretty sure my co<strong>work</strong>ers would describe me as thoughtful—I'm the one who remembers everyone's birthdays—and hard<strong>work</strong>ing, because I can always be counted on to finish a huge assignment. My boss, in particular, considers me to be an expert on audience development, which is why I continued to take on more and more responsibilities in that area<strong> work</strong> field.</p><p></p><p>What’s something positive your boss would say about you? </p><p>brainly.ph/question/23674757</p><p></p><p>#letsstudy</p><br />
