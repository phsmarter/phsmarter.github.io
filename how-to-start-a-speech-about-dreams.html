While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his ricefield, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education.

First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation.

I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses.

the most popular declamation pieces before a large crowd during their English
Fest.

of Dr. Eugene, being the guest of honor in their graduation rites.

Jeremias. Just as he was about to sit on his chair, his teacher asked him for his
reason for coming to class late.

entourage, to go on stage and share to the group his fun memories with Denver,
the groom.
15.Mr. Jacaba was invited to talk about his struggles in life and how he managed to
overcome them. He was very certain what points he would include in his talk and

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.  President Manuel L. Quezon <strong>can indeed inspired anyone to pursue his/her dreams no matter how difficult their situation could get</strong>.  Compared to his time, we have more opportunities to live a better, more fulfilled life since we live in a freer society.  Moreover, his example as public servant can also inspired people to pay it forward and do what they can to help others.</p><p>2.  For sure, <strong>he wants to inspire the youth of his time to dream big and do what they can to chase their dreams</strong>.  From a simple family that lives on a meager four-peso monthly income, he has come a long way to becoming a leader of the republic.  His fine example has outlived many generations  and continues to inspire people at this time. <strong>He also probably wants to encourage the people to help one another </strong>which is important in uplifting their lives.</p><p>3. It can make young people <strong>rethink how important it is that to value every opportunity that they are handed right now</strong>.  It may be in the form of education which not everyone gets to have.  They better start focusing on things that matter to to them as a student, and make sure they are doing their best.  </p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

                            16. Directions: Read the statements very carefully and tell whether it is a MANUSCRIPT,
MEMORIZED, EXTEMPORANEOUS, or an IMPROMPTU speech. Write your
answer on a separate sheet of paper.
1. With all confidence, Aja Gray delivered Martin Luther’s “I Have A Dream,” one of
the most popular declamation pieces before a large crowd during their English
Fest.
2. Mr. Insong was scheduled for a teaching demonstration. He chose the topic he
was most comfortable with and rehearsed his demonstration. Because he didn’t
want to forget the order of his presentation, he made an outline of his lesson on
an index card to remind him of the flow of the topics or ideas.
3. Father Delos Santos reads every single word from the Holy Scripture to the mass
goers.
4. Mommy Rose reads the story of “Pedro Pinduko” to baby Ralph.
5. Karen Davila reported the news written on a teleprompter.
6. Reina Eunice was asked by Jean to give a short message for the couple during
the reception. She wanted to decline but didn’t want to disappoint her friend, so
she talked whatever came to her mind anyway.
7. Mirasol was heading home from work when Cecilia came up to her and asked
where she could find the nearest Palawan Pera Express Padala Center in the
area.
8. Vincent rehearsed his valedictory address weeks before the graduation. On the
day of the graduation, he delivered it without bringing any notes.
9. Mr. San Juan delivered an inspirational talk. In the beginning of his talk, he
appeared very certain and inspiring but seemed to lose connection with the
audience at the middle of his speech and started groping for words to say next.
10.Mr. Lloyd, being the master of ceremonies, reads the educational achievements
of Dr. Eugene, being the guest of honor in their graduation rites.
11.Mr. Alvarico showed his Grade 12-Phosphenes students a picture. He gave them
a minute to look at it, then asked Andy to share to the class what she thought
about the picture.
12.Jonathan slowly came inside the room hoping he would not be noticed by Mr.
Jeremias. Just as he was about to sit on his chair, his teacher asked him for his
reason for coming to class late.
13.Jenelyn, being the class president, read aloud to the class the announcement
and the dictated exam that Mrs. Lourdes, the TLE teacher, asked her to read
during their time, since she was still in a meeting with the principal.
14.Reynaldo, the reception host, called Julian, who never had any part or role in the
entourage, to go on stage and share to the group his fun memories with Denver,
the groom.
15.Mr. Jacaba was invited to talk about his struggles in life and how he managed to
overcome them. He was very certain what points he would include in his talk and
in which order. To guide him through the speech, he brought with him a notecard
containing the outline of the points he wanted to discuss.</h2><br />
