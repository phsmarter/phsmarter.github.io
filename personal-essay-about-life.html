                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The problem I never solved in my personal life is the struggle to balance my personal and professional life. I have always been a driven and ambitious person, and I have dedicated a lot of time and energy to my career. However, this focus on work has sometimes come at the expense of my personal relationships and my own well-being.</p><p></p><p>I have found it difficult to find a healthy balance between my career and my personal life. I have often worked long hours and taken on additional responsibilities at the expense of spending time with my loved ones and taking care of myself. This has led to feelings of guilt and resentment, and I have sometimes felt like I am neglecting important aspects of my life.</p><p></p><p>I have tried various strategies to address this problem, such as setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care. However, I have not yet found a solution that works for me consistently. I continue to struggle with this issue and it remains a source of frustration and dissatisfaction in my life.</p><p></p><p>In the future, I hope to find a better way to balance my personal and professional life and to find fulfillment and happiness in both aspects of my life. This is a problem that I will continue to work on and strive to solve.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            6. write an essay about the importance of peace in each person’s life and how to achieve it</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Peace is a state of nonsuffering as well as a celebration of life. We now know from many spiritual teachers that we can make a choice to live in peace within our own hearts, that we can actually choose not to suffer and choose instead to live in gratitude and love. Not only that, but we are also learning that finding and claiming that peace within us is essential to creating a world at peace. Because all of life is interconnected, our fear, hatred and anger decreases the peace in the world, whereas our love, joy and gratitude increases the peace.</p><p></p><p>Why is peace important? Without it, the destructive tendencies of our species will continue to inch us closer to catastrophe. The Gulf oil spill is but one example. But we human beings, in our true essence, are capable of the most glorious and uplifting actions. We have the potential to create a world at peace and become what I like to call “Homo Ahimsa” — the nonviolent human.</p><p></p><p>But is peace only important to human beings? And can we end wars and human suffering without ending the suffering of billions of animals who die daily at the hands of people for food, skins, useless experiments, entertainment and other forms of domination? These violent and brutal actions must stop if we are to create a nonviolent world. As Albert Schweitzer said, “Until man extends his circle of compassion to include all living things, man will not himself find peace.” We are connected, not just to each other, but to all of life. The animals and the natural world have much to teach us about peace, silence, being and celebrating life. We are immensely capable of creating a new, beautiful and nonviolent world for all who live here. May peace reign in our hearts and in our world for all beings everywhere.</p><br />

                        <p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Life is something that requires a considerable amount of physical and mental effort. Some are fortunate enough to have everything prepared for them.  Such as some are born into money; some come across good fortune yet most work hard from the start to get some where in the world. It just all depends on how you were brought into this world. For some people, life is full of stress and hardships. That’s how life was for someone very dear to me. He had it difficult from the start. However he chose not to let life get him down. When life gave him lemons, he made lemonade. From the day that high school started, he had to work to support his seven siblings and his mother. Along with his father he worked hard to support his family.</p><p><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p><strong>sana </strong><strong>po </strong><strong>maka </strong><strong>tolung:</strong><strong>)</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Rodrigo Roa, born March 28, 1945, also known as Digong and Rody, is a Filipino politician who is the current president of the Philippines and the first from Mindanao to hold the office. He is the chairperson of PDP–Laban, the ruling political party in the Philippines. Duterte took office at age 71 on June 30, 2016, making him the oldest person to assume the Philippine presidency. The record was previously held by Sergio Osmeña at the age of 65. Born in Maasin, Southern Leyte, Duterte studied political science at the Lyceum of the Philippines University, graduating in 1968, before obtaining a law degree from San Beda College of Law in 1972. He then worked as a lawyer and was a prosecutor for Davao City, before becoming vice mayor and, subsequently, mayor of the city in the wake of the Philippine Revolution of 1986. Duterte won seven terms and served as mayor of Davao for over 22 years.Frequently described as a populist and a nationalist, Duterte's political success has been aided by his vocal support for the extrajudicial killing of drug users and other criminals. Duterte's political career has also received scrutiny. Various human rights groups documented over 1,400 killings allegedly by death squads operating in Davao between 1998 and 2016. The victims were mainly drug users, petty criminals, and street children. A 2009 report by the Philippine Commission on Human Rights confirmed the "systematic practice of extrajudicial killings" by the Davao Death Squad. The Office of the Ombudsman closed an investigation in January 2016 stating that citing no evidence, but the case has since been reopened and reports of Duterte repeatedly confirmed that he personally killed criminal suspects as during his term as mayor of Davao surfaced.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana po makatulong iyan..</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Montesquieu was one of the great political philosophers of the Enlightenment. Insatiably curious and mordantly funny, he constructed a naturalistic account of the various forms of government, and of the causes that made them what they were and that advanced or constrained their development. He used this account to explain how governments might be preserved from corruption. He saw despotism, in particular, as a standing danger for any government not already despotic, and argued that it could best be prevented by a system in which different bodies exercised legislative, executive, and judicial power, and in which all those bodies were bound by the rule of law. This theory of the separation of powers had an enormous impact on liberal political theory, and on the framers of the constitution of the United States of America.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            12. essay about religion and how helpful is it towards your personal outlook in life</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Religion is a complex and deeply personal topic that has played a significant role in the lives of countless individuals throughout human history. For some people, religion provides a sense of comfort, purpose, and guidance in their daily lives. Others may view religion as a source of conflict or oppression, while still others may be indifferent or uncertain about its role in their lives. In this essay, we will explore the role of religion in personal outlook and how it can be helpful to individuals in various ways.</p><p></p><p>Religion can be defined as a set of beliefs, practices, and values that seek to provide individuals with a sense of meaning and purpose in life. For many people, religion serves as a guide for ethical behavior, offering a framework for understanding right and wrong, good and evil. Religious teachings often emphasize the importance of compassion, forgiveness, and service to others, which can help individuals to develop a sense of empathy and connectedness to the wider world.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant benefits of religion is its ability to provide individuals with a sense of comfort and solace in times of crisis or hardship. Many religious traditions offer prayers, rituals, and ceremonies that can help people to find strength and hope in difficult circumstances. These practices can also help individuals to connect with a higher power or a sense of transcendence that can provide a sense of perspective and inner peace.</p><p></p><p>Religion can also help to foster a sense of community and belonging. Many religious traditions involve regular gatherings and celebrations, such as weekly services or annual holidays, that bring people together in a spirit of fellowship and unity. These gatherings can provide individuals with a sense of support and connection to others who share their beliefs and values, which can be particularly important for individuals who feel isolated or marginalized in other aspects of their lives.</p><p></p><p>In addition to its spiritual and emotional benefits, religion can also provide individuals with a sense of purpose and direction in life. Many religious traditions emphasize the importance of living a life of meaning and service, which can help individuals to develop a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction in their daily lives. Religious teachings may also provide guidance on important life decisions, such as career choices or personal relationships, which can help individuals to navigate the challenges and complexities of modern life.</p><p></p><p>Despite the many benefits of religion, it is important to recognize that it can also have negative effects on individuals and society as a whole. Religion has been used to justify discrimination, violence, and oppression throughout history, and some religious traditions may promote beliefs or practices that are harmful or exclusionary. It is important to approach religion with a critical and reflective mindset, recognizing its potential for both good and bad.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, religion can be a powerful force for good in the lives of individuals, providing comfort, community, and purpose. For those who find meaning and solace in their religious beliefs, religion can be a source of strength and inspiration. However, it is important to approach religion with an open and critical mind, recognizing its potential for both positive and negative effects. Ultimately, the role of religion in personal outlook will depend on the individual, their beliefs, and their experiences</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa Brainliest Po </p><br />

                            14. essay about personal life showing the relationship between self, society and culture. sana po matulungan nyo ko . please thank you po​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In our personal lives, we are constantly interacting with society and culture. These interactions shape our sense of self and shape how we view the world around us. Our culture and society create the framework for how we understand ourselves, our relationships with others, and our place in the world.</p><p></p><p>Self is a complex concept that is constantly evolving. It is influenced by our experiences, our beliefs, and our interactions with others. As we grow and develop, our self-concept changes. We learn new things about ourselves, we form new relationships, and we gain new experiences. Our culture and society also play a role in shaping our self-concept. For example, the values and beliefs of our culture shape how we view ourselves and our place in the world.</p><p></p><p>Society is the network of relationships that shape our lives. It is the collection of people and institutions that we interact with on a daily basis. Society shapes how we interact with others, how we view the world, and how we understand ourselves. Our culture and society also create the norms and expectations for how we should behave and interact with others. For example, our culture's norms for gender roles shape how we view ourselves as men and women.</p><p></p><p>Culture is the shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviors, and artifacts that define a group or society. It is the shared understanding of how the world works and how we should live in it. Culture shapes how we view the world and how we understand ourselves. For example, the culture's beliefs about what is considered beautiful shape how we view ourselves and our physical appearance.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, self, society and culture are closely related. Our self-concept, our relationships with others, and our place in the world are all shaped by our interactions with society and culture. As we grow and develop, we learn new things about ourselves and the world around us, and our self-concept changes. Society and culture provide the framework for how we understand ourselves, our relationships with others, and our place in the world. Understanding these relationships can help us to better understand ourselves and the world around us.</p><p></p>Pa Brainliest po, Thanks<br />

                            18. Write a short essay about your personal Philosophy in life and How you apply it in​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> Philosophy of life is an overall vision of or attitude toward life and the purpose of life (Merriam Webster). This point in my life I have taken a few values that I hold in high regards. These values include family, friendship, moral, love, education, optimist, happiness, and purpose. I will be describing in this essay my philosophy and why I hold these values of high regards in my life.</p><p></p><p>Family</p><p></p><p>Family is one of my top values and something I hold dear in my life. From the moment I was brought into this world family has been a mix of experiences and emotions for me. “There are times when wisdom cannot be found in the chambers of parliament or the halls of academia but at the unpretentious setting of the kitchen table (E.A. Bucchianeri).” It is family that helps you though the hard times. From something small like an injuries to illnesses and divorce. Family will be there to help you through those hard times. It could be something as simple as helping with the bills or taking you to the treatments.</p><p></p><p>One of the values my family has taught me is always work hard. If I receive a payment or gift, then I earned it though the hard work I put into the activity or job. My mother always said that nothing in life is ever free someone is always paying for it. To truly take value in your accomplishment, you have to earn them. There</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I understand that an attempt to describe my value of love is connected with a great amount of mystery and hard to truly define. Love is too deep, and we can’t truly define it (Aristotle, 2010). I think that for the majority of people love defines happiness and purpose in ones life. When I do not have a feeling of love, I don’t feel complete concern towards them, or I can’t be happy to full extent as there happiness. It is similar to the concept out of site out or mind (Macionis, 2005). No matter how successful my career is, it is means nothing without loved ones around</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            20. reflectictive essay about during this covod19 pandemic, what do you think is the importance of physical activities in your own personal life?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>The benefits of physical activity and exercise have been demonstrated across the lifespan. We are meant to move and many of our body’s systems work better when we are consistently physically active.</p><p></p><p>For managing symptoms of depression, some research suggests that elevated levels of aerobic activity (exercise that significantly raises our heart rates) may be associated with greater reductions in depressive symptoms. Consider engaging in physical activity once or twice daily that includes brief periods (30-90 seconds) of greater intensity. For some, this might be accomplished through exercise in their homes including jumping jacks, mountain climbers, and sequencing strength training exercises (i.e. standing squats, push-ups, sit-ups). For others, the use of home exercise equipment such as treadmills, elliptical machines, and stationary bikes may be helpful.</p><p></p><p>Strength-training has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety for individuals with and without an anxiety disorder. Weightlifting using exercise equipment or household items (textbooks, canned goods, milk jugs filled with water, paint cans) may help us to reduce the negative effects of stress and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>For children and adolescents, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and exercise during the day are associated with elevations in self-esteem, improved concentration, reductions in depressive symptoms, and improvements in sleep.</p><p></p><p>For older adults and among individuals managing chronic medical conditions, regular walks are recommended. The benefits of strength training and weightlifting (low weight with high numbers of repetitions) may be even greater in older adults to maintain quality of life and functioning.</p><p></p><p>Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (such as speed-walking or jogging) has been shown to help reduce the use of alcohol and other substances. Additionally, participation in regular physical activity is shown to boost the immune system. Reduction in substance use is also associated with improvement in the body’s ability to fight off infection.</p><p></p><p>Many companies are offering free use of their on-line platforms that may help to identify a variety of in-home activities (indoor cycling, treadmill running, dance cardio, yoga, strength training, and more) to help make exercise more enjoyable during this critical period. We strongly support the idea of ongoing vigilance regarding physical-distancing and limitations on in-person contacts as guided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(link is external).</p><p></p><p>We recommend finding physical activities that you enjoy and to share your experience with others. At the same time, there is also evidence to suggest that exercise can be helpful to mood even if the act of doing the exercise is not as enjoyable.</p><p></p><p>It is important for family members to take a supportive role in the promotion of physical activity and exercise. Allowing individuals to maintain their autonomy and choice in their activities will be important for ongoing engagement.</p><p></p><p>We are all managing additional stress related to the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential to threaten the health of ourselves, our families, and our communities. Please consider using physical activity and exercise as a strategy to maintain health during this stressful period.</p><p></p><p>Although many things feel beyond our control right now, we do have the ability to be creative and to build physical activity and exercise into each of our days. We may even look back on this difficult time as the turning point when we learned new ways to build our emotional resilience and our physical health.</p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />
