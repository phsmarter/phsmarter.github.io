WHAT WAS YOUR LAST LESSON?
THE BUNNY AND THE TURTLE RACE
Once upon a time, there was a fast Bunny who boasted about how
fast he could run. The Turtle, tired of hearing him brag, challenged him to a
sprint. The forest's animals had gathered to watch.
The Bunny jogged down the path for a while before stopping to rest.
"How do you expect to win this race if you're walking along at your slow,
slow pace?" he yelled back at the turtle. The Bunny started to feel tired and
decided to take a nap thinking that there is plenty of time to relax while the
turtle is walking too slow.
The Turtle walked and walked until he reached the finish line, never
stopping. The animals in the audience chanted for Turtle so loudly that they
awoke the Bunny. The Bunny stretched and yawned before resuming his
sprint, but it was too late. Turtle had already completed the race.

WHAT WAS YOUR LAST LESSON?
THE BUNNY AND THE TURTLE RACE
Once upon a time, there was a fast Bunny who boasted about how
fast he could run. The Turtle, tired of hearing him brag, challenged him to a
sprint. The forest's animals had gathered to watch.
The Bunny jogged down the path for a while before stopping to rest.
"How do you expect to win this race if you're walking along at your slow,
slow pace?" he yelled back at the turtle. The Bunny started to feel tired and
decided to take a nap thinking that there is plenty of time to relax while the
turtle is walking too slow.
The Turtle walked and walked until he reached the finish line, never
stopping. The animals in the audience chanted for Turtle so loudly that they
awoke the Bunny. The Bunny stretched and yawned before resuming his
sprint, but it was too late. Turtle had already completed the race.
_________5. Eating vegetables and fruits are healthier than eating
junk foods.

decided to take a nap thinking that there is plenty of time to relax while the
turtle is walking too slow.
