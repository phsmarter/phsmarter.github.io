                        One <strong>theory about bullying</strong> is that it is a learned behavior that is reinforced by positive outcomes such as increased social status or control over others.<p></p>Studies have shown that children who witness or experience bullying may develop mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. They also have shown that children who bully others may have a lack of empathy, difficulty regulating their emotions, and a desire for power and control.<p></p>Another <strong>theory about bullying and learning</strong> is that it can negatively impact a student's ability to focus and succeed academically. Students who are bullied may have difficulty paying attention in class, completing assignments, and achieving their academic goals.<p></p>Research also suggests that there is a relationship between bullying and academic performance. Students who are bullied may have lower grades, test scores, and graduation rates than those who are not bullied. Additionally, students who bully others may also have lower academic performance due to disciplinary actions or the negative effects of bullying on their own mental health.<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.

                        <br />We are living in a world where some people think that violence is the only reason to solve every problem.  If people keep this violence around us, it’s not going to get better. Violence has been in this world for centuries now and for the same causes, to gain power of authority. Kids in schools feel superior to others by calling other kids horrible names and making fun of them. Men hit women so they can “earn” their respect back. The point is that violence won’t make you a better person, it will make you a monster and nobody likes a monster.<br /><br />There are many different kinds of violence. One of them is called bullying. The victims of this violence are mostly kids and teenagers around the ages of 10-18. Bullying is when someone says mean things to someone in person or in a social network. Most of the time it happens in the social network because kids thing that by making fun of someone in a social network area, they won’t get in trouble by an adult. This is one of the worst violence in the world because is between kids and teenagers. Most of the teenagers today have very low self-esteem because of the media. They haven’t still found what they want to do with their lives, so, by saying mean things to them, it won’t help them be successful since they think that what they are saying is true.<br /><br />There are over 3.2 million of students that are victims of bullying each year. Because of these, approximately 160,000 teens skip school every day to avoid the bullies. Some of these students drop out of school. Some schools don’t even help the victims that are been bullied. Over two-thirds of students believe that schools respond poorly to bullying, with high percentage of students believing that adult help is infrequent and ineffective. I didn’t know that harassment and bullying has been linked to 75 percent of school-shooting incidents.<br /><br />There have been many cases of suicide because of bullying. One of the recent ones was the suicide of Amanda Todd. She committed suicide on October 10, 2012 at her home in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada.  She was 16 years old when she died. On September 7, 2012, she posted a 9-minute video on YouTube titled My Story: Struggling, bullying, suicide and self-harm, which showed her using flash cards telling her experiences being bullied.  The reason she was bullied was because when she was in 7th grade, she used video chat to meet new people over the internet. People she met would always give her complements about her looks. A stranger convinced her to bare her breasts on camera. He later blackmailed her with threats to expose the topless photo to her friends unless she gave a “show”. The photo of her circulated the internet. She moved to different places to start fresh, but the individual would always disguise himself as a student coming new to school. She tried to kill herself by drinking bleach and an overdose of drugs, but it didn’t work. Students from her school would make fun of her because she failed in her suicide and in her grades. After the entire nightmare, on October 10, 2012 at about 6:00 PM, she was found hanged at her home.<br /><br />Like I said before, most of the teenagers have a very low self-esteem and by telling them mean things, they will only become worst. Everybody makes mistakes. Kids today are always in the internet and they meet strangers everyday. As a parent, you need to pay attention to everything that the kid is doing. If you don’t want to have problems like this, don’t talk to strangers over the internet. Once it’s on the internet it stays there forever.  If you see someone that is being bullied over the internet or at school, contact an adult or confront the person yourself. If we all stand up together against bullying, the world will be a better place. You might think that the one that you are making fun of is a monster because of the stuff he or she has done, but in reality, you are the monster for making them feel worst.<br /><br />Be the change of a good person dont wait for the time that everyone leaves you<br />

                        <p><strong>Ans:          The new normal is rather new for every person out there in the Philippines which all of us are afraid to get sick or endanger our families. The new normal is rather at least better than ECQ which caused a lot of people to get depressed and suicide due to depression. The New Normal is great since now we can see each other and meet and go places that we havent been to, and kids now can be free and see things in the outside after a long time in the house being caged like a bird, now we can spread our wings and see the world once again freely.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:    Hope it helps</strong></p><p><strong>                           #StaySafe</strong></p><p><strong>                           #KuyaHelper</strong></p><p>                          </p><br />

I hear a lot of people struggle to find a distraction-free space at home that is conducive to do productive and effective work. For myself, I feel like it takes twice as much time, effort, and energy to do even simple tasks, which can be quite draining. I’ve really had to be very compassionate and patient with myself lately. Others may be struggling with the fatigue, frustration, sadness, anger, grief, and anxiety (among other things) of adjusting.

                        <p></p><p>Bullying in kindergarten, elementary and secondary education is not a new phenomenon. While schools are expected to be a safe haven for our children, they can still be pervaded by bullying. Bullying is a reality that has been with us for as long we can remember. Others ignore it to consequently avoid being the object of bullying. It is also undeniably present in colleges, universities, workplaces, and organizations.</p><p>To most, bullying is improper or ill conduct —a result of an attitudinal problem. However, when the bully starts to instill fear of physical or emotional harm or damage to property of another student. creates a hostile environment for the victim, or substantially disrupts the education process or orderly operation of the school, then the bully must be subject to disciplinary measures (Section 3(b), Rule II, Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 10627).</p><p>It is interesting to note that the word “bully” was used five hundred years ago as a term of endearment; derived from the Dutch word “boel” for brother, or the German “buhle” for lover.

Life adjustments often come with a wide range of experiences and emotions. Sometimes that transition can feel smooth and other times that journey to the new normal is choppy or downright bumpy!</p><p></p><p>Some people may find themselves in survival mode, gathering information and resources necessary to function at school, work, as a person, and in our relationships with others. Others may be attempting to settle into their new routines. For some, this means trying to combat social isolation. For many, it means learning how to live (or re-live) with friends, family members, partners, or roommates, which is not always easy. I hear a lot of people struggle to find a distraction-free space at home that is conducive to do productive and effective work. For myself, I feel like it takes twice as much time, effort, and energy to do even simple tasks, which can be quite draining. I’ve really had to be very compassionate and patient with myself lately. Others may be struggling with the fatigue, frustration, sadness, anger, grief, and anxiety (among other things) of adjusting. Some people (and I hope there are a lot of you out there), have gone through the adjustment process and are finding comfort in your new norm. In all of this, here are a few important things to remember.</p><p></p><p>Manila, Philippines–Many Filipinos believe that they have adapted to the restrictions and routine of the new normal. However, 94% express worry that they can contract COVID-19 as found in the recent Ipsos Southeast Asia Study (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) on Living with COVID-19. The survey was conducted prior the end of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in Metro Manila over the period of 22nd to 26th May 2020 among 500 Filipinos.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The effects of the COVID-19 panic has caused a massive changes to our daily lives, changes that have often happened rapidly and abruptly.
