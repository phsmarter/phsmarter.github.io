What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)

Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.

Excerpt from an essay written by Kris Gledhill After England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day." Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people. Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method." Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee. So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing. In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included. We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene? Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures." The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal. 1.

AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by
aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 
percent.
Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. “Overtaking on the left” 
appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it 
relates to aggressive driving. “Improper lane change,” ”running stop sign,” 
and “running red light” rank second through four in terms of their 
contribution to fatalities.

                                            A good thesis statement has several qualities: 1. A thesis statement is always framed as a declarative statement. Poor example: What is plagiarism? Improved version: Plagiarism can be explained from cultural and socio-political perspectives. 2. A good thesis statement is focused, meaning it provides supporting points that strengthen the main claim. Poor example: An effective local government unit should have good communication facilities and efficient re- source management programs since these initia- tives will be beneficial for its citizens. Improved version: Effective dissemination of information and effi- cient resource management are indicators of ef- fective local governance. 3. A good thesis statement has clear boundaries. It sets limits as to what the essay intends to explore. Poor example: Guitar playing skills can be improved if the player is dedicated and there are sessions devoted to technique and investments on good equipment must be considered since these will be influential in performing in front of an audience. Improved version: Excellent guitar playing requires countless hours of practice, strategic decisions in purchasing equipment, and tireless dedication.​</a>

                                            Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants?                            Excerpt from an essay written by Kris GledhillAfter England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day" Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people.Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method"Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee.So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing.In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included.We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene?Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures" The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal.1. What is the editorial's main point?2. Is there evidence to back up the main point? Give three examples.3.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a society, everyone has the right to lead his/her life accordingly without any discrimination. When this state is achieved where all individuals are considered to be equal irrespective of their caste, gender, colour, profession, and status, we call it equality. Equality can also be defined as the situation where every individual has the same rights and equal opportunity to grow and prosper.  </p><p>
</p><p>Every individual of society dreams for equal rights and access to resources available at their disposal, but there is a lot of discrimination. This discrimination can be due to cultural differences, geographical differences, the colour of the individual, social status and even gender. The most prevalent discrimination is gender inequality. It is not a localised issue and is limited to only certain spheres of life but is prevalent across the globe. Even in progressive societies and top organisations, we can see many examples of gender bias.  </p><p>

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)

Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.

                            9. C. Open-Ended Questions. Read the essay thoroughly. Then, answer the questions that follow. Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants? Excerpt from an essay written by Kris Gledhill After England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day." Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people. Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method." Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee. So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing. In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included. We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene? Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures." The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal. 1.

</p>1.	What is the editorial’s main point?  <p>The central point of the editorial is to question whether United Kingdom should be accounted for causing the rising of cases and deaths due to COVID19.

<p>a.	UK’s premature lifting of COVID19 protocols

 Circle the letter of the correct answer.
AGRRESIVE DRIVING SHOULD BE AVOIDED
Aggressive driving is a phenomenon, which has only recently got the 
public worried. The National Highway Traffic Society Council (NHTSC) defines 
aggressive driving as the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that 
endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.” Actions such as 
running red lights, improper passing, overtaking on the left, improper lane 
change, failing to yield, improper turns, running stop signs, tailgating, 
careless driving and speeding are examples of aggressive driving. Such actions 
are dangerous to other road users. Aggressive driving should be avoided 
because it causes crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
 The first reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
crashes. According to NHTSC, between 78 percent speed (excessive speed) 
and 100 percent (improper passing) of the cases of aggressive driving resulted 
in traffic crashes and 96 percent of the drivers cited for “ following too closely” 
or tailgating caused crashes as a result of their aggressive driving. Moreover, 
“running red light”, “improper passing”, and “overtaking on the left” topped 
other categories of aggressive driving in contributing to traffic crashes.
 Another reason why aggressive driving should be avoided is it causes 
injuries. NHTSC states that the percentages of the injuries caused by
aggressive driving are in almost all categories of aggressive driving, above 100 
percent.
Aggressive driving also causes fatalities. “Overtaking on the left” 
appears to be the most important contributing factor in traffic facilities as it 
relates to aggressive driving. “Improper lane change,” ”running stop sign,” 
and “running red light” rank second through four in terms of their 
contribution to fatalities.

                            14. A good thesis statement has several qualities: 1. A thesis statement is always framed as a declarative statement. Poor example: What is plagiarism? Improved version: Plagiarism can be explained from cultural and socio-political perspectives. 2. A good thesis statement is focused, meaning it provides supporting points that strengthen the main claim. Poor example: An effective local government unit should have good communication facilities and efficient re- source management programs since these initia- tives will be beneficial for its citizens. Improved version: Effective dissemination of information and effi- cient resource management are indicators of ef- fective local governance. 3. A good thesis statement has clear boundaries. It sets limits as to what the essay intends to explore. Poor example: Guitar playing skills can be improved if the player is dedicated and there are sessions devoted to technique and investments on good equipment must be considered since these will be influential in performing in front of an audience. Improved version: Excellent guitar playing requires countless hours of practice, strategic decisions in purchasing equipment, and tireless dedication.​</h2><br />

                        <p>One example of bias is when a qualified candidate is not hired for a job because of their political beliefs. This is an unfair practice because an applicant's political affiliation should not be a factor when determining their suitability for a job. It is a clear example of political bias.</p><p></p><p>Another example of bias is when an employee is given a higher pay based on their religion. This scenario is an example of religious bias, which can be damaging to company culture and affects the morale of the employees.</p><p></p><p>Prejudice can also manifest in the form of social status-based discrimination. For instance, if students from wealthy families receive better treatment than scholars in a university, it's discrimination based on their socio-economic status. This treatment is unjust and is a form of prejudice against those who do not have the same financial resources.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, students being seated based on their skin color is an example of racial prejudice. This situation is discriminatory as the student's skin color should not be a factor in their seating arrangement.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, discrimination, bias, and prejudice are unprofessional and illegal behaviors that should not be tolerated in any workplace or educational environment. Discrimination in any form should be denounced to ensure that there is equal treatment for everyone, regardless of religion, race, political beliefs, or socioeconomic status.</p><br />

                            22. Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants?                            Excerpt from an essay written by Kris GledhillAfter England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day" Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people.Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method"Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee.So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing.In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included.We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene?Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures" The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal.1. What is the editorial's main point?2. Is there evidence to back up the main point? Give three examples.3.
