                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>Films and Religion: An analysis of Aamir Khan’s PK Abstract Every year, the Indian film industry produces the highest number of films in the world and also figures at the top position for ticket sales, but that does not make the society completely tolerant of how different issues are represented in films. That is a question which PK (2014), the biggest Bollywood grosser of all times, raised. This satirical comedy is based on challenging the superstitions labelled as religious practices in Indian society. India, being home to multiple religions and a diverse cultural fabric, supports many layers of understanding about faith, religion, rituals, and beliefs, which form a sensitive issue. The film delves headfirst into the syncretic melee of different faiths in India and it takes direct aim at ‘godmen’, the guru figures who direct the followers towards following symbols of religion. Hindu groups have been considering it as a blasphemy against Hindu gods and gurus, because of which the film has had to plunge into controversies. There have been protests and attacks. A ‘boycott-PK’ movement as well as a parallel ‘Support-PK’ trend have been seen in the real as well as virtual world. It becomes all the more interesting to see the depiction of religion in this film, using strong narratives along with visual representations to deal with the issue of faith. Also, the timing of the film coincided with the prevailing atmosphere of religious intolerance within India. The series of events regarding religion in the Indian society lend a meaning to a study on this film as a mediated reality of Indian society. The study will conduct a qualitative analysis of the film and present a reading of this popular media form.

                            21. Gave me an ESSAY about the topic Religion   what different values have your religion instilled in you? including the INTRODUCTION,BODY,and CONCLUTION? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Being religious is a choice, it’s a life style. In a way being religious is also having freedom. You have the freedom to do and pray to who ever you want and worship and be apart of any religion. It’s your choice and nobody can take that choice from you.  Religion is freedom and everybody is entitled to their own beliefs.</p><p></p><p>If I was approached by a person of a different religion then my own and they asked me “why do you worship Mary and the saints?” I would reply “We do not worship Mary and the saints we ask them to help us pray to God for what ever we need and for what ever problem we need help with. When we ask the saints to intercede for us it really means to help us pray to God. For example it’s like you have a problem in life and you need God to help you out. It’s like you ask your friend if they could also pray to God that you find a solution to your problem. So we do not worship Mary and the saints we just ask them to help us pray to God.</p><p></p><p>It is good to pray to God directly if you want to. If its something personal and you do not want anybody to know your problems its fine, it’s no big deal. But God will hear you more and answer your prayers faster if you have like a group or just more than one person praying for you. It doesn’t hurt to have people pray for you and it doesn’t hurt to ask people to pray for you. The more people that pray for you the better your solution will be.</p><p></p><p>The reason why we go through the intercession of saints is because it doesn’t hurt to ask for help it actually makes it better to get help. The saints all have their stories about the hardships in their life’s and the good works they performed. These saints know what you are going through. For example St. Peregrine is the patron saint of cancer patients. St. Peregrine had an incurable cancer in his leg. He was then miraculously healed by God</p><br />

                            23. what various guiding principles which may have been influenced by your religion do you adhere to your life? essay</h2><br />
                        <p>I would like to share to you several guiding principles which may have been influenced by my religion that I adhere to my life. Some of these principles are about love and the after life.  </p><p>Love is one of the greatest teachings of a Roman Catholic church. It's greatest form is how God the Father sent Jesus, his son to the world to be an example and representation of his love. He let his only son to come down here on earth, be born as a man in flesh and experience and do things like a human being. He can starve, hurt, experienced pain and death. We know his story and sufferings. We even heard some of his teachings and miracles. God sent him to us because he wants us to see and witness the real unconditional love. Even though it only means sufferings, Jesus and God agree to this idea if it only means to make us believe in their love.
</p><p>Another idea which I highly accepted from the Catholic church is the idea of the after life. There is a place for people who has their earthly body died. After their life here on earth, their body will be travelling in spirit to face Jesus for the Final Judgement. Of course nobody is born without being sinned. His body will undergo a cleansing process in Purgatory wherein he must pray for his sins and ask for redemption. It would be a great help for his soul's forgiveness if his living persons would also pray for him.  </p><p>Catholic principles are not that complicated and hard to understand. It is realistic and almost everything is supported by the bible, Saints and the church.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The indigenous beliefs and folk religions of the indigenous people in the Philippines have played a significant role in preserving their cultural identities throughout history. Despite the influx of foreign influences, these beliefs and religions have remained deeply ingrained in the daily lives of the indigenous communities.</p><p></p><p>The indigenous people of the Philippines have a wide array of beliefs and practices that are unique to their respective ethnic groups. These include animism, ancestor worship, and belief in various spirits and deities. These beliefs are often deeply connected to their environment and the natural world, with many indigenous communities believing that everything in nature has a spiritual essence.</p><p></p><p>One of the most notable examples of indigenous beliefs in the Philippines is the animistic belief system of the Lumad people, who believe in the existence of various spirits, including the spirits of the land, sea, and sky. These spirits are believed to have the power to influence the lives of the Lumad people, and are honored through offerings and rituals.</p><p></p><p>Ancestor worship is also a common practice among many indigenous communities in the Philippines, with many indigenous people believing that their ancestors can influence their lives from beyond the grave. This belief is often connected to the concept of the afterlife, with the indigenous people believing that the souls of the dead can continue to influence the lives of the living.</p><p></p><p>Despite the influence of foreign religions, such as Christianity and Islam, many indigenous communities have managed to preserve their traditional beliefs and practices. This is due in part to the remote locations of many indigenous communities, as well as their strong sense of community and cultural identity.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the indigenous beliefs and folk religions of the indigenous people in the Philippines are an integral part of their cultural heritage. Despite the influences of foreign cultures, these beliefs and religions have been kept preserved through the generations, providing the indigenous people with a sense of identity and connection to their ancestors and the natural world.</p><br />

                        <p> </p><p>Religion means the belief that I am believing. Not only belief but also religion is the place where in I am learning and gaining lots of knowledge about God,Jesus,and the bible. Perhaps there are more than one religion that had spread throughout the century which is I respect but also I extremely dispute for a reason such as the wrong things that they teach about the bible that can mislead people also their greediness that most of them use religion or God merely to collect money from people. Additionaly, religion also means the place where I feel comfortable,happy,and faithful, it is the place I can feel that God is always by my side and always there to protect,help,and bless me. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, religion is one of the most important place where in I could praise and communicate with God. Through my prayers I thank our mighty father for everything he had given to me; he's love and kindness,blessings,and staying by my side all the time especially when I need him the most. Lastly, religion does matter so much to me because it is all about the God I believe and worship until I die.</p><p> </p><p></p><br />
