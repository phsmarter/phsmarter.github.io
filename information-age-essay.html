Please be guided by the rubric The Philippine government has been relatively successful in doing initiatives for the implementation of laws that look after the welfare of senior citizens. However , with the current COVID-19 crisis, there resurfaced unspoken issues that led to exacerbation of the conditions of vulnerable groups of the society including the aged group Many working senior citizens, especially those from the poor segment were estimated to have been deprved of their income because of the COVID-19. A result from the 2018 Longitudinal Study of Ageing and Health in the Philippines showed that 46 percent of the senior citizen population lives below the poverty line. The gender lens further disclosed that 57 percent of the men work as compared to 39 percent of the women within this aged group. Moreover, while 42 percent of the senior citizens have a pension, only half declared pension as their most essential income source with comparable levels for both men and women (Cruz et al., 2018). When translating these data to the current situation, it is evident that especially the very poor and women senior citizens would most likely be affected. Furthermore, there were also issues of senior citizens suffering from a scarcity of food and medicine as they lingered indoors during the COVID-19 quarantine. While the crisis administrators develop policies to address the basic needs of senior citizens, a substantial number of this vulnerable group has been barely surviving in circumstances made more unendurable by the quarantine (Binay, 2020) This condition is reflected in the words of a senior citizen who expressed in a media interview that since the quarantine, the government has offered not enough assistance. She mentioned needs such as medicines and face masks which she cannot afford. There were also instances when quarantine guidelines are unclear and caused confusion, making access to food and other basic commodities even more difficult (Paul, 2020). This challenging situation of senior citizens during the COVID-19 crisis is compounded by the inadequacy of living space for physical distancing Perez (2020) of the Commission on Population and Development analyzed the living space Filipinos have and whether physical distancing is possible. Basing on the statistics, it was found out that a​</a>

Formulate your synthesis and apply your knowledge on organizing sources. Be guided by the rubric. With the rise of smartphone technology, many parents are letting their children use their smartphones. While it may seem to be harmless, the benefits of letting children use smartphones can be argued. Smartphones can have an impact on a child's development. Children should not have smartphones due to the impact they have on a child's development. Before smartphones, what did children do for fun? Kids used to spend their free time playing outdoors with their friends. This is where children learned to interact with others. They made friends, and used their imagination to have fun. Children didn't require devices to stay entertained, they had to have fun with others. With the availability of smartphones, children are becoming familiar with them at a very early age. This leads parents to feel like they can cause their children to have social problems by using the devices too much or to be harassed for not using smart devices. This leaves some parents in between a rock and a hard place. (Craig) Smartphones prohibit children from socially interacting. Children who use their parent's smartphones for playing games miss out on opportunities to interact with others. Children can become addicted to the games, this can cause problems later in life when they need social skills. According to an article by Nina Pilapil, games that are designed for kids can keep them from social interaction Parents should limit their children's time spent on a smartphone and encourage them to play with friends instead. While exposure to smartphones is not necessarily a bad thing in small doses, it should be limited and monitored. (Pilapil) Children are becoming more obese. This is caused in part by a lack of physical activity. Smartphones are too great. Children will have less social interaction and more health and development problems when they use smartphones in excess. Children should not have smartphones due to the impact smartphones on a child's development. At first, I'm thinking that using phones​</a>

                                            Identify the writing techniques used in the following informative essays
below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</a>

Then, write an essay (2-3 paragraphs) discussing the issues presented. You may include factual information to support your ideas. Please be guided by the rubric The Philippine government has been relatively successful in doing initiatives for the implementation of laws that look after the welfare of senior citizens. However , with the current COVID-19 crisis, there resurfaced unspoken issues that led to exacerbation of the conditions of vulnerable groups of the society including the aged group Many working senior citizens, especially those from the poor segment were estimated to have been deprved of their income because of the COVID-19. A result from the 2018 Longitudinal Study of Ageing and Health in the Philippines showed that 46 percent of the senior citizen population lives below the poverty line. The gender lens further disclosed that 57 percent of the men work as compared to 39 percent of the women within this aged group. Moreover, while 42 percent of the senior citizens have a pension, only half declared pension as their most essential income source with comparable levels for both men and women (Cruz et al., 2018). When translating these data to the current situation, it is evident that especially the very poor and women senior citizens would most likely be affected. Furthermore, there were also issues of senior citizens suffering from a scarcity of food and medicine as they lingered indoors during the COVID-19 quarantine. While the crisis administrators develop policies to address the basic needs of senior citizens, a substantial number of this vulnerable group has been barely surviving in circumstances made more unendurable by the quarantine (Binay, 2020) This condition is reflected in the words of a senior citizen who expressed in a media interview that since the quarantine, the government has offered not enough assistance. She mentioned needs such as medicines and face masks which she cannot afford. There were also instances when quarantine guidelines are unclear and caused confusion, making access to food and other basic commodities even more difficult (Paul, 2020). This challenging situation of senior citizens during the COVID-19 crisis is compounded by the inadequacy of living space for physical distancing Perez (2020) of the Commission on Population and Development analyzed the living space Filipinos have and whether physical distancing is possible. Basing on the statistics, it was found out that a​</h2><br />

                            13. Instructions: Read the essay, Children Should Not Use Smartphones Excessively, and find other information about it. Formulate your synthesis and apply your knowledge on organizing sources. Be guided by the rubric. With the rise of smartphone technology, many parents are letting their children use their smartphones. While it may seem to be harmless, the benefits of letting children use smartphones can be argued. Smartphones can have an impact on a child's development. Children should not have smartphones due to the impact they have on a child's development. Before smartphones, what did children do for fun? Kids used to spend their free time playing outdoors with their friends. This is where children learned to interact with others. They made friends, and used their imagination to have fun. Children didn't require devices to stay entertained, they had to have fun with others. With the availability of smartphones, children are becoming familiar with them at a very early age. This leads parents to feel like they can cause their children to have social problems by using the devices too much or to be harassed for not using smart devices. This leaves some parents in between a rock and a hard place. (Craig) Smartphones prohibit children from socially interacting. Children who use their parent's smartphones for playing games miss out on opportunities to interact with others. Children can become addicted to the games, this can cause problems later in life when they need social skills. According to an article by Nina Pilapil, games that are designed for kids can keep them from social interaction Parents should limit their children's time spent on a smartphone and encourage them to play with friends instead. While exposure to smartphones is not necessarily a bad thing in small doses, it should be limited and monitored. (Pilapil) Children are becoming more obese. This is caused in part by a lack of physical activity. Smartphones are too great. Children will have less social interaction and more health and development problems when they use smartphones in excess. Children should not have smartphones due to the impact smartphones on a child's development. At first, I'm thinking that using phones​</h2><br />

                            14. Identify the writing techniques used in the following informative essays
below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</h2><br />
