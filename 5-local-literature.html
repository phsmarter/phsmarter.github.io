                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Existing Literature:</p><p>There are very few studies that have explored the factors that influence the choice of senior high school tracks among grade 10 students. However, some studies have investigated the various factors that affect educational and career decisions of high school students, such as parental influence, academic performance, personal interests, and socioeconomic status.</p><p></p><p>2. Relevance to Local/Global Context:</p><p>The study is relevant both locally and globally. Senior high school is a significant educational milestone that shapes the future of students. Understanding the factors that affect the choice of senior high school tracks among grade 10 students is imperative for developing effective educational policies and programs that cater to the students' needs and aspirations. Similar studies in other countries may also provide valuable insights into the factors influencing high school students' educational decision-making.</p><p></p><p>3. Critical Background or Contextual Information:</p><p>The Philippines K-12 program mandates the implementation of senior high school starting from grade 11. Students are required to choose from three tracks - academic, technical-vocational livelihood, and sports and arts - and several strands based on their career aspirations and interests. The correct choice of strand is crucial as it determines their career path and prospects for higher education. Despite the significance of this decision, there is a lack of research investigating the factors that influence grade 10 students' choice of senior high school tracks.</p><p></p><p>4. Research Gap:</p><p>There is a need for research that specifically examines the factors that affect grade 10 students' decision-making in choosing their senior high school tracks. Although several studies have explored the educational and career decision-making of high school students, there are very few studies that investigate the factors that influence senior high school track choices among grade 10 students.</p><p></p><p>5. Proof of Urgency Research Goal/Objective:</p><p>The study's primary objective is to evaluate the factors that affect grade 10 students' decision-making in choosing their senior high school tracks in Cauayan City National High School (Main). This research is urgent as the Filipino education system's current reform mandates that more students should continue their education up to the senior high school level. By evaluating the factors that affect senior high school track choice, educational institutions can develop programs that assist students in making informed decisions about their education and career.</p><br />
