Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Since 1990s STEM is a term used to refer education policies to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. But is much more, because it has implications for workforce development, teaching frameworks, industries, no formal education, etc. Is a term which also involves the equity of a country and some challenges like the gender gap.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Art education is crucial for the children's development. Many school boards feel that art education is not a necessity and not very important in the lives of today's students. Art classes are constantly compared to the main core classes, such as math and English. Many people feel that core classes are much more valuable to a child's education, which is why art may be cut first from schools if there is low funding. Art classes offer children critical lessons about life that they are not exposed to in any of the other classes. Art teachers drive the creativity and the imagination of students, while allowing students to express themselves.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>ARGUMENTATIVE TEXT<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Text types in writing structure the fundamental styles of composing. Authentic texts only try to illuminate, while abstract texts try to engage or in any case draw in the peruser by utilizing innovative language and symbolism. There are numerous angles to artistic composition, and numerous ways of breaking down it, however four essential classes are engaging, account, interpretive, and <strong>argumentative.</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>In view of the assessment and the ensuing abstract judgment in response to an issue. <strong>Argumentative </strong>alludes to the reasons progressed possibly in support of a matter. The essayist normally contends with one more side to persuade the peruser to join a specific side. A contention text is a text where the author is either 'possibly in support of' an issue or subject, or presents the case for the two sides. A typical illustration of a contention text a child might expound on in grade school is whether understudies ought to need to wear school regalia. <strong>Argumentative</strong> text alludes to text that takes a situation about a thought or subject. The position can be possibly in support of a thought, and the creator of the text will uphold their situation with broad proof.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Earth's lithosphere is a cracked planetary shell floating on a dense, liquid mantle. These cracks are that fault lines that we have today and the pieces of the shell are what we call tectonic plates. There are two major factors that results to the movement of the lithosphere: The instability of the mantle as materials of different density are interacting with each other, and the difference in density of the tectonic plates. As the mantle below moves, <strong>plates above are also forced to move along with it, causing earthquakes</strong>.</p><p>The case of differential density between tectonic plates is illustrated by the <strong>formation of the Himalayas mountain range</strong> and why the highest peaks on the planet, including Mt Everest, are located in the area. As the instability of the mantle below drives the denser Indo-Australian plate against the relatively lighter Eurasian plate. This results to the buckling of both plates, with the  Indo-Australian plate going under and pushing the Eurasian plate upwards, resulting growth of Himalayas at more than 1cm per year. This collision not only produce the beautiful Himalayas, but it also responsible for the creation of the Tibetan plateau and consequently  contributed to the desertification of the Taklamakan desert, while the rising moisture from the Indian ocean along the ridge of the Himalayas contributes to the formation of monsoons.</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><br />
