                                            ENHANCEMENT ACTIVITY I. Maria is planning to open up a Cafeteria near her house. She closed her previous Cafeteria few months ago because the rental keeps getting higher and the income is declining because of the pandemic. It came up to her the idea to open again since a lot of people are asking for online delivery of their favorite snacks offered in her shop since most of the people would stay at home and would prefer food delivered in their doorsteps. Since she owned a vacant lot near her house, and she thought that re-opening her shop in that location would be a great idea and she will not pay rentals anymore. And her Café Services will still continue but with the added services like the Food Panda does.

She closed her previous Cafeteria few months ago because the rental keeps getting higher and the income is declining because of the pandemic. It came up to her the idea to open again since a lot of people are asking for online delivery of their favorite snacks offered in her shop since most of the people would stay at home and would prefer food delivered in their doorsteps. Since she owned a vacant lot near her house, and she thought that re-opening her shop in that location would be a great idea and she will not pay rentals anymore. And her Café Services will still continue but with the added services like the Food Panda does.
