                                            Directions: Read the editorial article and answer the questions that follow. No Smoking Please People should stop smoking. It seems that no matter how many have died because of lung or throat cancer, people still smoke. In the Philippines alone, according to Tobacco Atlas, there are more than 117, 700 of its people are killed by tobacco-caused disease. This is a cause for concern. So, if they can't be stopped from smoking, what should be done to reduce the impact of smoking? One of the few things that can be done is to assign a smoking area in the city. In Davao City for example, people are not allowed to smoke anywhere. There is a designated place where people can smoke for as long as they want. Anyone who is seen smoking in a non-smoking area, receives an equivalent punishment. Another solution is to make the enforcement of the law regarding smoking prohibition in the city much stricter than ever. However, this requires more work as CCTV's need to be installed and more people are needed for monitoring. Increase the prices of cigarettes by increasing the tobacco tax. People keep on smoking because of the relatively cheap price imposed by the government. If only cigarettes are as expensive as wines, then people would only smoke occasionally. It is understandable that the tobacco business will be affected, but the health of the people is more important. It seems that the problem about smoking is far more complex than it appears. And because people can't be stopped from smoking, the impact can be reduced by regulating both the usage and the price.  1.How did the writer introduce the main idea? 2.

                            5. Directions: Read the editorial article and answer the questions that follow. No Smoking Please People should stop smoking. It seems that no matter how many have died because of lung or throat cancer, people still smoke. In the Philippines alone, according to Tobacco Atlas, there are more than 117, 700 of its people are killed by tobacco-caused disease. This is a cause for concern. So, if they can't be stopped from smoking, what should be done to reduce the impact of smoking? One of the few things that can be done is to assign a smoking area in the city. In Davao City for example, people are not allowed to smoke anywhere. There is a designated place where people can smoke for as long as they want. Anyone who is seen smoking in a non-smoking area, receives an equivalent punishment. Another solution is to make the enforcement of the law regarding smoking prohibition in the city much stricter than ever. However, this requires more work as CCTV's need to be installed and more people are needed for monitoring. Increase the prices of cigarettes by increasing the tobacco tax. People keep on smoking because of the relatively cheap price imposed by the government. If only cigarettes are as expensive as wines, then people would only smoke occasionally. It is understandable that the tobacco business will be affected, but the health of the people is more important. It seems that the problem about smoking is far more complex than it appears. And because people can't be stopped from smoking, the impact can be reduced by regulating both the usage and the price.  1.How did the writer introduce the main idea? 2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Counterclaim: While smoking is a known risk factor for lung cancer, not all smokers develop lung cancer, and not all lung cancer cases are caused by smoking. </p><p>Counterclaim: Walking can be a safe and effective form of exercise for many people, but it may not be appropriate or safe for everyone. Some individuals with certain medical conditions or mobility issues may need to avoid or modify walking exercises. </p><p>Counterclaim: A low-calorie deficit diet can be effective for weight loss and improving overall health when implemented properly and combined with other healthy lifestyle choices, such as exercise and stress management. </p><p>Counterclaim: While students may have the right to express themselves through their appearance, schools have the responsibility to create a safe and respectful learning environment for all students. Allowing students to color their hair any color they want may cause distractions and disruptions in the classroom, and may not be consistent with the school's dress code policies.</p><p>Counterclaim: The death penalty is a controversial and complex issue that raises ethical, legal, and human rights concerns. While the death penalty may be seen as a form of justice and a deterrent to crime, there is evidence to suggest that it is not an effective or fair means of addressing crime. </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
