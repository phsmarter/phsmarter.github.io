                                            Discussion: This project has focused on a set of community-based irrigation systems known as acequias that have resided in the Taos valley of New Mexico for several hundred years (see figure A4.1). There are two research questions that have guided this project. The first one asks about the conditions that have enabled the farmers to maintain the collective-action needed to sustain themselves in the face of drought and resource scarcity for several hundred years. Collective-action is a very common outcome examined by ESS scholars, as it plays a large role in affecting whether an environmental commons is maintained or not. The second question focuses on the resilience, or vulnerability, of the acequias to a suite of modern disturbances that have largely resulted from increased economic growth and integration in their region. Many resource using communities that have persisted for centuries are struggling to adapt to modern economic conditions. The research design adopted for this project is identified as an embedded case study. The first table summarizes the units of analysis that are involved in this project and the analytical strategies applied to each. At the top we have the case itself, which includes all 51 acequias in Taos valley. At this level the analytical strategy applied is the development of a qualitative model describing of the patterns of interactions among various groups of farmers both within and between acequia communities (Cox 2014b). This qualitative model involves an application of the social-ecological framework by Ostrom (2007). Additionally, the project involved a statistical analysis to examine differences across acequias in a vegetation index measured by a series of Landsat images over time (Cox and Ross 2011). Finally, Cox (2014c) examined data from a survey of 107 acequia members, and conducted a statistical analysis of groups of acequias over time. For this final analysis, seven acequia groups were constructed based on the main rivers that fed each set of acequias in the valley, and the unit of analysis is in fact an acequia group-year, with measurements taken at each year for seven groups of acequias. The final table relates each of the units of analysis from the previous table to the units of observation/data sources that were used to measure important features of these units, and the sampling methods for these sources. Without delving into each of the data sources, it is important to note that, for each unit of analysis, multiple data sources are used. This is common in ESS. Combining the information in the two tables reveals a basic structure that relates the most important elements of a research project: a given project has (1) one or more research questions, (2) a research design, (3) one or more units of analysis, each of which is analyzed with an (4) analytical strategy, and of each which is measured with (5) one or more data sources, each of which in turn is obtained through a particular (6) sampling method.​</a>

Statistics is a scientific body of knowledge which deals with the collection, organization. presentation, interpretation, and analysis of data. The study of statistics is important because society frequently organizes and expresses data numerically. We are exposed to statistics every day from weather predictions, newspaper ads, election results, surveys, etc. Statistics is used in business to observe patterns and behaviors of sales, forecast trends, and project future economic activity.

                                            Cardiovascular disease is now among the leading causes of death in Africa as the numbers keep getting higher. This is a cause for worry as hypertension and related diseases not only affect the health of the general public, but also impact negatively on economic growth as people become sick and unable to work or die leaving their families in poverty. Africa can succeed in the fight against hypertension if there are sustainable and effective best practices as well as community-based programs that encourage both early screening and treatment of hypertension. There needs to be a concerted effort to educate the masses about hypertension, what causes it and how to prevent or treat the disease. Prevention and control of hypertension in Africa requires formulation of policies and careful implementation via a multi-sectoral model and close cooperation that brings together government bodies as well as other stakeholders in the health industry. As we celebrate the gains the continent has achieved, it is important to ensure that diseases such as hypertension are kept at bay. It is time for Africans to realize that times have changed and lifestyle diseases are here with us. Experts encourage people to eat healthy foods, exercise regularly, and avoid stress as some of the simple measures that can help to keep hypertension at bay.

The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, which triggered a global pandemic at a confounding pace has affected the whole world. Following the emergence of the novel coronavirus and its spread outside China, countries like the Philippines are experiencing the deadly virus’ life-threatening and chilling socio-economic impacts. From the first three imported COVID-19 cases in January, the infection rate in the Philippines has grown rapidly because of localized transmissions totaling 15,588 cases with 11,069 active cases as of 28 May, 2020. There have been 921 deaths and 3,598 recoveries so far. Among all ASEAN member states, the Philippines occupies third spot in terms of the highest number of COVID-19 cases. In the world, out of the 215 countries affected by the pandemic, the Philippines is placed 43rd as of 28 May, 2020, according to World meter, a reference website that provides counters and real-time statistics on diverse topics.  In response to the outbreak, the government of the Philippine launched a multi-sectorial response to the COVID-19 pandemic through its Interagency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases chaired by the Department of Health (DOH). For almost three months now, the Philippine government has adopted a suppression strategy through the use of non-pharmaceutical health (NPH) measures (i.e. social distancing, wearing of face masks, quarantines, etc.) to control the spread of the virus in the country. These measures are embodied in the Philippine Government’s National Action Plan (NAP) Against COVID-19 strategic framework, which includes strategies such as TASK FORCE T3 (Test, Trace and Treat) and PDITRA or Prevention, Detection, Isolation, Reintegration, and Adopting the New Normal Program. ( NASA PIC.

                            18. Discussion: This project has focused on a set of community-based irrigation systems known as acequias that have resided in the Taos valley of New Mexico for several hundred years (see figure A4.1). There are two research questions that have guided this project. The first one asks about the conditions that have enabled the farmers to maintain the collective-action needed to sustain themselves in the face of drought and resource scarcity for several hundred years. Collective-action is a very common outcome examined by ESS scholars, as it plays a large role in affecting whether an environmental commons is maintained or not. The second question focuses on the resilience, or vulnerability, of the acequias to a suite of modern disturbances that have largely resulted from increased economic growth and integration in their region. Many resource using communities that have persisted for centuries are struggling to adapt to modern economic conditions. The research design adopted for this project is identified as an embedded case study. The first table summarizes the units of analysis that are involved in this project and the analytical strategies applied to each. At the top we have the case itself, which includes all 51 acequias in Taos valley. At this level the analytical strategy applied is the development of a qualitative model describing of the patterns of interactions among various groups of farmers both within and between acequia communities (Cox 2014b). This qualitative model involves an application of the social-ecological framework by Ostrom (2007). Additionally, the project involved a statistical analysis to examine differences across acequias in a vegetation index measured by a series of Landsat images over time (Cox and Ross 2011). Finally, Cox (2014c) examined data from a survey of 107 acequia members, and conducted a statistical analysis of groups of acequias over time. For this final analysis, seven acequia groups were constructed based on the main rivers that fed each set of acequias in the valley, and the unit of analysis is in fact an acequia group-year, with measurements taken at each year for seven groups of acequias. The final table relates each of the units of analysis from the previous table to the units of observation/data sources that were used to measure important features of these units, and the sampling methods for these sources. Without delving into each of the data sources, it is important to note that, for each unit of analysis, multiple data sources are used. This is common in ESS. Combining the information in the two tables reveals a basic structure that relates the most important elements of a research project: a given project has (1) one or more research questions, (2) a research design, (3) one or more units of analysis, each of which is analyzed with an (4) analytical strategy, and of each which is measured with (5) one or more data sources, each of which in turn is obtained through a particular (6) sampling method.​</h2><br />

Statistics is a scientific body of knowledge which deals with the collection, organization. presentation, interpretation, and analysis of data. The study of statistics is important because society frequently organizes and expresses data numerically. We are exposed to statistics every day from weather predictions, newspaper ads, election results, surveys, etc. Statistics is used in business to observe patterns and behaviors of sales, forecast trends, and project future economic activity.

                            22. Cardiovascular disease is now among the leading causes of death in Africa as the numbers keep getting higher. This is a cause for worry as hypertension and related diseases not only affect the health of the general public, but also impact negatively on economic growth as people become sick and unable to work or die leaving their families in poverty. Africa can succeed in the fight against hypertension if there are sustainable and effective best practices as well as community-based programs that encourage both early screening and treatment of hypertension. There needs to be a concerted effort to educate the masses about hypertension, what causes it and how to prevent or treat the disease. Prevention and control of hypertension in Africa requires formulation of policies and careful implementation via a multi-sectoral model and close cooperation that brings together government bodies as well as other stakeholders in the health industry. As we celebrate the gains the continent has achieved, it is important to ensure that diseases such as hypertension are kept at bay. It is time for Africans to realize that times have changed and lifestyle diseases are here with us. Experts encourage people to eat healthy foods, exercise regularly, and avoid stress as some of the simple measures that can help to keep hypertension at bay.

The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, which triggered a global pandemic at a confounding pace has affected the whole world. Following the emergence of the novel coronavirus and its spread outside China, countries like the Philippines are experiencing the deadly virus’ life-threatening and chilling socio-economic impacts. From the first three imported COVID-19 cases in January, the infection rate in the Philippines has grown rapidly because of localized transmissions totaling 15,588 cases with 11,069 active cases as of 28 May, 2020. There have been 921 deaths and 3,598 recoveries so far. Among all ASEAN member states, the Philippines occupies third spot in terms of the highest number of COVID-19 cases. In the world, out of the 215 countries affected by the pandemic, the Philippines is placed 43rd as of 28 May, 2020, according to World meter, a reference website that provides counters and real-time statistics on diverse topics.  In response to the outbreak, the government of the Philippine launched a multi-sectorial response to the COVID-19 pandemic through its Interagency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases chaired by the Department of Health (DOH). For almost three months now, the Philippine government has adopted a suppression strategy through the use of non-pharmaceutical health (NPH) measures (i.e. social distancing, wearing of face masks, quarantines, etc.) to control the spread of the virus in the country. These measures are embodied in the Philippine Government’s National Action Plan (NAP) Against COVID-19 strategic framework, which includes strategies such as TASK FORCE T3 (Test, Trace and Treat) and PDITRA or Prevention, Detection, Isolation, Reintegration, and Adopting the New Normal Program. ( NASA PIC.
