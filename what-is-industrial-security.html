                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Industrial control systems (ICS) are not only complex, they are also critical to the operation of industrial infrastructure. They form a link between digital and physical components, and interpret the commands which control your installation. And such a key role carries with it a strong need for risk management. Drawing on our clients' and our own experience, here is a list of the 9 most commonly-encountered issues. And – most importantly – how we deal with them!And such a stoppage can compromise the installation, destroy productivity and even cause more serious problems (environmental impacts or human risks). For example, in a foundry, imagine a vat filled with molten metal falling below the required temperature, causing its contents to solidify; the entire unit would then have to be destroyed and the installation replaced in full. Or in a transportation context, imagine a train passing a defective signal which sends it in the wrong direction.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pwera nalang kung taga north korea ka haha</p><br />
