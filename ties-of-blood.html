                        It's family by Burgess and Locke. <p></p>Filipino Family: <p>A Filipino family is one that comes from the Philippines. Filipino families have Filipino customs, traits, and values, with family closeness being the most important value.</p><p></p>How a Filipino family is put together<p>The typical Filipino family is made up of a <strong>husband, a wife, and their children.</strong> Sometimes grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins are also part of the family. When godparents are chosen for a child, this circle is often made bigger. Father, mother, and children make up a nuclear family.</p><p></p>FatherEveryone agrees that the father is the head of the family. The father is in charge of the whole family.<p></p>MotherThe mother, on the other hand, is called the "ilaw ng tahanan," which means "the law of the home." She is in charge of cleaning the house, taking care of the kids, making meal plans, and putting the family's money into a budget.<p></p>ChildA child's role may change depending on whether he or she is the oldest, the middle, the youngest, or the only child. The oldest helps his mom take care of his younger siblings. • The middle child may take on the role of the oldest child. The youngest child is often the most loved, but he or she is also expected to do some of the housework. Parents always take care of the youngest child the best.<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Learn more about neighborhood here: https://brainly.ph/question/9863809</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ6</p><br />
