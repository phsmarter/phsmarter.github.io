                            1. Lesson 7 Problem Solution What is It A problem/solution essay presents a problem, usually discussing several aspects of the problem, then concludes by discussing solutions to the problem. The problem may be addressed in the following ways: Effects only Describe the problem only in terms of its effects [ Use examples. Causes and effects Outline the causes of the problem. Discuss solutions in terms of preventive measures. Extended example I After a topic sentence, illustrate the problem by using an extended example (through a story or an anecdote from your introduction).​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Problem-solution essays are a common essay type, especially for short essays such as subject exams or IELTS. The page gives information on what they are, how to structure this type of essay, and gives an example problem-solution essay on the topic of obesity and fitness levels.</p><p></p><p>Problem-solution essays consider the problems of a particular situation, and give solutions to those problems. They are in some ways similar to cause and effect essays, especially in terms of structure (see below). Problem-solution essays are actually a sub-type of another type of essay, which has the following four components:</p><p></p><p>Situation</p><p>Problem</p><p>Solution</p><p>Evaluation</p><p></p><p>The 'situation' may be included in the essay prompt, in which case it will not be needed in the main body. If it is needed, it can often be included in the introduction, especially for short essays, as with the example essay below. The 'evaluation' may be included as part of the conclusion (also as in the example below), or omitted altogether, especially for short essays. For these reasons, problem-solution essays are more common than situation-problem-solution-evaluation essays (or SPSE essays).</p><br />
