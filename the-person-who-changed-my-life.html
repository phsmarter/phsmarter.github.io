Dear Jen, Forgive me if I failed to be a good mother. Forgive me if I failed to make you my princess and to stand beside you like a queen. Sorry, if I failed you. My dear Jen, I never had an education. My parents believed that I was not worthy to be sent to school, that I was better off as a housemaid. I only learned to read and to write when your Papa taught me. He was the only person in my life who supported and believed in me. Life has been so unfair to me. Every- thing does not seem to fall in proper places. Life and people were so hard on me, that is why I find it hard to trust people easily. I knew that I would come to this point, and forgive me if I could not tum my fate around. This is it Promise me, my dear Jen, that you will change the course of your fate. The road that I took was rough and hard, but that does not mean that you will take the same route. I may leave you physically, but I will always be with you in all your journeys.

A - First Person B - Second Person C. Third Person Objective D - Third Person Limited E - Third Person Omniscient 1. I sought Tatay's mind about the Baracuda and he said, “They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. "Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" | nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, “ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's “You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their slout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "Ilaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed. 3. While gulping their favorite drinks, people would gather because they would brag about their encounters with the Baracuda in the outskirts of the neighboring towns. They talked about combat tactics, death and victories. There was one thing that struck us most: the dried dark things the men took as hors d'oeuvres, which they claimed as ears and manhood of the enemies they encountered. To my young mind, that was excessively brutal and that scared me to even gaze at them both: the llaga and the Baracuda. 4. One afternoon, after dismissal time in school, I saw Nanay along with a number of parents rushing to meet us children at the school gate. They appeared frightened as they told the teachers that droves of Baracuda in vehicles were aiming their guns at people they passed by; hence, they were afraid the Baracuda would hurt the school children on their way home - the very reason they were fetching them. 5. Every day the Baracuda passed by either marching or riding in dirty-looking vehicles At that time, they did not hurt anybody from Baroy; however, we heard news that the bodyguard of the governor got killed in an encounter. This drastically changed the picture of the highway. People from the remote mountains came down in their karomata (cart pulled by a carabao), filled with hungry-looking crying children, possessions in sacks, while tugging along domestic animals such as goals, pigs, dogs, etc. They were the evacuees who sought immediate refuge across Panguil Bay - to the province of Misamis Occidental and the cities of Tangub, Ozamiz, and Oroquieta vla rented pump boats from the coasts of Baroy and Tubod.​</a>

Better pay, higher position - these did not even come to mind. I prayed for direction. No position in other companies was open and no job offer came. For a year, I tried to be patient. A time came when I was no longer sad. I had accepted my place and found joy in little things. No doubt I still wanted a new job, but there was faith and assurance that God would fulfill his purpose for me and his will would be done. Soon enough, I received not one but two job offers! Trough the whole year waiting experience, I found that I became stronger and learned more about Jesus and myself. Had this been the old me, I would have just been irritated and impatient and resigned. I would have been angry and negative. But in Jesus, the former things have come. "Anxious," "weak" come be turned to "trusting", "being patient." Just goes to show that the Lord really does change our attitude in life. Answer the following questions: 1.

                                            Do not envy those people who were born great but rather, make yourself great through hardwork. Perhaps, we all grow through the process. Just like the flower, it needs proper care, right amount of water until it grows and becomes a beautiful flower that everyone will admire it. And you, you are like a flower who grows every single day of your life. You are like an art that even it is not colourful and it is just simple, you can still call it a masterpiece. You are flawed by design, your imperfections is what makes you perfect. You deserve all the love and not to be swathe by dilemmas, that even though you were destructed by many, loving yourself is still eternity.I used to envy someone people for the fact that they have the things that I want. Will they call me plagiarist for the fact that I am trying to copy them because all people love them? Will they sue me for committing mistake and that is to hate someone because of too much envious of that person? Because of toxic high standards in our society I became someone that isn’t really me. And I realized something, as I keep on growing each day, starting to comprehend things everyday. I realized that—Never let their wordsmakes you doubt aboutyourself and change you.Never let their glancemakes you scared of them.Never let them take offyour self-confidence.And never let them controlyour decisions in life.“Do not change yourself for others and let others change for you. You don't need to adjust yourself just to fit yourself with them.”Today, I woke up loving thyself— negative thoughts already left and I am embracing myself for who really I am. Today, I’m starting to do what I really want for myself and what really makes me happy. I don’t need wings to fly because I am already a fairy, achieving my goals in life with my own hand. I don't need super power to attain everything that I want because I’ve realized that myself will never leave me and I don’t need someone for I have myself. Today, I don’t need to envy those perfect character in the noble that I always read, I became happy in my life knowing that I am the leading lady of my own story.I’ve realized that I don’t need someone to fulfill the things that I want because I have me. I am the writer of my life and I am the one who’s doing my fate. Today, I am looking at the mirror, I’m happy knowing that this is me, the someone that I used to hate before is now loving herself for who really she was.​</a>

Yesterday, unlike my typical quarantine routine, I woke up early. The moment my alarm went off at 8:00am, I jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom to shower. Fifteen minutes was all it took for me to bath and dress. I was ready to go. My heart couldn't keep the excitement and joy. Finally, we were allowed to go out. 2 Once upon a time, the world lived as if there was no pause nor end. It was all hustle, grind, and run until everyone was breathless and exhausted from all the work they had to do. Then, life changed when the virus spread. People couldn't go out of their homes. Work and school stopped. Time seemingly slowed like never before. 3 Alcohol-based hand rubs reduce the growth of microorganisms by dissolving the bacteria's cellular membrane. 4 Dr. Mary Grace Dacuma of the UP Pandemic Response Team has released findings from a recent study on how an epidemic happens and what an epidemic wave is. She noted that the COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines most likely started with an imported case from an infected person or persons who entered the Philippines. The infected person with the virus is likely the index case that spread the virus to others locally. Dacuma pointed out that the index case(s), especially those that did not cause local transmission, does not form part of the epidemic wave. (Manila Bulletin 2020) 5. This virus does not have a nationality, it does not have an agenda or a political affiliation, it exists to spread where, when and how it can. The only thing that can stop it is community and cooperation. This is not a time for blame or division... The future is being written today, let's write it together with all of our hearts and our humanity. (Morgan, J. &amp; Rosemberg, A. 2020)​</a>

For 11 days, multifaceted personality Iza Calzado laid in her hospital bed, looking up at a white ceiling with her labored breathing echoing in her ears and her pulse throbbing with an intense cocktail of IV-deliveredmedication sloshing in her weakened veins. As her body struggled to keep itself alive, her spirit went through its own calvary; from the moment her doctors considered to intubate her, she knew. She came to terms with how death could be waiting for her right around the corner. She allowed herself to confront her mortality. After all, each good night could have turned out to be a goodbye. Iza was the 878th patient in the country to test positive for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease.Today, she joins the hundreds of Filipinos who have made full, often miraculous, recoveries. And like her fellow survivors, their loved ones, the healthcare workers who cared for them, and everyone who has become deeply involved in this crisis, she has much to teach us all about life."I am on a mission to get more iron in my body," Iza says with determination. If there's a will, there's a way, and Iza will do everything she can to help. And she encourages her fellow survivors to rise to the occasion as well. Everything  happens for a reason, and perhaps, they survived for a reason, too—and that reason could be for them to become instruments of change even through the simple yet selfless act of donating plasma to fuel lives anew.what os the five different influences?​</a>

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</a>

I sought Tatay's mind about the Baracuda and he said, "They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. "Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" I nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, "ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's "You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their stout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "llaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed. 3. While gulping their favorite drinks, people would gather because they would brag about their encounters with the Baracuda in the outskirts of the neighboring towns. They talked about combat tactics, death and victories. There was one thing that struck us most: the dried dark things the men took as hors d'oeuvres, which they claimed as ears and manhood of the enemies they encountered. To my young mind, that was excessively brutal and that scared me to even gaze at them both: the llaga and the Baracuda. 4. One afternoon, after dismissal time in school, I saw Nanay along with a number of parents rushing to meet us children at the school gate. They appeared frightened as they told the teachers that droves of Baracuda in vehicles were aiming their guns at people they passed by; hence, they were afraid the Baracuda would hurt the school children on their way home - the very reason they were fetching them. 5. Every day the Baracuda passed by either marching or riding in dirty-looking vehicles. At that time, they did not hurt anybody from Baroy; however, we heard news that the bodyguard of the governor got killed in an encounter. This drastically changed the picture of the highway. People from the remote mountains came down in their karomata (cart pulled by a carabao), filled with hungry-looking crying children, possessions in sacks, while tugging along domestic animals such as goats, pigs, dogs, etc. They were the evacuees who sought immediate refuge across Panguil Bay - to the province of Misamis Occidental and the cities of Tangub, Ozamiz, and Oroquieta via rented pump boats from the coasts of Baroy and Tubod.I need Po It now thanks ​</a>

                                            Write all the verbs you will find.It is true that people perceive change in different ways. Some members of the community believe that change is always for the better, while others think otherwise. Those who are in favor of change may argue that it poses a possibility for a particular person to improve him- or herself, both mentally and socially. From the mental perspective, changes relating to traveling and receiving education help one broaden one's mind and learn something new. As for the social perspective - it is empathy for others that he or she may acquire after suffering changes in his or her private life, because it is known that those who experienced various changes in relationships with their family or acquaintances may then better understand other people's feelings. This way, change improves not only person's mental, but also social and private aspect. In contrast, those who avoid changes point out the difficulties to readapt to them that many people experience. For instance, some large companies, Finnair for example, practice giving professional psychological and medicine support to those employees who were sacked due to companies' structural changes. Apparently, such policies infer that a spate of people may suffer from the difficulty to accustom to the changes and find their new way in life. In addition, it can be pointed out that changes regarding private affairs not always make a person better. For many people such changes simply cause a nervous breakdown, and, again, may jeopardize their health, since psychological aspect of a person is tightly connected to his or her general well-being. In conclusion, my view of the problem is that change is an indispensable part of our lives, so people should accept this fact and try to learn how to tackle it rather than avoid it, which is impossible. ​</a>

                                            My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it-a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university. knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary. with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.  1. What is the author's present situation? A. He is a biologist. B. He is an intern.

                                            young people out there -- to believe that you can make a difference your wagon to something bigger than yourselves. Let me tell you, this generation coming up unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic - I've seen you in every corner of the country. You believe in a fair, and just, and inclusive America. You know that constant change has been America's hallmark; that it's not something to fear but something to embrace. You are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward. You'll soon outnumber all of us, and I believe as a result the future is in good hands. My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won't stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you're young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President -- the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I'm asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change - but in yours. I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written: Yes, we can. Yes, we did. Yes, we can. Thank you. God bless you. May God continue to bless the United States of America.

I sought Tatay's mind about the Baracuda and he said, “They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. "Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" | nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, “ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's “You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their slout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "Ilaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed. 3. While gulping their favorite drinks, people would gather because they would brag about their encounters with the Baracuda in the outskirts of the neighboring towns. They talked about combat tactics, death and victories. There was one thing that struck us most: the dried dark things the men took as hors d'oeuvres, which they claimed as ears and manhood of the enemies they encountered. To my young mind, that was excessively brutal and that scared me to even gaze at them both: the llaga and the Baracuda. 4. One afternoon, after dismissal time in school, I saw Nanay along with a number of parents rushing to meet us children at the school gate. They appeared frightened as they told the teachers that droves of Baracuda in vehicles were aiming their guns at people they passed by; hence, they were afraid the Baracuda would hurt the school children on their way home - the very reason they were fetching them. 5. Every day the Baracuda passed by either marching or riding in dirty-looking vehicles At that time, they did not hurt anybody from Baroy; however, we heard news that the bodyguard of the governor got killed in an encounter. This drastically changed the picture of the highway. People from the remote mountains came down in their karomata (cart pulled by a carabao), filled with hungry-looking crying children, possessions in sacks, while tugging along domestic animals such as goals, pigs, dogs, etc. They were the evacuees who sought immediate refuge across Panguil Bay - to the province of Misamis Occidental and the cities of Tangub, Ozamiz, and Oroquieta vla rented pump boats from the coasts of Baroy and Tubod.​</h2><br />

Better pay, higher position - these did not even come to mind. I prayed for direction. No position in other companies was open and no job offer came. For a year, I tried to be patient. A time came when I was no longer sad. I had accepted my place and found joy in little things. No doubt I still wanted a new job, but there was faith and assurance that God would fulfill his purpose for me and his will would be done. Soon enough, I received not one but two job offers! Trough the whole year waiting experience, I found that I became stronger and learned more about Jesus and myself. Had this been the old me, I would have just been irritated and impatient and resigned. I would have been angry and negative. But in Jesus, the former things have come. "Anxious," "weak" come be turned to "trusting", "being patient." Just goes to show that the Lord really does change our attitude in life. Answer the following questions: 1.

                            14. Do not envy those people who were born great but rather, make yourself great through hardwork. Perhaps, we all grow through the process. Just like the flower, it needs proper care, right amount of water until it grows and becomes a beautiful flower that everyone will admire it. And you, you are like a flower who grows every single day of your life. You are like an art that even it is not colourful and it is just simple, you can still call it a masterpiece. You are flawed by design, your imperfections is what makes you perfect. You deserve all the love and not to be swathe by dilemmas, that even though you were destructed by many, loving yourself is still eternity.I used to envy someone people for the fact that they have the things that I want. Will they call me plagiarist for the fact that I am trying to copy them because all people love them? Will they sue me for committing mistake and that is to hate someone because of too much envious of that person? Because of toxic high standards in our society I became someone that isn’t really me. And I realized something, as I keep on growing each day, starting to comprehend things everyday. I realized that—Never let their wordsmakes you doubt aboutyourself and change you.Never let their glancemakes you scared of them.Never let them take offyour self-confidence.And never let them controlyour decisions in life.“Do not change yourself for others and let others change for you. You don't need to adjust yourself just to fit yourself with them.”Today, I woke up loving thyself— negative thoughts already left and I am embracing myself for who really I am. Today, I’m starting to do what I really want for myself and what really makes me happy. I don’t need wings to fly because I am already a fairy, achieving my goals in life with my own hand. I don't need super power to attain everything that I want because I’ve realized that myself will never leave me and I don’t need someone for I have myself. Today, I don’t need to envy those perfect character in the noble that I always read, I became happy in my life knowing that I am the leading lady of my own story.I’ve realized that I don’t need someone to fulfill the things that I want because I have me. I am the writer of my life and I am the one who’s doing my fate. Today, I am looking at the mirror, I’m happy knowing that this is me, the someone that I used to hate before is now loving herself for who really she was.​</h2><br />

Yesterday, unlike my typical quarantine routine, I woke up early. The moment my alarm went off at 8:00am, I jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom to shower. Fifteen minutes was all it took for me to bath and dress. I was ready to go. My heart couldn't keep the excitement and joy. Finally, we were allowed to go out. 2 Once upon a time, the world lived as if there was no pause nor end. It was all hustle, grind, and run until everyone was breathless and exhausted from all the work they had to do. Then, life changed when the virus spread. People couldn't go out of their homes. Work and school stopped. Time seemingly slowed like never before. 3 Alcohol-based hand rubs reduce the growth of microorganisms by dissolving the bacteria's cellular membrane. 4 Dr. Mary Grace Dacuma of the UP Pandemic Response Team has released findings from a recent study on how an epidemic happens and what an epidemic wave is. She noted that the COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines most likely started with an imported case from an infected person or persons who entered the Philippines. The infected person with the virus is likely the index case that spread the virus to others locally. Dacuma pointed out that the index case(s), especially those that did not cause local transmission, does not form part of the epidemic wave. (Manila Bulletin 2020) 5. This virus does not have a nationality, it does not have an agenda or a political affiliation, it exists to spread where, when and how it can. The only thing that can stop it is community and cooperation. This is not a time for blame or division... The future is being written today, let's write it together with all of our hearts and our humanity. (Morgan, J. &amp; Rosemberg, A. 2020)​</h2><br />

For 11 days, multifaceted personality Iza Calzado laid in her hospital bed, looking up at a white ceiling with her labored breathing echoing in her ears and her pulse throbbing with an intense cocktail of IV-deliveredmedication sloshing in her weakened veins. As her body struggled to keep itself alive, her spirit went through its own calvary; from the moment her doctors considered to intubate her, she knew. She came to terms with how death could be waiting for her right around the corner. She allowed herself to confront her mortality. After all, each good night could have turned out to be a goodbye. Iza was the 878th patient in the country to test positive for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease.Today, she joins the hundreds of Filipinos who have made full, often miraculous, recoveries. And like her fellow survivors, their loved ones, the healthcare workers who cared for them, and everyone who has become deeply involved in this crisis, she has much to teach us all about life."I am on a mission to get more iron in my body," Iza says with determination. If there's a will, there's a way, and Iza will do everything she can to help. And she encourages her fellow survivors to rise to the occasion as well. Everything  happens for a reason, and perhaps, they survived for a reason, too—and that reason could be for them to become instruments of change even through the simple yet selfless act of donating plasma to fuel lives anew.what os the five different influences?​</h2><br />

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams.

I sought Tatay's mind about the Baracuda and he said, "They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. "Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" I nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, "ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's "You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their stout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "llaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed. 3. While gulping their favorite drinks, people would gather because they would brag about their encounters with the Baracuda in the outskirts of the neighboring towns. They talked about combat tactics, death and victories. There was one thing that struck us most: the dried dark things the men took as hors d'oeuvres, which they claimed as ears and manhood of the enemies they encountered. To my young mind, that was excessively brutal and that scared me to even gaze at them both: the llaga and the Baracuda. 4. One afternoon, after dismissal time in school, I saw Nanay along with a number of parents rushing to meet us children at the school gate. They appeared frightened as they told the teachers that droves of Baracuda in vehicles were aiming their guns at people they passed by; hence, they were afraid the Baracuda would hurt the school children on their way home - the very reason they were fetching them. 5. Every day the Baracuda passed by either marching or riding in dirty-looking vehicles. At that time, they did not hurt anybody from Baroy; however, we heard news that the bodyguard of the governor got killed in an encounter. This drastically changed the picture of the highway. People from the remote mountains came down in their karomata (cart pulled by a carabao), filled with hungry-looking crying children, possessions in sacks, while tugging along domestic animals such as goats, pigs, dogs, etc. They were the evacuees who sought immediate refuge across Panguil Bay - to the province of Misamis Occidental and the cities of Tangub, Ozamiz, and Oroquieta via rented pump boats from the coasts of Baroy and Tubod.I need Po It now thanks ​</h2><br />

                            20. Write all the verbs you will find.It is true that people perceive change in different ways. Some members of the community believe that change is always for the better, while others think otherwise. Those who are in favor of change may argue that it poses a possibility for a particular person to improve him- or herself, both mentally and socially. From the mental perspective, changes relating to traveling and receiving education help one broaden one's mind and learn something new. As for the social perspective - it is empathy for others that he or she may acquire after suffering changes in his or her private life, because it is known that those who experienced various changes in relationships with their family or acquaintances may then better understand other people's feelings. This way, change improves not only person's mental, but also social and private aspect. In contrast, those who avoid changes point out the difficulties to readapt to them that many people experience. For instance, some large companies, Finnair for example, practice giving professional psychological and medicine support to those employees who were sacked due to companies' structural changes. Apparently, such policies infer that a spate of people may suffer from the difficulty to accustom to the changes and find their new way in life. In addition, it can be pointed out that changes regarding private affairs not always make a person better. For many people such changes simply cause a nervous breakdown, and, again, may jeopardize their health, since psychological aspect of a person is tightly connected to his or her general well-being. In conclusion, my view of the problem is that change is an indispensable part of our lives, so people should accept this fact and try to learn how to tackle it rather than avoid it, which is impossible. ​</h2><br />

                            22. My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it-a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university. knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary. with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.  1. What is the author's present situation? A. He is a biologist. B. He is an intern.

                            25. My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it - a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university, knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary, with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.

                            26. young people out there -- to believe that you can make a difference your wagon to something bigger than yourselves. Let me tell you, this generation coming up unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic - I've seen you in every corner of the country. You believe in a fair, and just, and inclusive America. You know that constant change has been America's hallmark; that it's not something to fear but something to embrace. You are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward. You'll soon outnumber all of us, and I believe as a result the future is in good hands. My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won't stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you're young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President -- the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I'm asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change - but in yours. I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written: Yes, we can. Yes, we did. Yes, we can. Thank you. God bless you. May God continue to bless the United States of America.
