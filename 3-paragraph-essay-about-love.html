                                            An Ideal Citizen 1. A citizen is a person who lives in a state and is governed by its laws in all matters. An ideal citizen is an asset to a nation. Countries are not good or bad but their citizens make them so. Smugglers, lawbreakers and people of bad character are also citizens of a country but they cannot be called ideal citizen. 2. An ideal citizen is every inch a patriot. Citizenship secures for the people a sense of security for their life and property. In a democratic country like India, a citizen enjoys right of voting in elections to public bodies. He can himself stand as a candidate for election to the municipal committee of his town and legislative bodies of his country .He can even stand for the office of the president of the country.3. A citizen enjoys several other advantages. It is the duty of the state to provide him with employment as far as possible. A citizen enjoys several facilities. The state provides him with essential services such as transport, right of voting, electricity, hospitals and schools for the education of his children. Modern states are welfare states. They are supposed to look after the welfare of the citizens. A citizen can stand up and fight for certain rights.  4. On the other hand, a citizen has to carry out certain duties and responsibilities. He is expected to obey the laws of his country. He must be loyal to the state. He or she must gladly offer his or her services to the state. In time of war or a national emergency, a citizen should serve the country in any capacity he is called upon to serve. Every citizen must support the police and the administration in general in the maintenance of peace. It is also the duty of all citizens to desist from creating disorder by communal riots.5 An ideal citizen tries to protect national property. He makes a right use of the facilities provided to him. He tries to maintain communal harmony in the country. He has a secular outlook. He is tolerant towards all faiths. He believes in the principle of peaceful co-existence. “Live and let live” is the guiding principle of his life. He is honest and fair in his dealings. He has a helpful attitude towards his fellow human beings. He refuses to be tempted into corruption or dishonesty. His life is an open book in honesty, diligence and amiability.  6. It is the duty of every citizen to be ready to offer his services for public duties. It is the fundamental duty of a citizen to pay taxes honestly. If he evades this, the government has the right to realize the taxes by force. An ideal citizen is ideal in his speech, conduct and writing. He is always ready to lay down his life for the sake of his country. His country is a motherland to him and he loves her from the core of his heart. The greatness of a country depends not on her material resources, but on her men and women. A nation is great if her citizens are great. A poet has rightly said: “Not gold, but only men, can make a nation strong and great; Men who for truth and honour’s sake.1. What concept is discussed and clarified in this essay?

                                            THE CASE OF LADY SANNOXBy Arthur Doyle                The short story "The Case of Lady Sannox" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is about forbidden love, and more specifically the consequences of forbidden love. In the story the main character is Douglas Stone, a very famous surgeon who is known to be able to complete operations that no one else would even dream of doing. Though many people did not see him as an attractive person, he was carrying on a relationship...with a married woman; Lady Sannox, very sought after, and not someone you would think to be interested in the likes of Douglas Stone. One night, as Stone is getting ready to visit his lover, he gets called upon by a strange visitor. This man, a Turk, asks Stone to come with him to perform a dangerous operation on his wife's face. He claimed that his wife had fainted and had cut her lip on one of the daggers of Almohades, which according to superstition, were very poisonous. The Turk told Stone that he believed that the only way to save his wife's life was to remove the lip that had been cut by the dagger. Stone, having become very intrigued by the whole story, decided to see for himself, so he allowed the Turk to take him to see the woman. When they arrived at the home, Stone was taken into a small room where a woman was lying on a bed semi-knocked out with opium. He immediately got to work on the surgery, cutting off her bottom lip in almost no time. As soon as he had finished, she started screaming in pain and her yashmak came off, revealing her real identity. To Douglas Stone's horror, the Turk's wife was none other than his lover, the Lady of Sannox! And the Turk revealed himself to be Lord Sannox, the woman's husband.  He, the Lord Sannox, then explained to Stone how he had found out about the affair, and how he had devised the plot to get his revenge. Then he sent Stone home warning him about the consequences of messing around with someone else's wife, and the pain he had caused because of it. In three (3) paragraph form of essay, what would you do if you were in the shoe of Lord Sannox, who is the husband of Lady Sannox? Will you do the same as how he made revenged for his wife? How would you handle your emotions?​</a>

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Topic: Mother's Love</p><p></p><p>A mother's love is like no other. It is unconditional, selfless, and pure. From the moment a child is born, a mother's life revolves around ensuring the wellbeing of her child. A mother is the first person that a child sees and feels, and the bond they share is unbreakable. A mother's love is a beautiful thing, but it is also incredibly powerful. It has the ability to heal and soothe, to inspire great acts of bravery, and to bring immense joy and happiness. </p><p></p><p>A mother's love is evident in all the small things she does. It's seen in the way she cooks and packs lunches for her children or how she wakes up early in the morning to make sure they get to school on time. It's the way she tucks them into bed at night, telling them stories and singing lullabies. A mother's love is also found in the way she teaches her children valuable life lessons and offers guidance when they stray off the right path. </p><p></p><p>Although a mother's love is powerful, it's not always easy. It requires patience, sacrifice, and tough love at times. Mothers have to make difficult choices, and sometimes they have to be the bad guy to ensure their child's safety and success. But even in moments of discipline, a mother's love remains unwavering. </p><p></p><p>In conclusion, a mother's love is a force to be reckoned with. It is the purest form of love and has the power to shape a child's life. Whether it's providing comfort in times of sadness or celebrating their successes, a mother's love is always present. It's a gift that keeps on giving even as we grow older. So let us never take our Mother's love for granted and cherish it in our hearts forever.</p><br />

He can himself stand as a candidate for election to the municipal committee of his town and legislative bodies of his country .He can even stand for the office of the president of the country.3. A citizen enjoys several other advantages. It is the duty of the state to provide him with employment as far as possible. A citizen enjoys several facilities. The state provides him with essential services such as transport, right of voting, electricity, hospitals and schools for the education of his children. Modern states are welfare states. They are supposed to look after the welfare of the citizens. A citizen can stand up and fight for certain rights.  4. On the other hand, a citizen has to carry out certain duties and responsibilities. He is expected to obey the laws of his country. He must be loyal to the state. He or she must gladly offer his or her services to the state. In time of war or a national emergency, a citizen should serve the country in any capacity he is called upon to serve.

He is always ready to lay down his life for the sake of his country. His country is a motherland to him and he loves her from the core of his heart.

                            12. THE CASE OF LADY SANNOXBy Arthur Doyle                The short story "The Case of Lady Sannox" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is about forbidden love, and more specifically the consequences of forbidden love. In the story the main character is Douglas Stone, a very famous surgeon who is known to be able to complete operations that no one else would even dream of doing. Though many people did not see him as an attractive person, he was carrying on a relationship...with a married woman; Lady Sannox, very sought after, and not someone you would think to be interested in the likes of Douglas Stone. One night, as Stone is getting ready to visit his lover, he gets called upon by a strange visitor. This man, a Turk, asks Stone to come with him to perform a dangerous operation on his wife's face. He claimed that his wife had fainted and had cut her lip on one of the daggers of Almohades, which according to superstition, were very poisonous. The Turk told Stone that he believed that the only way to save his wife's life was to remove the lip that had been cut by the dagger. Stone, having become very intrigued by the whole story, decided to see for himself, so he allowed the Turk to take him to see the woman. When they arrived at the home, Stone was taken into a small room where a woman was lying on a bed semi-knocked out with opium. He immediately got to work on the surgery, cutting off her bottom lip in almost no time. As soon as he had finished, she started screaming in pain and her yashmak came off, revealing her real identity. To Douglas Stone's horror, the Turk's wife was none other than his lover, the Lady of Sannox! And the Turk revealed himself to be Lord Sannox, the woman's husband.  He, the Lord Sannox, then explained to Stone how he had found out about the affair, and how he had devised the plot to get his revenge. Then he sent Stone home warning him about the consequences of messing around with someone else's wife, and the pain he had caused because of it. In three (3) paragraph form of essay, what would you do if you were in the shoe of Lord Sannox, who is the husband of Lady Sannox? Will you do the same as how he made revenged for his wife? How would you handle your emotions?​</h2><br />

Everything can be talked out. Why would I even let my anger, jealousy, madness or whatever it is make me do something bad or make me hurt people.</p><p></p><p>I will first calm myself down. Talk to my wife why she had an affair. Ask her if I ever did anything wrong and if our relationship cannot get better then, I will suggest a divorce so that she can be free to do whatever she wants without me minding her or just me minding my own business as we are not in a relationship anymore and I will take a rest so I heal the wound in my heart.</p><p></p><br />

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

Read the following narrative essay: 
Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

Read the following narrative essay: 
I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.
