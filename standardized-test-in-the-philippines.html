ALL SET FOR THE OPENING Marikina Mayor Marcelino Teodoro
tours media around the city’s COVID-19 testing facility whose opening
has been delayed by the lack of the health department’s seal of approval.
INQUIRER FILE/GRIG C. MONTEGRANDE
MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Health (DOH) has
finally given its go signal to Marikina City’s COVID-19 testing facility,
the local government announced Thursday.
“I had a talk with Sec. Duque two hours ago and the DOH
accreditation is already given to us,” Marikina Mayor Marcelino Teodoro
told dzBB in an interview.

What I Have Learned
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire also confirmed the
development in a Viber message to reporters.
Teodoro said they are eyeing to open the testing center on Friday
morning as they still must complete the list of individuals who shall be
prioritized for the testing.
“It may open tomorrow morning. For tonight, we are still
finishing our list of priorities for testing. We will prioritize those with
COVID-19 symptoms, “he said when asked when the laboratory will be
opened for mass testing.
To date, Marikina City has 109 confirmed COVID-19 cases
including 22 patients who recovered and 18 deaths.Marikina City’s
molecular laboratory is located along Bayan Bayanan Avenue in
Barangay Concepcion Uno.
In this news the writer shows, the new testing center has a floor
area of 160 square meters and has no other offices sharing the
building.
The city government earlier planned to establish a testing site on
the sixth floor of Marikina City Health Office but DOH rejected the
proposal because it did not pass biosafety standards for molecular
laboratories that process COVID-19 test samples.</a>

Classify the hypothesis as two-tailed, left-tailed, or right-tailed. 2. A traffic enforcer believes that the number of cars passing through a certain intersection during rush hours in weekdays follows a normal distribution with an average of 800. A new highway is opened, and it is hypothesized that the number of cars passing through the intersection will decrease as a result. A sample of 15 weekdays is taken, and the mean number of cars passing through the intersection is 750 with a sample standard deviation of 42.​</a>

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire also confirmed the
development in a Viber message to reporters.
Teodoro said they are eyeing to open the testing center on Friday
morning as they still must complete the list of individuals who shall be
prioritized for the testing.
“It may open tomorrow morning. For tonight, we are still
finishing our list of priorities for testing. We will prioritize those with
COVID-19 symptoms, “he said when asked when the laboratory will be
opened for mass testing.
To date, Marikina City has 109 confirmed COVID-19 cases
including 22 patients who recovered and 18 deaths.Marikina City’s
molecular laboratory is located along Bayan Bayanan Avenue in
Barangay Concepcion Uno.
In this news the writer shows, the new testing center has a floor
area of 160 square meters and has no other offices sharing the
building.
The city government earlier planned to establish a testing site on
the sixth floor of Marikina City Health Office but DOH rejected the
proposal because it did not pass biosafety standards for molecular
laboratories that process COVID-19 test samples.</h2><br />

Based on the data provided in a known website article entitled "Tuition Fee Guide: 2019 Cost of College Education in the Philippines", the average tuition fee in private colleges and universities is greater than P145,000 a year. Suppose that we want to perform a hypothesis test to find whether the average tuition fee is greater than P145.000. a. Determine the null and alternative hypotheses for the hypothesis test. b. Classify the hypothesis as two-tailed, left-tailed, or right-tailed. 2. A traffic enforcer believes that the number of cars passing through a certain intersection during rush hours in weekdays follows a normal distribution with an average of 800. A new highway is opened, and it is hypothesized that the number of cars passing through the intersection will decrease as a result. A sample of 15 weekdays is taken, and the mean number of cars passing through the intersection is 750 with a sample standard deviation of 42.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>At 3 PM, the hour hand would be at 15 spaces and the minute hand would be at 0 spaces. The minute hand would have to cover these extra 15 spaces in order to meet the hour hand. Now, 55 minutes are gained by the minute hand in 60 minutes. =&gt; 15 minutes would be gained in (60 / 55) x 15 = 180 / 11 minutes Thus, the two hands of the clock meet at 180 / 11 minutes past 3 PM, i.e., around 3:16:22 PM.   </p><br />

                            28. The Graduate Record Exam (GRE) is a standardized test required to be admitted to many graduate schools in the United States. A high score in the GRE makes admission more likely. According to the Educational Testing Service, the mean score for takers of GRE who do not have training courses is 555 with a standard deviation of 139. Brain Philippines (BP) offers expensive GRE training courses, claiming their graduates score better than those who have not taken any training courses. To test the company's claim, a statistician randomly selected 40 graduates of BP and asked their GRE scores and the random sample of 40 graduates he obtains recorded a mean score of 560 in GRE. Test at 5% level of significance.
