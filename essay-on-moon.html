                                            what is your opinion the kojiki creation story essay? "Once upon a time, when the world was still young, floating like oil, two gods, Izanagi no Mikoto and Izanami no Mikoto were commanded by the primal gods to make the land and fix it in place. The two stood on the Floating Bridge of Heaven and thrust the Heavenly Jewelled spear into the sea. The brine that dripped from the spear became an island where the two performed a marriage rite around a pillar. Izanami gave birth to the islands of Japan and their deities, the gods of the sea, river, mountain, field, tree, stone, fire and many others. But in giving birth to the fire god, she was burned and died. Izanagi followed Izanami to Yomi no Kuni (the Land of Dead) to urge her to return. She agreed to consult with the gods of Yomi, but warned him not to look at her. Impatient for Izanami's return, he entered the palace of the gods of Yomi, only to find her corpse horribly transformed. He fled, pursued by the shamed Izanami, and escaped by blocking the exit of Yomi with a large boulder. He then went to the river to purify himself by bathing (misogi). From his left eye when he cleansed it was born Amaterasu Omikami (Goddess of the Sun); Tsukushi no Mikoto (God of the Moon) was born from his right eye, and Susanoo no Mikoto (God of Storms) was born from  his nose. Izanagi charged Amaterasu with the rule of the High Plain of Heaven, Tsukushi no Mikoto with the Realm of Night, and Susanoo no Mikoto with the Plain of the Seas. Thus was born Japan and its surrounding world." ​</a>

Man's Short Life and Foolish Ambition by Margaret Cavendish In gardens sweet each flower mark did I, How they did spring, bud, blow, wither, and die. With that, contemplating of man's short stay, Saw man like to those flowers pass away. Yet built he houses, thick and strong and high, As if he'd live to all Eternity. Hoards up a mass of wealth, yet cannot fill His empty mind, but covet will he still. To gain or keep, such falsehood will he use! Wrong, right, or truth-no base ways will refuse. I would not blame him could he death out keep, Or ease his pains or be secure of sleep: Or buy Heaven's mansions-like the gods become, And with his gold rule stars and moon and sun: Command the winds to blow, seas to obey, Level their waves and make their breezes stay. But he no power hath unless to die, And care in life is only misery. This care is but a word, an empty sound, a Wherein there is no soul nor substance found; Yet as his heir he makes it to inherit, And all he has he leaves unto this spirit. To get this Child of Fame and this bare word, He fears no dangers, neither fire nor sword: All horrid pains and death he will endure, Or any thing can he but fame procure O man, O man, what high ambition grows Within his brain, and yet how low he goes! To be contented only with a sound, Wherein is neither peace nor life nor body foundpasagot po thankyouu​</a>

They make an extremely beautiful woman and, in seeing her, the Sun invites her to sit next to him at a feast. When the Moon arrives and sees the Sun, she is so ashamed that she hides her face. Because of that instance the Sun lost his wife, the Moon, and was only to rule during the day while the Moon was to rule the night. Whenever they are together the Moon covers her face in shame. (Myths... 1) The Dakota myth not only tells of how the sun and the moon were separated in the sky, but also the reason for the suns dominance over the moon when they are both in the sky at the same time. It is a simple tale, yet it explained a lot to the Dakotas. In the last two myths discussed, the sun and the moon started together and got separated in the sky. This is the true in quite a few other myths as well; another example being in Greek/Roman mythology, Apollo is the sun god and his sister Artemis is the moon goddess. This shows that humans see the connections between the two celestial beings and in trying to explain them, often do so with the sun and the moon together.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>GOOD LUCK</p><br />

"Once upon a time, when the world was still young, floating like oil, two gods, Izanagi no Mikoto and Izanami no Mikoto were commanded by the primal gods to make the land and fix it in place. The two stood on the Floating Bridge of Heaven and thrust the Heavenly Jewelled spear into the sea. The brine that dripped from the spear became an island where the two performed a marriage rite around a pillar. Izanami gave birth to the islands of Japan and their deities, the gods of the sea, river, mountain, field, tree, stone, fire and many others. But in giving birth to the fire god, she was burned and died. Izanagi followed Izanami to Yomi no Kuni (the Land of Dead) to urge her to return. She agreed to consult with the gods of Yomi, but warned him not to look at her. Impatient for Izanami's return, he entered the palace of the gods of Yomi, only to find her corpse horribly transformed. He fled, pursued by the shamed Izanami, and escaped by blocking the exit of Yomi with a large boulder. He then went to the river to purify himself by bathing (misogi). From his left eye when he cleansed it was born Amaterasu Omikami (Goddess of the Sun); Tsukushi no Mikoto (God of the Moon) was born from his right eye, and Susanoo no Mikoto (God of Storms) was born from  his nose. Izanagi charged Amaterasu with the rule of the High Plain of Heaven, Tsukushi no Mikoto with the Realm of Night, and Susanoo no Mikoto with the Plain of the Seas.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>the satellite of the earth that moves around the earth</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The moon is the most noticeable feature in the night sky and it is also the brightest, but it doesn't give off its own light. It is, actually, reflecting the light given off by the sun. Only seven percent of the light from the sun is reflected. Sometimes, the moon appears to change shape, but it is only because the sun is lighting different parts of it. When the moon passes through the earth's shadow and the earth comes right between the sun and the full moon, it's called a lunar eclipse. This is when the moon is dimmed and it turns in to a dark copper color.</p><p>             When you look at the moon from earth, it looks soft with light and dark shades of blue and gray. The dark parts of the moon are extensive, flat plains that were first observed by Galileo, an Italian scientist. He was the first person to look at the moon through a telescope in 1609. He, perhaps, thought that the plains were water because he called them "maria," which is a Latin would that means Seas. Today we have discovered that they are actually huge, deep, holes with edges covered by rock and soil. The word "maria" appears to imply that there is water on the moon, but we now know that there is none on its surface.</p><p>             Because there is no water on the moon, there can't be any life. Like all planets except earth, the moon has absolutely no known life. There is no water or air and the sky is continually black, but the stars are still visible. At night, the temperature on the surface of the moon becomes colder than any place on the face of the earth, but during the day, the rocks are only a slight bit hotter than that of boiling water. The Moon doesn't have an atmosphere and no fluid water, but now there is evidence that there is ice on the South Pole, which is permanently shaded. There is ice on the North Pole as well.</p><p>             Just like on earth, oxygen is the most abundant element on the moon except it's in the form ...</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The moon is a celestial marvel that has captured the human imagination for centuries. It is a glowing orb that illuminates the night sky, casting a soft light that shimmers across the Earth. As it waxes and wanes, the moon's luminosity creates a sense of mystery and wonder, evoking a sense of awe in those who gaze upon it.</p><p></p><p>When the moon is full, it is as if a giant silver coin has been placed in the sky. Its surface appears smooth and luminous, like a polished pearl. As the moon rises higher in the sky, it casts a pale glow over the landscape below, casting long, eerie shadows that add to the atmosphere of mystery.</p><p></p><p>The moon's phases also inspire a sense of metaphor and symbolism. Its waxing and waning have been likened to the ebb and flow of the tides, or to the cycles of birth and death. The full moon is often associated with romance and passion, while the new moon is linked to new beginnings and fresh starts.</p><p></p><p>The moon has been the subject of countless poems, songs, and stories, each seeking to capture its ethereal beauty and haunting allure. It has been a symbol of hope, of longing, and of mystery. Even today, as we have explored its surface and sent spacecraft to orbit around it, the moon remains a source of fascination and wonder, a reminder of the limitless possibilities of the universe.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the moon is a celestial body that is not just a natural satellite of the Earth, but also a symbol of mystique, wonder, and inspiration. Its phases, its smooth and luminous surface, and its metaphorical meaning inspire countless artists, writers, and thinkers to capture its beauty in words and imagery. The moon is a reminder that there is still much to be discovered and appreciated in the universe around us.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Man's Short Life and Foolish Ambition by Margaret Cavendish In gardens sweet each flower mark did I, How they did spring, bud, blow, wither, and die. With that, contemplating of man's short stay, Saw man like to those flowers pass away. Yet built he houses, thick and strong and high, As if he'd live to all Eternity. Hoards up a mass of wealth, yet cannot fill His empty mind, but covet will he still. To gain or keep, such falsehood will he use! Wrong, right, or truth-no base ways will refuse. I would not blame him could he death out keep, Or ease his pains or be secure of sleep: Or buy Heaven's mansions-like the gods become, And with his gold rule stars and moon and sun: Command the winds to blow, seas to obey, Level their waves and make their breezes stay. But he no power hath unless to die, And care in life is only misery. This care is but a word, an empty sound, a Wherein there is no soul nor substance found; Yet as his heir he makes it to inherit, And all he has he leaves unto this spirit. To get this Child of Fame and this bare word, He fears no dangers, neither fire nor sword: All horrid pains and death he will endure, Or any thing can he but fame procure O man, O man, what high ambition grows Within his brain, and yet how low he goes! To be contented only with a sound, Wherein is neither peace nor life nor body foundpasagot po thankyouu​</h2><br />

== OED ==
-Refer to the given paragraph below, entitled “Picturing Don Quixote”: Seventeenth-century images emphasized the title character’s pompous folly as well as the often rough-and-tumble action of many episodes. What type of description is used in the paragraph? 
= Subjective description  
-The term that refers to the consequences or events caused by the climax. 
= Falling action 
-What type of figure of speech is used in the following sentence? The lady in the water screamed like a banshee 
= Simile  
-Read the following narrative essay: In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic.  THE writer presented what point of view? 
= First person  
-Read the following excerpt from the short story, Dead Stars by Paz Marquez Benitez:  Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid.  What narrative device was used in the paragraph? 
= Flashback  
-Read the following example of a definition paragraph:  The term protein quality refers to the ratio of essential amino acids (eaa) in a protein in comparison with the ratio required by the body. A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein.   What is the strategy used in the development of the paragraph? 
= Denotation  
-Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:  The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east at the Yellow Sea, travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain.  What type of description is used in the paragraph? 
= Objective description  
-Read the following example of a definition paragraph:  Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194).  What is the strategy used in the development of the paragraph? 
= Extensive definition  
-Given the following sentence from the story, Dead Stars:  A round orange moon, "huge as a winnowing basket," rose lazily into a clear sky, whitening the iron roofs and dimming the lanterns at the windows.  What is the figure of speech used for the round orange moon? 
= Simile  
-The latin word from which the word "narration" comes 
= narrare</h2><br />
                        The subjective description is a kind of description that is based on the personal perspective or view, opinions and comments. Falling action is the part of a story where the consequences or changes of situation start to arise. Simile is the figurative speech that shows two things exactly the same. First person pertains to the main character of the story. This is commonly the first introduced character or subject from the story. Flashback is the process of reminiscing or looking back from the past. It is part of stories sometimes. Denotation means the literal and true meaning and definition of words. Objective description is fact-based writing or description. The word "Narration" was derived from the latin word, narrare. <br />
