                                            Activity 1: Research Analysis 1. Below is a sample background of the study of research. Read It carefully and then determine the topic, problem statement, brief literature review and the research gap. Place your answer on a separate sheet of paper. (3 pts. each) The K to 12 Curriculum was adopted in the Philippines in the school year 2012-2013 utilizing the spiral progression approach especially in the fields of Math and Science under the Elementary and hmior High School Level. The spiral progression works in a way that the learners learn simpler or basic concepts during lower grades which becomes more complex as they progressed to a higher grade. This approach which was based from Bruner's theory of Learning would seek to help learners in their mastery of the lesson and retention as they progressed from one grade to the next grade until they finished schooling In the old curriculum, Earth Science is being tackled in the 1 year level, Biology in the 2nd year level, Chemistry in the 3rd, and Physics in the 4" level but with the new curriculum today, the four areas or fields are now being tackled in every level from Grade 1-10, onc field per quarter so the topics were decongested. As the students now progressed into senior high, they will still have to take science subjects regardless of their track and strand. In its first implementation, the students were confused on the focus of their discussions in one level until such time that they adapted to it already. The problem now is, as they go to a higher level, they tend to forget what they have learned in the previous years/levels especially the basic concepts that they need. From the case study on the use of spiral progression approach in teaching science conducted by Samala (2015), she found out that teachers encountered a problem on the retention of concepts learned among the students, wherein, teachers need to review the previous concepts leamed in order to refresh the minds of the students. Though this was effective for students in remembering the concepts, it posed a problem also to the teachers as well as the students. Teachers would consume much time in reviewing rather than starting a new lesson. In the worst case scenario, the allotted time for new lessons are already being used up in re-discussing the previous concepts since some students are requesting the teacher to rediscuss the topic. This poses also a problem to the other students who knew the topic already and this would result to boredom on their part and less motivation to learn. As supported by the study of Mangali, Tongco, Aguinaldo, Calvaderos (2019), one student said that they spend more time in discussing the past lesson and less time for the new lesson. Also, according to Romulo (2015) as cited by Capili, Capilitan, Sequete (2015), students are having difficulty in relating new topics being learned to the previous ones and they have less retention rate to the previous topics learned. This would imply that as the students progressed from one level to another, they tend to forget the concepts that they are learning, thus mastery of the subject matter is also poor. Retention of learned concepts is not only a problem in the Philippine context but also in other countries. In Nigeria alone, teachers had encountered a problem on the retention of concepts in Chemistry among senior high school students as well as in Ecology and for this, several studies were conducted to improve the performance of the students as well as their retention. With all the research and literatures cited, the studies focused on specific fields of Science such as Biology, Chemistry, and Ecology. In the Philippines alone, there were no studies conducted on the rate of retention among the senior high school students on their science subject as a result of the spiral progression approach in their junior high. Also, the concept on retention mentioned in the studies were results of the studies conducted but not the focus of the entire research. Therefore, this study aims to determine the rate of retention of senior high school students in the various fields of Science like Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Physics in which learned concepts from these fields are useful in their physical Science, Earth and Life Science/Earth Science subjects for all strands and General Biology 1 and 2. General Chemistry 1 and 2, General Physics 1 and 2 for STEM and GAS students as well as the factors which affect their rate of retention to fully determine the necessary interventions/actions to be made to improve their mastery of lessons leading to retention. This would also serve as the springboard for widening the area of the research in the Division of Baguio City to be able to remedy the problems on retention of concepts experienced by teachers of various expertise. Furthermore, this study could lead to the development of various learning materials and strategies to enhance learning.​</a>

                            9. Activity 1: Research Analysis 1. Below is a sample background of the study of research. Read It carefully and then determine the topic, problem statement, brief literature review and the research gap. Place your answer on a separate sheet of paper. (3 pts. each) The K to 12 Curriculum was adopted in the Philippines in the school year 2012-2013 utilizing the spiral progression approach especially in the fields of Math and Science under the Elementary and hmior High School Level. The spiral progression works in a way that the learners learn simpler or basic concepts during lower grades which becomes more complex as they progressed to a higher grade. This approach which was based from Bruner's theory of Learning would seek to help learners in their mastery of the lesson and retention as they progressed from one grade to the next grade until they finished schooling In the old curriculum, Earth Science is being tackled in the 1 year level, Biology in the 2nd year level, Chemistry in the 3rd, and Physics in the 4" level but with the new curriculum today, the four areas or fields are now being tackled in every level from Grade 1-10, onc field per quarter so the topics were decongested. As the students now progressed into senior high, they will still have to take science subjects regardless of their track and strand. In its first implementation, the students were confused on the focus of their discussions in one level until such time that they adapted to it already. The problem now is, as they go to a higher level, they tend to forget what they have learned in the previous years/levels especially the basic concepts that they need. From the case study on the use of spiral progression approach in teaching science conducted by Samala (2015), she found out that teachers encountered a problem on the retention of concepts learned among the students, wherein, teachers need to review the previous concepts leamed in order to refresh the minds of the students. Though this was effective for students in remembering the concepts, it posed a problem also to the teachers as well as the students. Teachers would consume much time in reviewing rather than starting a new lesson. In the worst case scenario, the allotted time for new lessons are already being used up in re-discussing the previous concepts since some students are requesting the teacher to rediscuss the topic. This poses also a problem to the other students who knew the topic already and this would result to boredom on their part and less motivation to learn. As supported by the study of Mangali, Tongco, Aguinaldo, Calvaderos (2019), one student said that they spend more time in discussing the past lesson and less time for the new lesson. Also, according to Romulo (2015) as cited by Capili, Capilitan, Sequete (2015), students are having difficulty in relating new topics being learned to the previous ones and they have less retention rate to the previous topics learned. This would imply that as the students progressed from one level to another, they tend to forget the concepts that they are learning, thus mastery of the subject matter is also poor. Retention of learned concepts is not only a problem in the Philippine context but also in other countries. In Nigeria alone, teachers had encountered a problem on the retention of concepts in Chemistry among senior high school students as well as in Ecology and for this, several studies were conducted to improve the performance of the students as well as their retention. With all the research and literatures cited, the studies focused on specific fields of Science such as Biology, Chemistry, and Ecology. In the Philippines alone, there were no studies conducted on the rate of retention among the senior high school students on their science subject as a result of the spiral progression approach in their junior high. Also, the concept on retention mentioned in the studies were results of the studies conducted but not the focus of the entire research. Therefore, this study aims to determine the rate of retention of senior high school students in the various fields of Science like Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Physics in which learned concepts from these fields are useful in their physical Science, Earth and Life Science/Earth Science subjects for all strands and General Biology 1 and 2. General Chemistry 1 and 2, General Physics 1 and 2 for STEM and GAS students as well as the factors which affect their rate of retention to fully determine the necessary interventions/actions to be made to improve their mastery of lessons leading to retention. This would also serve as the springboard for widening the area of the research in the Division of Baguio City to be able to remedy the problems on retention of concepts experienced by teachers of various expertise. Furthermore, this study could lead to the development of various learning materials and strategies to enhance learning.​</h2><br />
