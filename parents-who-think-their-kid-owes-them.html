Kline                     Editor-in-Chief As our society gets better, kids get worst. Before 90's kids always respect and obey their parents. Now, when parents ask you to do something, you will just act like you did not hear them because you are busy on your mobile phones. Kids in this generation are always busy on their mobile phones.Some of them even stay up all night that affects the way they think. This is the probable reason why they disobey their parents. They tend to neglect what their parents are saying because they are focused on their gadgets. Another reason why kids disrespect is that they want more time to play than to study. Sometimes when their parents force them to study, they got mad. They even say bad words to their parents because they do not want to be disturbed. Parents and kids should respect each other. But kids need to obey or  their parents because their parents are their best friends for a lifetime. Parents somehow need to discipline their kids so they will learn how to respect them Kids, obey your parents Organize the details using the chart below.

Before 90's kids always respect and obey their parents. Now, when parents ask you to do something, you will just act like you did not hear them because you are busy on your mobile phones. Kids in this generation are always busy on their mobile phones. Some of them even stay up all night that affects the way they think. This is the probable reason why they disobey their parents. They tend to neglect what their parents are saying because they are focused on their gadgets. Another reason why kids disrespect is that they want more time to play than to study. Sometimes when their parents force them to study, they got mad. They even say bad words to their parents because they do not want to be disturbed. Parents and kids should respect each other. But kids need to obey or respect their parents because their parents are their best friends for a lifetime. Parents somehow need to discipline their kids so they will learn how to respect them. Kids, obey your parents. B. Organize the details using the chart below. Title of the text Who What Where When Why How C. Write down the summary on your answer sheet.

                                            1. "There is no love greater than a parents love." My
parents are amazing parents. Without them I would not
be the strong and healthy young men I am today. My
parents deserve to be happy, in order for that to happen,
they want to see me succeed in life, be happy, and live
life to the fullest. I owe my parents a lot, because they
are the ones who welcome me in this world. And without
them I wouldn't gain the knowledge that I have today. So
in return, when I succeed in life, I would make them the
happiest parents in the world. I thank them for never
giving up on me, although sometimes I am very
stubborn.

                            6. Do you believe in aswang? In your opinion, do Filipino parents use aswang stories as a scare tactic to discipline their children? What do you think are the cultural functions of aswang for parents who discipline their kids? please 100 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Personally, I do not believe in aswang. The belief in aswang is deeply embedded in Filipino culture and folklore, and it is widely accepted by many Filipinos. While some Filipino parents may use aswang stories as a scare tactic to discipline their children, it is important to note that such stories are also used to pass down cultural values and lessons. The cultural functions of aswang for parents who use them to discipline their children are twofold. Firstly, it is a way to instill fear in their children, in order to get them to respect and obey their parents. Secondly, it serves as a reminder to children that certain behaviors are not acceptable and can have dire consequences. Aswang can also be used to teach children to be aware of their environment and to take heed of warnings. Ultimately, aswang stories can be used to promote good behavior and reinforce the importance of respecting authority.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> However, the aswang is a mythical creature in Philippine folklore that is often depicted as a monster with a human-like appearance, and is said to prey on children and pregnant women, among others. It is possible that parents or caretakers may use the tale of the aswang to warn children against wandering off alone at night or staying out too late. Additionally, the aswang may have cultural significance and serve as a way for Filipinos to preserve their cultural heritage and traditions through storytelling.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>not 100 words but hope it helps</p><br />

Before 90's kids always respect and obey their parents. Now, when parents ask you to do something, you will just act like you did not hear them because you are busy on your mobile phones. Kids in this generation are always busy on their mobile phones. Some of them even stay up all night that affects the way they think. This is the probable reason why they disobey their parents. They tend to neglect what their parents are saying because they are focused on their gadgets. Another reason why kids disrespect is that they want more time to play than to study. Sometimes when their parents force them to study, they got mad. They even say bad words to their parents because they do not want to be disturbed. Parents and kids should respect each other. But kids need to obey or respect their parents because their parents are their best friends for a lifetime. Parents somehow need to discipline their kids so they will learn how to respect them. Kids, obey your parents. B. Organize the details using the chart below. Title of the text Who What Where When Why How C. Write down the summary on your answer sheet.

</p>Money Problems and Debt—Can the Bible Help?
Plan Your Spending. (Proverbs 21:5)Avoid Unnecessary Debt. (Proverbs 6:1-5)Keep money in its proper place. (Proverbs 28:22)Be content. (1 Timothy 6:8)<p></p>A key to success: Work together against debt.
<p>It will not help matters if you vent anger on your mate​—even if you had no part in incurring the debt. Now, perhaps more than ever, the Bible’s counsel at Ephesians 4:31 applies: “Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be taken away from you along with all badness.”</p><p>

                            26. What is your opinion about parents comparing their kids to other kids​</h2><br />
                        It's not a good influence to your child because they will be insecure about what you think they can't and other kids cam<p>My opinion about parents comparing their kids about other kids is not healthy at all.  It can lower the self-esteem of the child and the confidence of his/her to do the tasks that they needed to do. It may as well give anxiety and depression to the child which is not we always wanted. We should help the child by helping him/her at it's own pace. </p><br />

                            28. The kids must do what their parents say for them to be away from harm​</h2><br />
                        <p>I'm not sure if this is a True or False question, although here's an answer anyway :)</p><p></p><p><strong>ANSWER</strong><strong> </strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>True</p><p></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong> :</p><p>Children are easily influenced by adults, their surroundings, and their circumstances. As a parent, you have 18 years to influence a child before they're able to make rational decisions of their own.</p><p></p><p>Children are naive and immature because they're still not used to their surroundings, and are easily gullible. Which is why as a parent, you must try your best to warn your child about the dangers of the outside world without taking away their freedom.</p><p></p><p>The people that a child trusts the most are their parents, so depending on how you raise them or teach them about how dangerous this and that is, it will have a psychological impact on the child that'll stay until they grow up. </p><p></p><p>Most children are weak minded individuals who can't think for themselves, especially if they haven't reached the age of puberty. So naturally, children should follow their parents' words and be obedient, because they have no other choice than to follow them.</p><p></p><br />
