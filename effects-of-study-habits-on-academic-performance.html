Inyour notebook, copy the article below and underline the biased statements.andarK-Pop and Its Positive Influences on TeenagerseMest students assume that the music they like only influences their style. They wear clothes inspired by popular SouthKorean fashion. They get inspired for hair and makeup, too.Music relaxes people. One of the main benefits of listening to K-pop music while studying is that it acts as a stressreliever. K Pop music is often misunderstood as superficial. It's not. It's an emotional outlet, just like any other music that youwould recanmend to a student to listen. But when you get deeper into K-Pop music, you'll realize that it can be inspiring, too.Many tunes inspire students to work hard to achieve their dreams. Just take a look at the lyrics of 'Breakthrough' by Twice. Whena student struggles to write papers or study for the exams, that particular song can have an uplifting effect.KPop stars may be focused on their appearance. However, we cannot deny that they have to work hard to achieve thelifestyle that they lead. They practice for hours every day. They stay consistent with their healthy eating and exercise habits, andthey have great focus and determination,There are teens who become obsessed with K-Pop music. They imitate their favorite stars. They want to be thin and fit asthem. Such obsession can lead to eating disorders and depression. However, we can talk about the same extremes when wediscuss any other popular genre. When we take our attention away from the extremes, we'll realize that music, regardless of itsgenre, is beneficial for students. It helps them bond with their friends. It's a stress-relieving hobby, and students can benefit fromit.https://essentiallypop.com/epop/2020/03/impact-of-k-pop-music-on-academic-performance/​</a>

In which the researchers concluded that “procrastination” has a huge negative impact on their school activities especially to their academic performances. Furthermore, based on the findings of the study, the majority of the respondents guaranteed that procrastination is certainly not a beneficial routine. They tend to have low remarks and frequently fail to remember what they need to accomplish and the important errands they need to do because of their procrastination habit. It is also associated with a wide range of secondary issues, such as increased stress, that affects their physical and mental health. paki explain lang po​</a>

Determine your ineffective study habit practices that were proven to be bad for your school performance. Enumerate them so you could count and remember easily. Now that you are in Grade 8 and given the current set up of your studies, try to choose from your effective study habit practices that you can still apply this school year. e. Identify those that are effective but need to be modified due to change of learning modality. f. Add other study habit practices which you think are lacking, for instance, having a regular area or space to set up your modules, notebooks and other materials, schedule a consultation with your teachers etc. g. Display your academic goal and effective study habit practices in your study area as a reminder for you to do it all the time.​</a>

Inyour notebook, copy the article below and underline the biased statements.andarK-Pop and Its Positive Influences on TeenagerseMest students assume that the music they like only influences their style. They wear clothes inspired by popular SouthKorean fashion. They get inspired for hair and makeup, too.Music relaxes people. One of the main benefits of listening to K-pop music while studying is that it acts as a stressreliever. K Pop music is often misunderstood as superficial. It's not. It's an emotional outlet, just like any other music that youwould recanmend to a student to listen. But when you get deeper into K-Pop music, you'll realize that it can be inspiring, too.Many tunes inspire students to work hard to achieve their dreams. Just take a look at the lyrics of 'Breakthrough' by Twice. Whena student struggles to write papers or study for the exams, that particular song can have an uplifting effect.KPop stars may be focused on their appearance. However, we cannot deny that they have to work hard to achieve thelifestyle that they lead. They practice for hours every day. They stay consistent with their healthy eating and exercise habits, andthey have great focus and determination,There are teens who become obsessed with K-Pop music. They imitate their favorite stars. They want to be thin and fit asthem. Such obsession can lead to eating disorders and depression. However, we can talk about the same extremes when wediscuss any other popular genre. When we take our attention away from the extremes, we'll realize that music, regardless of itsgenre, is beneficial for students. It helps them bond with their friends. It's a stress-relieving hobby, and students can benefit fromit.https://essentiallypop.com/epop/2020/03/impact-of-k-pop-music-on-academic-performance/​</h2><br />

In which the researchers concluded that “procrastination” has a huge negative impact on their school activities especially to their academic performances. Furthermore, based on the findings of the study, the majority of the respondents guaranteed that procrastination is certainly not a beneficial routine. They tend to have low remarks and frequently fail to remember what they need to accomplish and the important errands they need to do because of their procrastination habit. It is also associated with a wide range of secondary issues, such as increased stress, that affects their physical and mental health. paki explain lang po​</h2><br />
