Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It&#039;s so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don&#039;t quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don&#039;t give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person&#039;s behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don&#039;t realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don&#039;t have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am &#039;better than..., or &#039;worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can&#039;t see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It&#039;s Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others.

                                            since the beginning of time, beauty standards have been defined and coveted. Every time standards change, the current generation’s perception of themselves does, too. For my generation, our butts aren’t big enough, our stomachs aren’t flat enough and our bodies aren’t curvy enough. For the generation before us, their hair wasn’t big enough or their butts flat enough. The common denominator is that these standards have a negative effect on those who are exposed to them. It especially affects teens and pre-teens, as they are just coming into who they are, and self-image is a large part of this. According to the Park Nicollet Melrose Center, 53 percent of thirteen-year-old American girls are unhappy with their bodies. The number increases to 78 percent by the time they reach 17.  A negative self-image can not only contribute to several mental illnesses and disorders, but problems that last a lifetime. It’s extremely hard to combat insecurity once you’ve dealt with it before. A 2010 study focused on girls ages 13 to 17 found nine out of 10 girls felt pressured by the media and fashion industries to be skinny. The media is a constant reminder of the narrow definition of what beauty has become. Places like Victoria’s Secret who denounce plus-size women who they don’t “market” to when they’re one of the biggest beauty stores in the world play a large part in this. You also have stores whose sizes run smaller than what is normal, bringing on insecure thoughts. The biggest problem is the media. Teens and pre-teens spend most of their time on social media, looking at these ridiculous body goals and looks. These images are doctored, airbrushed and usually heavily-edited. I have no problem with anyone who gets plastic surgery, but what about the girls who see those bodies and compare themselves? It’s unhealthy, at the very least. Subscribing to these images can only have a negative effect on these young women who are still growing into who they are, in a stage of their life already plagued with enough self-doubt. Magazines are not exempt from this problem. Magazines are largely digital these days, and they also utilize the various practices of editing the images they put out. In fact, magazines are the professionals at this. Magazine editors often lighten skin colors, take in hips and lengthen legs — the list goes on. American actress Zendaya was a victim of such manipulation in 2015. The singer called out Modeliste magazine for editing her body in images shot for the issue. The then 19-year-old wrote on Instagram, “Had a new shoot come out today and was shocked when I found my 19 year old hips and torso quite manipulated. These are the things that make women self conscious, that create the unrealistic ideals of beauty that we have.” The images are not without implications at all, and it’s irresponsible for those charged with creating the current images of beauty to keep putting them out. Why publish an image of someone who doesn’t even look like the image? It only helps to foster unhealthy thought processes, low self-esteem and problems for people growing up alongside them. make a reflection essay of that story​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Introduction:<p>In her essay "Respect Begets Respect", Aruna Ladva emphasizes the importance of giving respect to all individuals, regardless of their actions, because every person is worthy of respect simply because they exist.</p><p></p>Body:<p>The author argues that respect is an innate quality that we possess, and we should not have to make an effort to give it. However, it is crucial to have self-respect before giving respect to others. Self-respect helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others and to build our sense of self from the inside. The author also notes that when we love and respect ourselves, we can see the beauty and specialties of others, making it easier to give respect and create harmony.</p><p></p>Idea 1:<p>According to the author, respect is not only for those who deserve it but for everyone. To give respect to all individuals, even those who do not measure up to our standards, is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect reflects more on us than the person in front of us. Waiting for others to become deserving or withholding respect until we feel they are worthy deprives us of exercising this quality, which is a valuable treasure.</p><p></p>Idea 2:<p>The author suggests that we are beings of love and that we should not seek love, approval, or regard from others because we already possess it within ourselves. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others. A person with self-respect understands that comparing or competing with others is futile and nonsensical. Comparing and competing are symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p></p>Idea 3:<p>Lastly, the author believes that each one of us came onto this earth to share a particular quality with the world. Therefore, it is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others, even when it is not readily apparent.

By looking for the beauty and specialties in others, we can exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will naturally earn us respect from others.</p><p></p>Reflection:<p>After reading the essay, I learned that respect is not something that we have to earn but something that we should give freely to all individuals. Self-respect is crucial because it forms the foundation for giving respect to others. Comparing and competing with others are futile and nonsensical, and they stem from a fragile, inflated ego. It is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others to exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will earn us respect from others naturally.</p><p></p><p></p><strong>#</strong><strong>CarryOnLearning</strong><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><br />

A 2010 study focused on girls ages 13 to 17 found nine out of 10 girls felt pressured by the media and fashion industries to be skinny. The media is a constant reminder of the narrow definition of what beauty has become. Places like Victoria’s Secret who denounce plus-size women who they don’t “market” to when they’re one of the biggest beauty stores in the world play a large part in this. You also have stores whose sizes run smaller than what is normal, bringing on insecure thoughts. The biggest problem is the media. Teens and pre-teens spend most of their time on social media, looking at these ridiculous body goals and looks. These images are doctored, airbrushed and usually heavily-edited. I have no problem with anyone who gets plastic surgery, but what about the girls who see those bodies and compare themselves? It’s unhealthy, at the very least. Subscribing to these images can only have a negative effect on these young women who are still growing into who they are, in a stage of their life already plagued with enough self-doubt. Magazines are not exempt from this problem. Magazines are largely digital these days, and they also utilize the various practices of editing the images they put out. In fact, magazines are the professionals at this. Magazine editors often lighten skin colors, take in hips and lengthen legs — the list goes on. American actress Zendaya was a victim of such manipulation in 2015. The singer called out Modeliste magazine for editing her body in images shot for the issue. The then 19-year-old wrote on Instagram, “Had a new shoot come out today and was shocked when I found my 19 year old hips and torso quite manipulated. These are the things that make women self conscious, that create the unrealistic ideals of beauty that we have.” The images are not without implications at all, and it’s irresponsible for those charged with creating the current images of beauty to keep putting them out. Why publish an image of someone who doesn’t even look like the image? It only helps to foster unhealthy thought processes, low self-esteem and problems for people growing up alongside them. make a reflection essay of that story​</h2><br />
