                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The Limited Benefits of Deforestation</strong></p><p><strong>Deforestation may have wide ranging negative consequences; however, it is through this process that you enjoy certain benefits. Lands are cleared to provide you with shelter and an urbanized community to reside in, as well as adequate farming lands for planting and cattle raising. In addition, food production, such as planting and cattle raising, is a lucrative industry that can be a source of employment and economic gains to many, thereby reducing unemployment rates. Deforestation is also the means to accommodate the ever-growing world population. This paved the way for the rise of civilizations and industrialization. However, in the future, we will have to bear the brunt of overly exploited ecosystems. For these reasons, deforestation has limited benefits.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Endangered Animals</strong></p><p><strong>Threats to their habitat and their biodiversity have caused these animals, such as the Javan Rhinoceros from Indonesia and Vietnam and the Cross River Gorilla from Nigeria and Cameroon, to be endangered. The Javan Rhinoceros is now very few in number, with poachers prizing its horn and multinational companies converting the forests to industrial lands. The rhinoceros has narrow chances of survival. Similarly, the Cross River Gorilla is being hunted for its meat, and its species range is mostly owned by a few individuals. As a result, these animals face a high risk of extinction.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Endangered Animals (continued)</strong></p><p><strong>Besides these threats, climate change is also affecting the survival of these animals. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns are disrupting their ecosystems and making it difficult for them to find food and shelter. In addition, the spread of diseases, such as the recent outbreak of the coronavirus, is also posing a threat to these animals.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Furthermore, the loss of biodiversity can have wider consequences for the whole ecosystem. For example, the disappearance of a particular species can disrupt the balance of the food chain, leading to a cascade of negative effects on other species. In like manner, the loss of a keystone species, such as the Javan Rhinoceros or the Cross River Gorilla, can have a ripple effect on the entire ecosystem.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>For these reasons, it is important to protect endangered animals and their habitats. Governments and organizations around the world are working to implement conservation efforts and raise awareness about the importance of biodiversity. By taking action, we can help ensure the survival of these animals and the ecosystems they depend on.</strong></p><p></p><br />
