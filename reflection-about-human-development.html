Humans, being considered as a superior being exploited nature and have forgotten that they are just part of the natural surroundings just like other non-human entities like plants and animals. In Lesson 2, you shall learn about the concepts of environmentalism and sustainability. It is hoped that after completing this module, you will be able to realize that care for the environment contributes to health, well-being, and sustainable development and be able to demonstrate the virtues of prudence and frugality towards the environment.

                        <p></p><p></p><p>As human beings, we all have personal qualities that we would like to cultivate and develop to become better versions of ourselves. Whether it's kindness, perseverance, or humility, the desire to improve ourselves is inherent in our nature. However, it's not enough to simply list these qualities; we must also create a plan for growth to develop them.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, it's essential to reflect on why we desire to cultivate these personal qualities. Is it for personal fulfillment, or to benefit those around us? Understanding the motivation behind our desire to grow is critical to creating an effective plan.</p><p></p><p>Once we've identified our motivations, we can then begin to identify the steps we need to take to develop these qualities. For example, if we want to cultivate kindness, we can start by performing small acts of kindness towards others, such as giving compliments or helping someone in need. Over time, these small acts can become habits, leading to a more significant overall shift in our behavior.</p><p></p><p>It's also important to recognize that personal growth is a continuous process. We must remain committed to our plan, even in the face of setbacks and challenges. The road to personal growth is not always easy, but with dedication and perseverance, we can achieve our goals.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, cultivating personal qualities is an essential aspect of being human. By reflecting on our motivations, identifying steps for growth, and remaining committed to our plan, we can develop the qualities that make us better individuals. Personal growth is a continuous process, but with effort and dedication, we can all become the best versions of ourselves.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Self-Confidence and Performance</p><p>Self-confidence is considered one of the most influential motivators and regulators of behavior in people's everyday lives (Bandura, 1986). A growing body of evidence suggests that one's perception of ability or self-confidence is the central mediating construct of achievement strivings (e.g., Bandura, 1977; Ericsson et al., 1993; Harter, 1978; Kuhl, 1992; Nicholls, 1984). Ericsson and his colleagues have taken the position that the major influence in the acquisition of expert performance is the confidence and motivation to persist in deliberate practice for a minimum of 10 years.</p><p></p><p>Self-confidence is not a motivational perspective by itself. It is a judgment about capabilities for accomplishment of some goal, and, therefore, must be considered within a broader conceptualization of motivation that provides the goal context. Kanfer (1990a) provides an example of one cognitively based framework of motivation for such a discussion. She suggests that motivation is composed of two components: goal choice and self-regulation. Self-regulation, in turn, consists of three related sets of activities: self-monitoring, self-evaluation, and self-reactions. Self-monitoring provides information about current performance, which is then evaluated by comparing that performance with one's goal. The comparison between performance and goal results in two distinct types of self-reactions: self-satisfaction or -dissatisfaction and self-confidence expectations. Satisfaction or dissatisfaction is an affective response to past actions; self-confidence expectations are judgments about one's future capabilities to attain one's goal. This framework allows a discussion of self-confidence as it relates to a number of motivational processes, including setting goals and causal attributions.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sa wekapidea kopo yan kinuha basahin nyo nalang po</p><p></p><br />

He argued that the purpose of education is not just to acquire knowledge, but to use that knowledge to improve society.John Dewey - Dewey believed in experiential learning, where students acquire knowledge about the world through the senses, learning by doing and by interacting with the environment. He argued that students learn best when they are actively engaged in the learning process.Paulo Freire - Freire believed that teachers should lead society rather than follow it. He argued that teachers are agents of change and should work to promote social justice and equality.Paulo Freire - Freire believed that a democratic relationship between the teacher and her students is necessary in order for the conscientization process to take place. Conscientization is the development of critical consciousness, where students become aware of the social, political, and economic forces that shape their lives.Paulo Freire - Freire believed that education and literacy are the vehicle for social change. He argued that humans must learn to resist oppression and not become its victims, nor oppress others. To do so requires dialogue and critical consciousness, the development of awareness to overcome domination and oppression.John Dewey - Dewey believed that children are socially active human beings who want to explore their environment and gain control over it. He argued that education should be child-centered and focused on the needs and interests of the student.George Counts - Counts was a social reconstructionist who believed in the importance of equality or equity in both society and education. He argued that barriers of socio-economic class and racial discrimination should be eradicated.George Counts - Counts believed that schools should become instruments for social improvement rather than an agency for preserving the status quo. He argued that schools should work to promote social justice and equality.John Dewey - Dewey believed that simple ideas become more complex through comparison, reflection, and generalization- the inductive method. He argued that students should be encouraged to think critically, to question assumptions, and to draw conclusions based on evidence.Herbert Spencer - Spencer believed in Social Darwinism, which is the application of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to human societies. He argued that individual competition leads to social progress, and that only the fittest survive.<p></p><p></p><br />
