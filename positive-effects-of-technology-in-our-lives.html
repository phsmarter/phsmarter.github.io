                                            In every aspect of our life, there will always be two sides of the coin. With the rapid development of information and communication technologies, a lot of advantages have been served to us to make our lives easy and productive. But we cannot deny the fact that these will also bring disadvantages. But whether the effect is positive or negative, ICT is already here and we can do nothing but adopt to it. Therefore, instead of delving into the negative impacts of ICT, why not, use this to counteract the problem brought by it. And so, in this activity, you identify at least three negative effects of some ICT to you lately and think of ways that other ICT can combat those effects. Emphasize the technology that you are going to use or apply to battle the problem.

With the rapid development of information and communication technologies, a lot of advantages have been served to us to make our lives easy and productive. But we cannot deny the fact that these will also bring disadvantages. But whether the effect is positive or negative, ICT is already here and we can do nothing but adopt to it.

And so, in this activity, you identify at least three negative effects of some ICT to you lately and think of ways that other ICT can combat those effects. Emphasize the technology that you are going to use or apply to battle the problem.
