                                            K to 12 is a kind of educational foundation where you can hone your talents and skills. It provides additional knowledge to students who have graduated from junior high school. K to 12 education,preparing children for adult responsibilities, these will be a preparation when we are able to take a course in college.Others who have graduated k to 12 can get a job, such as others who do not have enough money to take the desired course in college, so others prefer to study up to k to 12 only.Critics say that its implementation could only worsen the issue on education in the country. Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, a known critic of the program, said that the country appears to be unprepared for K-12 due to inadequacy in resources, tools, classrooms, etc. (Reyes, 2015). Though some people cannot see its relevance, the K-12 program is still beneficial as it gives a better quality of education, provides job opportunities for high school graduates, and prepares the country for ASEAN Integration.The students are more concerned about this, they are having a hard time going to junior high school because of the lack of money, it is even more difficult for the student to choose a strand because of the thought of whether they will have more difficulty here Or not? extended they are still studying instead of graduating and can find a good job. K to 12 is one of the most important aspects implemented in education, because it is not only here that the talent and talent of a student can be honed but also that you manage properly how to do it.pa summarize naman po nito plss kaylangan lang​</a>

                                            Let's reform the K-12 program Filipino students face a serious gap in leaming as a result of the world's longest community lockdown that put them out of physical classrooms for nearly two years. What has been trumpeted as a savior for poor families which cannot afford to complete four years of college education turned out to be a failure-inadequately and poorly programmed Waste of money and time for parents and students for the two years of delay Adding woes was the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in two more years of stunted education. The Philippines, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank, had the longest pandemic-induced school closures among the 122 countries covered, breaking the 70-week mark since the pandemic began in 2020. Prolonged school closures, the Word Bank added, would aggravate the leaming gap and result in decreased productivity and earnings by the time the students join the workforce. And then there's the inutile K-12 program that only added woes to parents scrambling for resources to sustain their children's education. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has issued a directive to have a thorough review of the K-12 program. The late president Benigno Aquino III signed the K-12 law as his administration's legacy in education, despite pleas from teachers, parents, and other stakeholders to delay its implementation. What now with K-12? Like-minded educators are proposing that K-12 be optional, especially for industries that can accommodate short-course holders. Processing Questions: 1.

                            3. k-12 new issue essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The K-12 program in the Philippines has been a topic of debate for several years now. While the program aims to improve the quality of education in the country by lengthening the basic education cycle and aligning it with international standards, it has also faced various challenges and criticisms.</p><p></p><p>One of the main issues with the K-12 program is the financial burden it places on families, particularly those who are struggling to make ends meet. The additional two years of senior high school means more expenses for tuition, books, and other school fees. This has led to concerns about the accessibility of education, especially for those in low-income households.</p><p></p><p>Another issue is the readiness of schools and teachers to implement the K-12 program. Many schools lack the necessary resources and infrastructure to provide quality education, and teachers need proper training to effectively teach the new curriculum. This has led to uneven implementation and quality of education across the country.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the K-12 program has been criticized for its focus on producing graduates who are employable, rather than well-rounded individuals who are critical thinkers and problem solvers. The emphasis on technical skills and vocational education has been seen as a move away from the liberal arts and humanities, which are essential for developing a well-informed and engaged citizenry.</p><p></p><p>Despite these challenges, the K-12 program also has its benefits. The additional two years of senior high school provides students with more time to explore their interests and strengths, and to prepare for college or the workforce. The program also aims to provide students with skills that are relevant to the needs of the 21st century, such as communication, digital literacy, and global awareness.</p><p></p><p>To address the issues surrounding the K-12 program, the government should provide more funding for education and ensure that schools are properly equipped to implement the new curriculum. Teachers should also be given adequate training and support to effectively deliver the new curriculum. Moreover, the government should ensure that the K-12 program provides a well-rounded education that emphasizes critical thinking, creativity, and citizenship, alongside technical skills and vocational education.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while the K-12 program in the Philippines has faced various challenges and criticisms, it also provides opportunities for students to develop their skills and prepare for college or the workforce. Addressing the issues surrounding the program requires a concerted effort from the government, schools, teachers, and other stakeholders to ensure that every student can access quality education and reach their full potential.</p><p></p><p>pa brainliest ty</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Issue</strong>: The K to 12 education system has been a controversial topic in many countries, with some arguing that it is unnecessary and should be abolished.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Claim</strong>: K to 12 should not be abolished.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Argument</strong>: The K to 12 education system is important because it provides students with a more comprehensive education, better prepares them for college and the workforce, and promotes a more equitable and inclusive education system. The additional years of schooling in K to 12 allow students to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as knowledge in specialized areas such as technical-vocational education. Moreover, the K to 12 system provides students with a smoother transition to college and the workforce, as they are better prepared for the demands and challenges of higher education and the job market. Lastly, the K to 12 system promotes a more equitable and inclusive education system by providing opportunities for all students, regardless of their socio-economic background, to receive a quality education.</p><p></p><p><strong>4.Evidence</strong>:</p><p></p><p>According to the Department of Education in the Philippines, the K to 12 system has been successful in improving the quality of education, with more students passing the college entrance exams and being employed after graduation.</p><p>A study conducted by the World Bank showed that the K to 12 system has led to a more equitable education system, with increased access to education for students in rural and remote areas.</p><p>A survey conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority showed that 71.2% of K to 12 graduates are employed, compared to 59.7% of high school graduates.</p><p></p><p><strong>5. Counter argument:</strong> Some argue that the K to 12 system is unnecessary and places an additional burden on families, as they have to pay for an additional two years of schooling.</p><p></p><p><strong>6. Rebuttal</strong>: While it is true that the K to 12 system may be an added expense for some families, the benefits of the additional years of schooling outweigh the costs. Moreover, the government provides financial assistance and scholarship programs for students who are unable to afford the additional years of schooling. Ultimately, the K to 12 system is an investment in the future of students and the country, as it provides a more comprehensive and equitable education system that better prepares students for success in college and the workforce.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>School Uniform</p><p></p><p>I believe that school uniform policies should be implemented in schools. School uniforms have been shown to have numerous benefits, including promoting a sense of unity and equality among students, improving student behavior and academic performance, and creating a safer and more professional learning environment.</p><p></p><p>One of the main arguments in favor of school uniforms is that they promote a sense of unity and equality among students. By requiring all students to wear the same clothing, school uniforms help to eliminate social divisions based on clothing choices and economic status. This can lead to a more positive and inclusive school culture, where all students feel valued and accepted.</p><p></p><p>In addition to promoting unity and equality, school uniforms have been shown to improve student behavior and academic performance. Studies have found that students who wear uniforms are more likely to have better attendance, higher grades, and fewer discipline issues compared to students who do not wear uniforms. This is likely due to the fact that uniforms help to create a more focused and distraction-free learning environment, where students are more likely to be engaged and motivated to succeed.</p><p></p><p>Finally, school uniforms can help to create a safer and more professional learning environment. By requiring students to wear specific clothing, schools can set clear expectations for behavior and appearance, which can help to reduce the risk of violence, bullying, and other disruptive behaviors. Additionally, uniforms can help to create a more formal and respectful atmosphere, which can be particularly beneficial for high school students who may be preparing for the transition to college or the workforce.</p><p></p><p>Overall, I believe that the benefits of school uniforms far outweigh any potential drawbacks. By promoting unity, improving student behavior and academic performance, and creating a safer and more professional learning environment, school uniforms can be an invaluable tool for supporting student success. I strongly encourage schools to consider implementing a school uniform policy.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> adios </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Topic: Dating/PDA Among Students in School</p><p></p><p>I believe that dating and public displays of affection (PDA) among students in school should not be allowed. There are several reasons why I hold this position, and I will present them here in an effort to convince you to support my stand.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, allowing dating and PDA in school can be disruptive to the learning environment. When students are focused on their relationships rather than their studies, it can be difficult for them to concentrate and stay on task. This can lead to decreased academic performance and a lack of focus in class.</p><p></p><p>In addition, dating and PDA can lead to distractions and disruptions in the classroom, which can affect the learning experiences of not just the students involved, but also their peers. This can create an unpleasant and unproductive environment for everyone.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, dating and PDA can also contribute to bullying and peer pressure among students. Students who are not in relationships may feel left out or ostracized, which can lead to negative behaviors such as bullying or exclusion. This can have serious consequences for the mental health and well-being of students.</p><p></p><p>Finally, I believe that allowing dating and PDA in school is not appropriate because it goes against traditional values and expectations for behavior in school. School is a place for learning, not for romance and physical intimacy. By allowing these activities, we may be sending the wrong message to students about what is acceptable behavior in a learning environment.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, I believe that dating and PDA among students in school should not be allowed because they can disrupt the learning environment, contribute to distractions and disruptions in the classroom, lead to bullying and peer pressure, and go against traditional values and expectations for behavior in school. While it is natural for students to have feelings of attraction towards their peers, it is important to remember that school is a place for learning, and these activities can take away from that purpose. Therefore, I strongly encourage you to support my stand and advocate for a ban on dating and PDA in school.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Dating/PDA Among Students in School</strong></p><p></p><p>As a student, I strongly believe that dating and public displays of affection (PDA) should be allowed within the school setting. There are several reasons why I hold this position.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, students have a right to freedom of expression and should be allowed to express their feelings towards their romantic partners in a responsible and respectful manner. As long as their actions do not disrupt the learning environment or violate the rights of others, they should be allowed to express their love and affection towards one another.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, prohibiting dating and PDA may actually lead to more problems rather than solving them. For example, students who are not allowed to express their feelings openly may resort to secretive and potentially risky behavior, such as sneaking around or engaging in sexual activity. By allowing dating and PDA, schools can create a safer and more open environment where students feel comfortable discussing and addressing their relationships.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, dating and PDA can serve as important learning experiences for students. Learning how to navigate and communicate in a healthy relationship is an important life skill that can benefit students in the long term. By allowing students to experience and learn from dating and PDA within a controlled and supervised environment, schools can help students develop important social and emotional skills.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, I believe that dating and PDA should be allowed within the school setting.</p><p></p><br />

                            27. K to 12 is a kind of educational foundation where you can hone your talents and skills. It provides additional knowledge to students who have graduated from junior high school. K to 12 education,preparing children for adult responsibilities, these will be a preparation when we are able to take a course in college.Others who have graduated k to 12 can get a job, such as others who do not have enough money to take the desired course in college, so others prefer to study up to k to 12 only.Critics say that its implementation could only worsen the issue on education in the country. Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, a known critic of the program, said that the country appears to be unprepared for K-12 due to inadequacy in resources, tools, classrooms, etc. (Reyes, 2015). Though some people cannot see its relevance, the K-12 program is still beneficial as it gives a better quality of education, provides job opportunities for high school graduates, and prepares the country for ASEAN Integration.The students are more concerned about this, they are having a hard time going to junior high school because of the lack of money, it is even more difficult for the student to choose a strand because of the thought of whether they will have more difficulty here Or not? extended they are still studying instead of graduating and can find a good job. K to 12 is one of the most important aspects implemented in education, because it is not only here that the talent and talent of a student can be honed but also that you manage properly how to do it.pa summarize naman po nito plss kaylangan lang​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>K to 12 is an educational program that provides additional knowledge and skills to students who have completed junior high school. It prepares them for adult responsibilities and further education or job opportunities. Critics believe that the program worsens educational issues due to inadequate resources. However, K to 12 provides better education quality, job opportunities, and prepares the country for ASEAN integration. Students face challenges, such as financial constraints and difficulty choosing a strand, but K to 12 helps in managing and honing their talents.</p><br />
