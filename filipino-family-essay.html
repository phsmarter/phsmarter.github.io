                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Filipino values are social constructs within Filipino culture which define that which is socially considered to be desirable. The Filipino value system describes "the commonly shared and traditionally established system of values underlying Filipino behavior" within the context of the larger Filipino cultural system. These relate to the unique assemblage of consistent ideologies, moral codes, ethical practices, etiquette and personal and cultural values that are promoted by Filipino society.[citation needed]</p><p></p><p>The formal study of Filipino values has been made difficult by the historical context of the literature in the field. The early scholarship about the Filipino value system lacked clear definitions and organizational frameworks, and were mostly written by foreigners during the Philippines' American colonial period.The latter half of the 20th century saw efforts to develop clearer definitions and properly contextualized frameworks, but many aspects of the scholarship require further clarification and consensus.</p><p></p><p>The distinct value system of Filipinos has generally been described as rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly Christianity) and commercial relationships.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>This study also intends to give policy recommendations on what the Philippines can do to become more resilient against COVID-19, especially with the plans of the government on modifying the Enhanced Community Quarantine to a General Community Quarantine. As PwC Philippines Chairman and Senior Partner Alexander Cabrera says, “We need to bring the economy back to life and we don’t need to die trying”. The pandemic is indeed a battle of every human and every unit of government, but to ultimately win this battle, the collective effort and solidarity of everyone are needed.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Effects of Covid 19 Pandemic to the Lives of Filipinos</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The world is in a very devastating situation right now. Millions of people are battling for their lives to survive in this pandemic disease. It's so frustrating that this virus has already taken thousands of lives of people all over the world. Doctors and nurses are trying to save those infected individuals. The government in some infected countries even conducted a lockdown and enhanced community quarantine to stop the spread of this virus. It feels like we are on a war- 'war between humans and the virus'. Instead of using rifles to protect us from the enemy, we are using masks and sanitizers. We don't know when a person is already infected unless being tested. It's so sad and scary to think that in every air we breath, we don't know if it is still safe or it already carries the virus. In every person we communicate personally, he/she might infect us without knowing. The pandemic has huge impact in the lives of filipinos. We are still a developing country and the pandemic is there to pull us down, to make us even poorer.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I think the greatest challenge of a Filipino parent is to build communication with their children. Specially in this generation where mostly of the teens ans and youngsters are used to modern way of life where everything is a lot easier than before thanks to the help of technology. It's harder for parents to relate with their children specially when it comes to social media.</p><p></p><p>2.There must be mutual kindness, respect and truthfulness among all family members. Each should be interested in the overall welfare and safety of the others. Children should listen to their parents and try to get the best education possible to prepare for their futures.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#Carry On Learners</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>For me, the hardest test as a Filipino parent is to work and be away from family to provide a good life and graduate their children. It is difficult to raise a family. But us, our Filipino parents, are doing what they can to give us the rights we need.They share responsibility according to the ability, age, and talent of each family member. They give responsibility to who they think is better and fit in the housework.<p></p><p><strong>HOPE IT HELP</strong></p><p><strong>#CARRYONLEARNING</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            11. Choose from the three types of essay: (A) informative, (B) Persuasive, (C) Argumentative and write an essay with not more 200 words using any of the topic listed below:(1) The Use of Modules in Teaching and Learning.(2)The Effect of Covid-19 Pandemic to the Lives of Filipinos.(3)Social Distancing can Save Lives.(4)The Impact of Online Learning to Students and their families.​</h2><br />
                        Answer:<br /><br />1. One of the benefits of using modules for instruction is the acquisition of better self-study or learning skills among students. Students engage themselves in learning the concepts presented in the module. They develop a sense of responsibility in accomplishing the tasks provided in the module. Module learning is effective and beneficial for students for many reasons. Firstly, it can allow students to plan ahead, as they will be fully aware of what topics will be covered in each module, as opposed to just guessing what will be taught next.<br /><br />2. COVID-19 has taken a heavy toll on rural livelihoods. Loss of income and job opportunities were overarching challenges in poor communities in the Philippines. Disaster-prone communities experienced more difficulties in coping with COVID-19 restrictions and its severe economic impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the loss of millions of lives, disrupted the global economy, and created secondary impacts on livelihoods, education, and mental health across the globe. No country or economic group has been immune to the direct impacts of the pandemic, but marginalized communities are particularly vulnerable to the secondary impacts including some public health measures like extended lockdowns.<br /><br />3. Social distancing is not only intended to reduce the total number of people who become infected with COVID-19 but to also help slow its spread, which could ultimately save lives. COVID-19 is a highly contagious viral respiratory infection. SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, spreads mainly through contaminated respiratory droplets that are emitted when infected people cough or sneeze and possibly when they breathe or speak. When these droplets escape the body they may land in a nearby person’s mouth, nose or eyes. They can travel about six feet before settling on a nearby surface. If you touch a contaminated surface then touch your mouth, nose or eyes, you can also become infected. In short, social distancing can help slow the spread of the infection so that public officials and healthcare workers have time to respond effectively to the developing situation.<br /><br />4. Parents may feel more connected to their children's day-to-day education. Parents may better understand what their children are learning. Parents may have a stronger understanding of their children's academic strengths and weaknesses. Disparities in digital literacy and online access among students, teachers, and parents meant that some kids faced big obstacles to just signing on to class. Students from traditionally underserved communities, those with learning disabilities, bilingual learners, and those with mental health conditions had unique challenges and found less access and support during remote learning. Some parents were less well-equipped to help their kids with school than others. Many families needed older kids to take on more household responsibilities or find jobs.<br /><br />— pili ka nalang po ng sagot niyo diyan. pa-brainliest na rin po, salamat :)<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A happy family is the foundation of a healthy and thriving society. It is a place where love, care, and support are constantly flowing, and everyone feels valued and appreciated. A happy family is not just about being together physically; it is also about emotional bonding, mutual respect, and the ability to solve problems together.</p><p></p><p>A happy family is a place where members communicate with each other openly and honestly. They share their thoughts and feelings without fear of being judged or criticized. In a happy family, each member takes the time to listen and understand the other's perspective, even if they don't agree with it.</p><p></p><p>In a happy family, members show love and care towards each other through simple gestures such as a warm hug, a kind word, or a thoughtful action. They celebrate each other's achievements, support each other in difficult times, and have fun together. They create memories through shared experiences and cherish these moments for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>In a happy family, parents play a crucial role in providing guidance, direction, and support to their children. They set boundaries, teach values, and provide a safe and nurturing environment for their children to grow and thrive. They also encourage their children to pursue their passions and dreams while instilling a sense of responsibility and discipline.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, a happy family is a source of joy and strength for its members. It provides a sense of belonging, security, and purpose. A happy family is not just a product of luck or chance; it requires effort, commitment, and love from all its members. When families are happy, they create a ripple effect that spreads positivity and happiness throughout the community.</p><br />

</p><p>Education minor and preparing for the “real world” of teaching that awaits me after May 10th
</p><p>.
</p><p>At this point, I’ve got some well-needed temporal, as well as practical, distance between myself
</p><p>and the English classes that were a staple of my time at Berry. Truth be told, I miss them. On a
</p><p>more relevant note, I’m thankful for them. In combination with my own extensive
</p><p>extracurricular studies of literature – e.g. my annual summer reading and research projects
</p><p>with books like Ulysses, Gravity’s Rainbow, and Infinite Jest – my English studies at Berry have
</p><p>not only given me knowledge that I am using right now in the high school classroom but also
</p><p>made me an overall better, more critical reader and writer. The discussions I’ve had (or rather,
</p><p>given my introverted nature, mostly observed) in class have shown me how to engage with
</p><p>others in good intellectual discussion and how a single text can be approached and analyzed
</p><p>from a variety of angles. The connections I’ve made with professors, both in and out of the
</p><p>classroom, have shown me much the same while giving me intellectual and personal role
</p><p>models to look up to. In short, my experience as an English major at Berry has been an
</p><p>enriching one, one that has prepared me both professionally and personally for the years after
</p><p>graduation.
</p><p>Coming to Berry in the fall of 2010, I knew from the start that I was going to be an
</p><p>English major and Secondary Education minor. It wasn’t until the spring of 2012, though, that I</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> Nowadays the family may be formed in a number of forms, rather than a heterosexual marriage. This includes single parenthood, live-in arrangements, LGBTQ marriages, and mixed families.  </p><p>                       Family relations are very close in the Philippines, and the family has historically been given more emphasis than individuals. Traditionally, families were tied together by fidelity, respect and intimacy. Family members are required to follow the guidelines laid down by the head of household rather than following their own private agendas. Extended families often live together and one child is often forced to live with the parents.T raditionally, all children have inherited property in the same manner that the house goes to the child who takes care of the parents.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Effects of Covid 19 Pandemic to the Lives of Filipinos</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Poster Explaination:</p><p></p><p>      The world is in a very devastating situation right now. Millions of people are battling for their lives to survive in this pandemic disease. It's so frustrating that this virus has already taken thousands of lives of people all over the world. Doctors and nurses are trying to save those infected individuals. The government in some infected countries even conducted a lockdown and enhanced community quarantine to stop the spread of this virus. It feels like we are on a war- 'war between humans and the virus'. Instead of using rifles to protect us from the enemy, we are using masks and sanitizers. We don't know when a person is already infected unless being tested. It's so sad and scary to think that in every air we breath, we don't know if it is still safe or it already carries the virus. In every person we communicate personally, he/she might infect us without knowing.  The pandemic has huge impact in the lives of filipinos. We are still a developing country and the pandemic is there to pull us down, to make us even poorer.  As a student, I just hope and wish to bring back everything to normal where we can freely enjoy every seconds of our lives.</p><br />
