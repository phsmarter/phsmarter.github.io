Specifically, the students are able to: (1) gain relevant and practical industrial skills under the guidance of industry experts and workers; (ii) appreciate the importance and application of the principles and theories taught in school, enhance their technical knowledge and skills; (iv) enrich their skills in communications and human relation; and (v) develop good work habits, attitudes, appreciation, and respect for work. These prepare them to meet the needs and challenges of employment or higher education after employment. Work Immersion provides the students with a venue to test themselves and apply what they have learned in a non-school scenario. The learners are not only able to apply their previous training but are also able to experience the social interactions in a work environment. Their experiences during work immersion will develop many skills and values that would help them as they transition from high school to real life.</p><p></p><p>To assure the achievement of the objectives of Work Immersion in the Philippines, the Department of Education issued DepEd Order No. 30, s. 2017 which serves as the basis in the implementation of work immersion in all Senior High Schools (SHSS). The policy serves to guide SHSS in: (i) creating flexible work immersion arrangement for their learners; (ii) providing options for work immersion that are relevant to learners' purposes and needs; (iii) organizing work immersion opportunities for learners that are consistent with the diverse human resource requirements for partner institutions for work immersion; and (iv) articulating the scope and limits of work immersion in the context of basic education when building relationships with work immersion partners. To assess the learners' performance during the Work Immersion, the Work Immersion Teacher and the Work Immersion Partner Institution Supervisor will jointly assess the learners' performance following DepEd Order No. 8, 2015.</p><p></p><p>As a Grade 12 student. I was given the chance to undergo the Work Immersion for a duration of two weeks. In preparation, I accomplished the needed requirements and documents first before I was qualified for the immersion. I was assigned to the Philippine National Police station. In our Work Immersion, I was able to experience the day-to-day activities of the PNP such as road checkpoint, flyer distribution, moral activity, community service, gun assembling, and earthquake drills. During this period, I learned a lot of things that helped me understand and appreciate the work of our police officers. I got first-hand experiences wherein I was able to apply and improve my prior knowledge and skills.</p><br />

                        <p>The present COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all of us. However, depending on our status as individuals and as members of society, the pandemic's impact and repercussions are perceived differently. While some people strive to adjust to working online, educating their children, and getting food through Instacart, others are forced to be infected in order to keep civilization running. Our many social identities and the social groupings to which we belong define our social inclusion and, as a result, our vulnerability to epidemics.Despite growing interest in understanding the relationship between social determinants of health and health outcomes, many academics, policymakers, elected officials, and others have been hesitant to name racism as one of the root causes of racial health inequities (for example, social, political, and historical). In some ways, the pandemic has served as a wake-up call.</p><br />

                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly affected the lives of millions of people around the world. My own experiences during this time have been a mix of challenging and unique.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant changes for me was transitioning to remote work. As someone who previously worked in an office environment, adjusting to working from home was a big change. While I appreciated the flexibility and the chance to avoid long commutes, I found it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Additionally, the lack of face-to-face interactions with colleagues and the physical separation from work made it difficult to stay motivated and focused.</p><p></p><p>Another impact of the pandemic was the strain it put on my mental health. Isolation from friends and family, the constant barrage of negative news, and the uncertainty of the future all took a toll on my well-being. However, I found ways to cope, such as practicing mindfulness and meditation, staying active, and connecting with loved ones virtually.</p><p></p><p>On the positive side, the pandemic provided me with an opportunity to reflect on my priorities and re-evaluate what was truly important to me. I became more appreciative of the small things in life, such as spending time outdoors, cooking meals with my family, and pursuing creative hobbies.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the pandemic has been a challenging time, but it has also presented opportunities for growth and self-reflection. As we continue to navigate this unprecedented time, I remain hopeful that we will emerge stronger and more resilient than ever before.</p><p></p><p>Scoring:</p><p>Content - 3/3</p><p>Organization - 3/3</p><p>Grammar and Mechanics - 3/3</p><p>Total - 9/9</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Peer reviews</strong> can have their positive and negative effects.  Therefore, these may or may not work for students.  The positive and negative effects are listed below for your reference.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Positive:
</strong></p><p>Peer review allows the students to discuss among themselves or to evaluate each other’s performances that have contributed in the success of their project, or research for example.  There will be an equal recognition of efforts and contributions such that those who worked so hard in the project will receive their due achievements.  Hence, peer review provides room for growth, understanding and collaboration among teams and members.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Negative:
</strong></p><p>Some of the students are undeniably dependent on their groupmates.  Once a peer review is taken into action, there will be unwanted reactions from those who may get low scores.  This may result to divided teams and hard feelings among the members.
</p><p>
</p><p>To sum it up, peer review may or may not work depending on the members of the team.  If everybody wishes to develop and to learn from each other, then this shall be a good platform for their team to grow better.  However, if everyone or some do not cooperate well in the review, then there will be no growth and learning.

                            18. Write an essay of about 200 (TWO HUNDRED) words on:
“Which is more beneficial to work: skills or experience? Why?”</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The debate on whether skills or experience is more beneficial for work has been ongoing for years. Both are vital and complementary aspects of career development, and it can be challenging to determine which is more valuable. However, it is essential to note that the answer to this question may vary depending on the industry, job type, and personal preferences of individuals.<p></p>Skills are the abilities and knowledge that individuals possess and are essential for performing a specific task or job. In contrast, experience is the practical knowledge gained by working in a particular field or industry over time. While skills may be more important in certain industries like technology, healthcare, or finance, experience is often valued more in fields like education, politics, or management.<p></p>Having the necessary skills can give job seekers a competitive edge in the job market. Employers are constantly seeking individuals with relevant skills for their company, and having the right skills can open doors to new job opportunities. On the other hand, experience allows individuals to understand the intricacies of a particular industry or company and develop a more nuanced perspective of the job they are performing.<p></p>In conclusion, both skills and                   experience are crucial for career development. While skills are essential for individuals to stand out in the job market, experience is valuable in developing a deeper understanding of an industry or company's inner workings. Ultimately, what is more beneficial to work depends on the individual and their career aspirations. It is necessary to strike a balance between the two to achieve success in any profession.<br />

</p><p>
</p><p>Child labor is one of the biggest problem in our country because a lot of young childrens work just to live. Working for their self/family is the only reason why they have something to eat and drink in order to live. Children's who experienced this couldn't enjoy their childhood and go to school because they need to work in order to live. In order to solve this problem in my own opinion, government should offer jobs/make more jobs in order for the parents of this children's to work and gave thier child's a good education and life. Also, government can give free tuitions for the children who can't afford to pay their school tuition. Hence, if this thing's happen then no more children's are going to work at such a young age in order to live.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Many people like me had to adjust to remote work and online schooling, while others had to cope with unemployment and financial hardship.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the pandemic has highlighted systemic inequalities and disparities in healthcare access, particularly for marginalized communities. The pandemic has also underscored the importance of science, research, and public health policies in addressing and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases.</p><p></p><p>However, amidst the challenges and difficulties, the pandemic has also shown the resilience and solidarity of us, humans.

While the pandemic has highlighted the vulnerabilities and inequalities in our systems, it has also showcased the strength and compassion of humanity. It is essential to continue to prioritize public health and work towards a more equitable and resilient future.</p><p></p><p></p>#CarryOnLearning Please mark me as Branliest &lt;3<br />

                        Experience During Covid-19 Pandemic<p>It’s been a rollercoaster ride since the <strong>pandemic </strong>entered the world. I had experienced being alone, frightened, and anxious about the virus that was spreading. It significantly impacts me since I am not used to living like this; being at home for almost two years is sad. It also affects my mental health; being worried sometimes if <strong>Covid-19</strong> could hit me. On the other hand, some positive things I learned in staying at home for a couple of years is to find something that will entertain you and make things that I am not unto before. I tried something new like gardening, painting, baking, and cooking, more time reading, and less on using my phone. </p>Some other key points:<p>The <strong>Covid-19 pandemic</strong> changed our lives as human beings. We always focus on our health and safety when going out. Using a face mask when going outdoors is the new normal, but it is for the sake of our lives. All the people wanted to go back where it used to be and beat the virus spreading through vaccines. And we do not lose hope that this <strong>pandemic </strong>will end soon. </p><p></p><p><strong>Experience in online classes during the pandemic: </strong>brainly.ph/question/8764049</p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><br />
