                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This page provides a bit of important historical context for the discussion and offers strategies for responding to the grammar-checking request in ways that respect the pedagogical philosophies of the writing center and the instructional needs of students writing in a foreign language. The list of strategies is followed by excerpts of coaching sessions, with annotations that illustrate how some of the strategies work in real conversations between writing coaches and multilingual writers.</p><p></p><p>1984: The triple whammy for multilingual writers</p><p>In 1984, several of the most influential texts in writing center history were published.

The content of students’ essays should be discussed only as much as necessary for accurate error correction.</p><strong>Answer:</strong><p></p><p>11.
