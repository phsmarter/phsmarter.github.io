                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Create your own? What would that even *mean*, considering that unless the speaker and listener share a model, communication becomes difficult? It’s one thing to select a model, and usually still workable if you make modifications to it (subverting tropes is a particular favorite of some advertising agencies). But the more impedance mismatch there is between your model and the listener’s model, the greater the danger of partial or complete failure of communication.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In other words, if your bank unilaterally decides to use mime and interpretive dance to explain its new fee structure, it’s almost certain to be the sort of train wreck that even Marcel Marceau wouldn’t be able to save. But if your bank asks whether you prefer interpretive dance, a smartphone app, or a webpage designed for laptops and desktops, that will probably increase the chances of them getting the information to you in the way you can best understand.</p><br />

When I was younger I would ask my mom to tell me the story of Jacob everyday. I love Jacob's story because of how faithful he is to the Father. Every morning when we wake up and before we go to sleep we would worship God's name, we'll sing some songs, pray, and also read stories.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Recognize that “your own communication model” isn’t very useful unless the person or people you’re communicating with is at least somewhat on board. Otherwise, there’s a very strong chance that the listeners start thinking “Is this a bad Powerpoint, or interpretive dance?” and not get what you’re doing.</p><p></p><p>Recognize that one communication model doesn’t work for all cases. The model I’d use for teaching in a classroom will be different than what I’d use while discusssing what to have for dinner.</p><p></p><p>Using the first two steps, come to the conclusion that the question itself needs a communication model that avoids creating an ambiguous and unclear question.</p><p></p><br />
