Agrarian Reform
Policies</h2><br />
                        <p>Agrarian reform has been a contentious issue in the Philippines for much of its history. The country's largely agricultural economy has been characterized by a small group of wealthy landowners controlling the majority of fertile land, while the vast majority of farmers have been left with little or no land of their own. This has led to widespread poverty and social unrest, as well as conflict between farmers and landowners.</p><p></p><p>The Philippine government has attempted to address this issue through various agrarian reform policies over the years. One of the first such policies was the Land Reform Act of 1955, which aimed to distribute land to tenant farmers and small landholders. However, this policy was largely ineffective and was later replaced by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) in 1988.</p><p></p><p>CARP was intended to be a comprehensive program that would provide land to millions of landless farmers, as well as support for land acquisition and development. However, the implementation of CARP has been slow and has faced numerous challenges, including resistance from landowners and a lack of resources.</p><p></p><p>Despite these challenges, agrarian reform remains an important issue in the Philippines, as it is closely tied to issues of social justice, economic development, and political stability. In recent years, the government has continued to try to address the issue through various initiatives, such as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program Extension with Reforms (CARPER) and the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022. However, much work remains to be done to ensure that all farmers in the country have access to the land and resources they need to thrive.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Reducing the complexity of a woman to her body or equating her character to the way she dresses has been a damaging way to deny women their humanity and to victim-shame survivors of sexual assault and rape. In public schools, young girls across the country have been kicked out of proms and suspended from school for wearing clothing that was deemed too “revealing” and distracting, sometimes in light of overly rigid dress codes.  Unsurprisingly, the common targets of such policing tend to be women and it’s sadly only a microcosm of a larger culture in which women’s bodies and clothing choices are perpetually policed and shamed.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>      Death is not in anyone's hands. Capital punishment or death penalty was given to a criminal deemed unfit to live by the state as a punishment for his / her heinous crimes. Death penalty was in effect since the beginning of the Spanish era, the Martial Law period, and Fidel Ramos and Estrada's time in the country. Death penalty should not be implemented in the Philippines because the judicial system is faulty and it is contrary to the catholic teachings. The judicial system in the Philippines is very slow, the due process of a case is not effective in the country because it takes too long to solve whereas most cases last for years before being processed. There are also too many errors in the system, these errors being having an inadequate lawyer represent the defendant, incomplete or lack of evidence, and unreliable witnesses. The death penalty should not even be imposed in the country where the justice system is currently imperfect and biased.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I choose "Pollution and resource depletion" as the area in need of attention in the Philippine business setting.</p><p></p><p>One specific Philippine company that has undergone an ethics issue with regard to pollution and resource depletion is the Marcopper Mining Corporation. The company was a joint venture between Placer Dome, a Canadian company, and the former dictator Ferdinand Marcos' cronies. </p><p></p><p>In 1996, a massive environmental disaster occurred when the tailings dam of the Marcopper Mining Corporation in Marinduque collapsed, spilling millions of tons of toxic waste into the Boac River and surrounding areas. The disaster affected the health and livelihoods of thousands of people, including farmers and fisherfolks who rely on the river and the ocean for their daily subsistence.</p><p></p><p>The nature of the ethics issue is the company's failure to take adequate measures to prevent the disaster and to address the environmental and social impacts of their operations. Despite warnings from environmental groups and local communities, the company continued to operate without proper waste management and containment facilities. The company also failed to disclose the full extent of the disaster, and the Canadian parent company, Placer Dome, initially denied responsibility for the environmental damage.</p><p></p><p>The Marcopper disaster highlights the urgent need for companies to prioritize environmental sustainability and social responsibility in their operations. It also underscores the importance of government regulation and enforcement to ensure that companies comply with environmental standards and protect the welfare of affected communities.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Philippine Economy</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>It was March 2020 when COVID-19 cases aroused here in the Philippines. Because of this rapid outbreak and  nationwide lockdowns imposed by the government have adversely impacted people’s livelihood which resulted in a sharp drop in employment, with estimates estimating that up to one million people lost their jobs as a result of the lockout. Furthermore, imposing a communal quarantine would, at the very least, result in a cumulative loss.The Philippines’ pandemic lockdown described as one of the longest, where 75% of the economy was shut down. The economy GDP shrank by 11.5 percent year on year in the third quarter of 2020 bouncing back with a smaller contraction from the 16.9 percent in the previous quarter. Improvement in the job market   has been reported as the economy continued to gradually reopen. From record level unemployment rate of 17.6% (equivalent to 7.288 million individuals) in April, it shrank to 9.7% (equivalent to 3.813 million jobless individuals) October. Metro Manila, the epicentre of the outbreak and which accounts for 37.5% of GDP, is a major concern during the pandemic, while the entire Luzon region accounts for about 70% of the country’s GDP. Sectors from retail, real estate, to manufacturing experienced serious challenges due to the enhanced community quarantine.
The jobs situation is expected to rebound in the coming quarters as quarantine restrictions continue to be relaxed, but that it would take some time for the labour market to go back to pre-pandemic levels.Which accounted Metro Manila for the most number of displaced workers.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>One current issue in the Philippines is the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the government's response to it. The Philippines has been heavily affected by the pandemic, with over 3 million confirmed cases and over 50,000 deaths as of February 2023.</p><p></p><p>The government's response to the pandemic has been criticized by some for being slow and inadequate. There have been issues with testing capacity, contact tracing, and the availability of hospital beds and medical supplies. There have also been controversies surrounding the procurement of vaccines and the distribution of aid to those in need.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, the government should prioritize the health and well-being of its citizens above all else, especially during a crisis like the pandemic. It is crucial that the government takes decisive and effective actions to control the spread of the virus and provide adequate support to those affected by it. This includes increasing testing and contact tracing capacity, ensuring the availability of medical supplies and hospital beds, and implementing effective vaccination programs. It is also important for the government to be transparent and accountable in its actions, and to work with the public and private sectors to address the challenges posed by the pandemic.</p><br />

                            27. Write a persuasive paragraph on any topic that interests you (any current issues or events in the Philippines). You may include either your assertion or a counterclaim on your chosen topic and cite textual evidences to support your opinion.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One current issue in the Philippines that I find particularly concerning is the state of the country's healthcare system. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the inadequacies of our healthcare infrastructure and the urgent need for reform. I firmly believe that the government must prioritize investing in healthcare to improve the country's overall well-being.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the Philippines lags behind its ASEAN neighbors in healthcare spending, with only 4.1% of its GDP allocated for health in 2021, compared to Thailand's 8.1% and Malaysia's 4.7%. This has resulted in a shortage of medical equipment and supplies, as well as an inadequate number of healthcare workers. As a result, the country struggled to contain the pandemic, with hospitals becoming overwhelmed and many Filipinos unable to access the care they needed.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the pandemic has revealed the significant disparities in healthcare access and outcomes across different regions and socioeconomic groups. According to a report by the World Health Organization, Filipinos from lower income groups are more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses and experience a higher burden of disease. This highlights the need for targeted healthcare interventions and policies that address these inequalities.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, improving the state of the Philippines' healthcare system is not just a matter of responding to the current pandemic but is an essential investment for the long-term well-being of the country. The government must allocate more resources and implement targeted policies to address the inadequacies and disparities in our healthcare infrastructure. </p><p></p><p></p><p>┌──── ∘°❉°∘ ────┐</p><p>     Hope it helps&lt;33  </p><p>└──── °∘❉∘° ────┘</p><p></p><p>      -angela8689-</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Oh my god, okay here's my opinion.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Many women have found themselves in this predicament, including young girls who should be enjoying their childhood. People are still blaming the women who were in these situations, which I find repulsive. They're simply being disrespectful and disregarding the women's feelings. Why do women have to cover their entire body just because men intend to do inappropriate things with it? Isn't it true that everyone should be able to wear anything they want? Instead of forcing women to wear baggy clothes, and long pants, why not just educate the men to have respect? Many lives have been ruined as a result of these acts, and they often go unpunished. It's always assumed that the woman is to blame. They believe they seduced the man to get his attention, and that he then got carried away and started doing inappropriate things, but this is far from the truth. Always believe the victim.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>A. Statement of the Topic: </p><p>What are the current economic issues in the Philippines and how are they affecting the country's development?</p><p></p><p>B. Rationale:</p><p>The Philippines is a developing country with a population of over 100 million people, and its economy has been experiencing both progress and setbacks. Some of the current issues facing the country include a high poverty rate, income inequality, unemployment, and underemployment, among others. These issues have the potential to hinder the country's progress and development, making it an interesting topic to explore.</p><p></p><p>C. Organization:</p><p>This paper will first review the relevant literature and identify the gaps that exist in current research. Then, economic theory will be applied to the issues at hand. The paper will also analyze the latest data and statistics, summarize the results, and present the findings. Finally, the conclusion will discuss the objectives of the paper.</p><p></p><p>Body of the Paper:</p><p></p><p>A. Related Literature:</p><p>Previous studies have highlighted the economic challenges in the Philippines, such as poverty, income inequality, and unemployment. However, there is a need to update the literature and explore the current state of these issues. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the poverty rate, causing more people to lose their jobs and income. Another gap in the literature is the lack of attention to underemployment, which is a prevalent issue in the country.</p><p></p><p>B. Application of Economic Theory:</p><p>The economic theory can be applied to explain the issues facing the Philippines. For instance, the poverty rate can be explained by the lack of access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities, among others. Income inequality can be attributed to the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities. The high unemployment and underemployment rates can be linked to the country's inadequate infrastructure, low productivity, and poor business environment.</p><p></p><p>C. Analysis of Data:</p><p>According to the latest data, the poverty rate in the Philippines increased from 16.6% in 2018 to 23.1% in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Income inequality remains a significant concern, with the top 10% of the population earning more than 40% of the total income. The unemployment rate increased from 5.1% in 2019 to 7.1% in 2020, and underemployment reached 14.4%. The pandemic has also caused a decline in the country's GDP growth rate, which was -9.6% in 2020.</p><p></p><p>Results and Findings:</p><p>The analysis shows that the economic issues in the Philippines have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a significant setback in the country's development. The poverty rate, income inequality, unemployment, and underemployment are some of the challenges that the country needs to address to achieve sustainable development.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The objective of this paper was to examine the current economic issues in the Philippines and their impact on the country's development. The analysis reveals that these issues are a hindrance to the country's progress, and there is a need for policies and interventions that can address them effectively. The government needs to prioritize economic growth and job creation to reduce poverty and improve the standard of living for all Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>References:</p><p>- Philippine Statistics Authority.
