                            8. Write a paragraph about the topic "bullying" ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>bullying</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Bullying is when someone is rude or mean to another person. The people who bully other people are called bullies. Anybody can be bullied, even a group of people. There are many different kinds of bullying. Bullying does not always mean hitting people. It can also be things that people say. </p><p><strong>Bullying</strong> includes when people see what happens, but they don't do anything about it. When people who see bullying know what to do and they do it, they can help make a bad situation better.</p><p>It's also <strong>bullying</strong> when other people hide it from those who can help (teachers, bosses), when other people see it but ignore it, or when a person helps the bully to do it without getting in trouble.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>When someone or many people scare, abuse or dominate other person, it is called bullying. This can happen in school, office, street or at home. Such behaviour is a habit of some people and so they do it again and again. Bullying is very common for children in schools.</p><p></p><p> “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse, and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.”</p><p></p><p>Bullying can be verbal in which children make fun of others, call them by bad names, spread rumours about them. It can be physical in which they hit others or destroy their things. It can also happen on phone or computer when someone uses dirty language or send bad pictures or messages. Intentionally making someone feel alone is also bullying. Bullying is growing a lot in our society nowadays. It affects students and people badly and many times it also affects their health. One loses confidence when one is bullied. The person starts being alone and stops talking to others. It affects his studies and his health. Some children start suffering from depression and they can also commit suicide.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            10. identify the goal of the research about gender based bullying​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>School bullying continues to be one of the main challenges for the education community. Current research indicates that Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Transsexual, and other LGBT+ people suffer the highest rates of bullying, while other studies suggest that this bullying does not occur based on the victim’s actual sexual orientation or gender identity, but because they do not fit into the traditional gender roles. The aim of the present study was to carry out a meta-analytical study on the prevalence of gender-based bullying against LGBT+ schoolchildren and adolescents in Spain. Methods: The review was carried out following the recommendations of the PRISMA group and allowing us to identify a total of 24 studies. All of these studies were published since 2008, and most of them conducted cross-sectional survey-type research. It was also found that the instrument used to assess bullying varied greatly among studies, resulting in an enormous heterogeneity of research on this topic. Different meta-analyses were carried out according to the profile of involvement in bullying: victimisation, perpetration, and observation. In addition, three target populations were detected in the victimisation research: the general population, pre-identified bullying victims reporting the reasons behind the victimisation, and LGBT+ people. Results: The meta-analyses conducted with R have estimated the prevalence of observation of gender-based school bullying in Spain at 77.3%, perpetration at 13.3%, and victimisation at 8.6% among the general population. When the research focuses on previously identified victims, the rate was 3.6%, while if LGBT+ people are approached directly, the percentage increases to 51%. Conclusions: These rates reveal the need to develop specific preventive strategies in schools. Greater awareness of affective-sexual diversity and respect for those who do not conform to traditional gender roles should be promoted.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>As a girl.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Quality as the amount of technology in the world increases, so does the number of students who are cyber bullied. Cyber bullying is often anonymous and occurs over the internet. Because there is usually no way to prove a person as being the abuser, cyber bullying has become extremely hard to fight. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the psychological effects cyber bullying has on high school aged teenagers.</p><p>This is due to the constant advancement of technology and the extensive possession of such technologic devices by youths. What makes cyber bullying an exceptionally disastrous event in the students life is that the bully can remain anonymous, can contact the victim at any time, and the victimizer makes the victim feel like he or she has no control over the situation. The power that the perpetrator seems to hold makes the victim feel that he or she is unable to defend their self. This lack of control can cause student to avoid school, avoid school functions, and to abstain from normal social activities. Sometime the bullying is so intense, cruel and unrelenting, that the student will revert to suicide as a means of escaping the …show more content…</p><p>Questions about self injury, cutting, burning, and bruising on purpose, were also asked. Along with that, inquiries were made on the sociodemographics, gender, grade, race and ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Finally, students were asked about their grade average, they self reported grades as letter grades. It was found that over one third of students felt they were being bullied in any way. Over six percent of students being bullied were being cyber bullied only. Over sixteen percent were being bullied at school only. Ten percent of students were being bullied both at school and over the internet. In this study, cyber bullying was higher in females and school bullying was about the same for both genders. Among non- heterosexually identified student both types of bullying were more common than for students who were heterosexually identified. Ethnicity and race did not play a part in bullying. Both types of bullying had a large impact on the students who were victimized; from lower school performance, to feelings of depression, to suicidal feelings. These impacts were the most prevalent in students who</p><p></p><br />
