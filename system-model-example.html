                                            Introduction to Online Collaborative The growth of online social networking has created new opportunities for collaboration. How can we ensure that everyone is able to make full use of it? In line of work, we will explore the use of user role assignments as a way to encourage participation in online collaborative. A design for such a roles system to be built into an online collaborative environment that uses the idea of state-space search as a model for problem solving. The simultaneousness of both constructivist ways to deal with learning and the improvement of the Internet has prompted the advancement of a specific type of constructivist educating, initially called PC intervened correspondence (CMC), or arranged leaming. Another vital variable is that in the OCL model, talk gatherings are not an expansion or supplement to center showing materials, for example, course books, recorded addresses, or content in a LMS, however are the center segment of the instructing. Course books, readings and different assets are upheld the exchange, not the other route round. This is a key outline guideline, and clarifies why regularly teachers or coaches grumble, in more "customary" online courses, that understudies don't take an interest in examinations. Frequently this is on the grounds that where online dialogs are auxiliary to more instructive educating, or are not purposely outlined and figured out how to prompt learning development, understudies see the discourses as discretionary or additional work, since they have no immediate effect on evaluations or appraisal. example and meaning ​</a>

Schrodinger formulated a mathematical equation that describes the behaviour of the electron. 4. The quantum mechanical model of the atom describes the atom as having a nucleus at the center around which the electrons move. 5. The distribution of electrons in the different atomic orbitals is called electron configuration. 6. Atomic orbital serves as the "house" of the electron. 7. The further the energy level from the nucleus, the higher the energy. 8. Atoms are made up subatomic particles namely protons, neutrons, and electrons. 9. An atom with 32 electrons has 4 energy levels. 10. Every sublevel has fixed number of atomic orbitals. 11. This atomic orbital is the place where protons are most probably found. 12. The way in which electrons are distributed in the different orbitals around the nucleus is called the atomic orbitals. 13. An example of electron configuration is 1s22s22p for hydrogen atom.​</a>

                            8. Introduction to Online Collaborative The growth of online social networking has created new opportunities for collaboration. How can we ensure that everyone is able to make full use of it? In line of work, we will explore the use of user role assignments as a way to encourage participation in online collaborative. A design for such a roles system to be built into an online collaborative environment that uses the idea of state-space search as a model for problem solving. The simultaneousness of both constructivist ways to deal with learning and the improvement of the Internet has prompted the advancement of a specific type of constructivist educating, initially called PC intervened correspondence (CMC), or arranged leaming. Another vital variable is that in the OCL model, talk gatherings are not an expansion or supplement to center showing materials, for example, course books, recorded addresses, or content in a LMS, however are the center segment of the instructing. Course books, readings and different assets are upheld the exchange, not the other route round. This is a key outline guideline, and clarifies why regularly teachers or coaches grumble, in more "customary" online courses, that understudies don't take an interest in examinations. Frequently this is on the grounds that where online dialogs are auxiliary to more instructive educating, or are not purposely outlined and figured out how to prompt learning development, understudies see the discourses as discretionary or additional work, since they have no immediate effect on evaluations or appraisal. example and meaning ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>The introduction emphasizes the growing importance of online collaborative learning and the need to ensure that it is accessible to all. It is proposed that user role assignments be used to encourage participation in online collaborative environments. In addition, the article discusses the use of constructivist teaching methods and the role of discussion forums in the OCL model, which prioritizes discussions over traditional teaching materials. The article emphasizes the importance of designing and integrating online discussions with course material to ensure their effectiveness and impact on learning.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>any amount</strong></p><p><strong>09163917783</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

why is the model have only two main involved 
factors (Household and Firm)?
2. Explain the circular flow model by providing 
concrete examples of each factor involved in the 
model.3. What economic system is appropriate in the 
Philippines? Would it be possible to use the 
command or mixed economic system? 
</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1The circular flow of the economy basically involves two sectors, that is the households who are the providers of the various factors of production and the firms who use the factors of production to come up with goods and services. The firms spend their income on the factors of production and use these factors to priduce goods and serices. Afterwards, the households will use the income from the firms to purchse the goods and services and the process continues until a circular flow is attained. This circular flow also does not involve any external forces like the government policies nor the imports and exports which are taking place within and without the country.</p><p></p><p>2.The circular flow model demonstrates how money moves through society. Money flows from producers to workers as wages and flows back to producers as payment for products. In short, an economy is an endless circular flow of money.</p><p></p><p>That is the basic form of the model, but actual money flows are more complicated. Economists have added in more factors to better depict complex modern economies. These factors are the components of a nation's gross domestic product (GDP) or national income. For that reason, the model is also referred to as the circular flow of income model.</p><p></p><p>3.The Philippines has a mixed economic system which includes a variety of private freedom, combined with centralized economic planning and government regulation. Philippines is a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The theory of social systems has been contested as a part of sociology. Social order can be expected to emerge as an expectation that is communicated. A communication can be provided with meaning and meaning may evolve into codified meaning. The social system can thus be considered as developing in layers of communication among reflexive actors. At the interfaces between systems theory, communication theory and evolution theory puzzles emerge which can also be formulated as analytical and empirical questions. The mathematical theory of communication can be used for the clarification of the relations among these different perspectives, since a message is expected to contain information</p><br />

SCIENCE 9 QUARTER 2 MODULE 1 (WRITTEN WORK 1) DIRECTION: Write TRUE if the statement is correct and FALSE if the statement is wrong. 1.Bohr's atomic model describes the atom like a solar system.2.An electron can jump to a higher energy level by gaining energy and return to a lower energy level by releasing energy in the form of light. 3. Schrodinger formulated a mathematical equation that describes the behaviour of the electron. 4. The quantum mechanical model of the atom describes the atom as having a nucleus at the center around which the electrons move. 5. The distribution of electrons in the different atomic orbitals is called electron configuration. 6. Atomic orbital serves as the "house" of the electron. 7. The further the energy level from the nucleus, the higher the energy. 8. Atoms are made up subatomic particles namely protons, neutrons, and electrons. 9. An atom with 32 electrons has 4 energy levels. 10. Every sublevel has fixed number of atomic orbitals. 11. This atomic orbital is the place where protons are most probably found. 12. The way in which electrons are distributed in the different orbitals around the nucleus is called the atomic orbitals. 13. An example of electron configuration is 1s22s22p for hydrogen atom.​</h2><br />
