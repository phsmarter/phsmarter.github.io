                    <p>Case No. 3: SEATTLE AMUSEMENTS CORPORATION Seattle Amusements Corporation places electronic games and other amusement devices in supermarkets and similar outlets throughout the country. Seattle Amusements is investigating the purchase of a new electronic game called The Coven. The manufacturer will sell 20 games to Seattle Amusements for a total price of Php 180,000. Seattle Amusements has determined the following additional information about the game. a. The game would have a 5-year useful life and a negligible salvage value. The company uses a straight-line depreciation. b. The game would replace other games that are unpopular and generating little revenue. These other games would be sold for a total of Php 30,000. c. Seattle Amusements estimates that The Coven would generate annual incremental revenues of Php 20,000 (total for all 20 games). Annual incremental out-of-pocket costs would be (in total) maintenance Php 50,000 and insurance, Php 10,000. In addition, Seattle Amusements would have to pay a commission of 40% of total revenues to the supermarkets and other outlets in which the games were placed. Required: (Income taxes ignored) 1. Prepare a contribution format income statement showing the net operating income each year from The Coven. 2. Compute the simple rate of return on The Coven. Will the game be purchased if Seattle Amusements accepts any project with a simple rate of return greater than 14%? 3. Compute the payback period on The Coven. If the company accepts any investment with a payback period of less than three years, will the game be purchased?​</p>

Weathering and erosion are very slow processes. Geologists believe the Colorado River has been flowing through the Grand Canyon for at least 17 million years, and it has been gradually shaping the canyon this entire time. The flowing water of the river and its tributaries has carved away at the rock of the Colorado Plateau, creating the amazing sight that is seen nowadays.2. Excessive use of gadgets negatively affects children's health. For instance, prolonged exposure to the screen causes eye strain. Children experience dry, itchy and irritated eyes when they spend hours using the computer, tablet or cellular phone. Too much use of gadgets also changes sleeping patterns of kids who play games or surf the internet late into the night. Studies reveal that exposure to tech gadgets changes brain activity that disturb sleep patterns. Reports also show that too much use of gadgets cause obesity. Many children do not wish to go out anymore because they enjoy playing games in their devices. The problem is that they do engage in physical activities anymore, so they end up obese. With these negative effects, education experts advise parents to regulate or control gadget use.3. Sun exposure is linked to skin cancer. This is the most common type of cancer in the world. It's best to limit your time spent in the sun. Be sure to wear protective clothing and hats when you are outside. Use sunscreen year-round on exposed skin, like your face and hands. It protects your skin and helps prevent skin cancer. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB rays. It should be at least an SPF 15. Do not sunbathe or use tanning booths.4. The cats' behavior of cleaning their body with their tongue serves several purposes: It helps cats to tone down their scent so they can avoid predators, it cools them down, it promotes blood flow, and it distributes natural oils evenly around their coat, allowing them to stay warm and dry. Grooming also serves as a sign of affection between two cats, and it's thought that saliva contains enzymes that serve as a natural antibiotic for wounds.5. Maintaining space between yourself and others is a best practice and is one of the best tools to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus. People can spread the virus without being sick or knowing they are sick, so it is important to maintain social distance from others whenever possible. Physical distancing is required on USM's main campus and in satellite locations to limit exposure to the COVID-19 virus and slow its spread.​</a>

                            1. Case No. 3: SEATTLE AMUSEMENTS CORPORATION Seattle Amusements Corporation places electronic games and other amusement devices in supermarkets and similar outlets throughout the country. Seattle Amusements is investigating the purchase of a new electronic game called The Coven. The manufacturer will sell 20 games to Seattle Amusements for a total price of Php 180,000. Seattle Amusements has determined the following additional information about the game. a. The game would have a 5-year useful life and a negligible salvage value. The company uses a straight-line depreciation. b. The game would replace other games that are unpopular and generating little revenue. These other games would be sold for a total of Php 30,000. c. Seattle Amusements estimates that The Coven would generate annual incremental revenues of Php 20,000 (total for all 20 games). Annual incremental out-of-pocket costs would be (in total) maintenance Php 50,000 and insurance, Php 10,000. In addition, Seattle Amusements would have to pay a commission of 40% of total revenues to the supermarkets and other outlets in which the games were placed. Required: (Income taxes ignored) 1. Prepare a contribution format income statement showing the net operating income each year from The Coven. 2. Compute the simple rate of return on The Coven. Will the game be purchased if Seattle Amusements accepts any project with a simple rate of return greater than 14%? 3. Compute the payback period on The Coven. If the company accepts any investment with a payback period of less than three years, will the game be purchased?​</h2><br />

                            4. Read the selections carefully and identify the general statement and specific details. Then, apply any of the formats in citing textual evidence.1. Weathering and erosion are very slow processes. Geologists believe the Colorado River has been flowing through the Grand Canyon for at least 17 million years, and it has been gradually shaping the canyon this entire time. The flowing water of the river and its tributaries has carved away at the rock of the Colorado Plateau, creating the amazing sight that is seen nowadays.2. Excessive use of gadgets negatively affects children's health. For instance, prolonged exposure to the screen causes eye strain. Children experience dry, itchy and irritated eyes when they spend hours using the computer, tablet or cellular phone. Too much use of gadgets also changes sleeping patterns of kids who play games or surf the internet late into the night. Studies reveal that exposure to tech gadgets changes brain activity that disturb sleep patterns. Reports also show that too much use of gadgets cause obesity. Many children do not wish to go out anymore because they enjoy playing games in their devices. The problem is that they do engage in physical activities anymore, so they end up obese. With these negative effects, education experts advise parents to regulate or control gadget use.3. Sun exposure is linked to skin cancer. This is the most common type of cancer in the world. It's best to limit your time spent in the sun. Be sure to wear protective clothing and hats when you are outside. Use sunscreen year-round on exposed skin, like your face and hands. It protects your skin and helps prevent skin cancer. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB rays. It should be at least an SPF 15. Do not sunbathe or use tanning booths.4. The cats' behavior of cleaning their body with their tongue serves several purposes: It helps cats to tone down their scent so they can avoid predators, it cools them down, it promotes blood flow, and it distributes natural oils evenly around their coat, allowing them to stay warm and dry. Grooming also serves as a sign of affection between two cats, and it's thought that saliva contains enzymes that serve as a natural antibiotic for wounds.5. Maintaining space between yourself and others is a best practice and is one of the best tools to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus. People can spread the virus without being sick or knowing they are sick, so it is important to maintain social distance from others whenever possible. Physical distancing is required on USM's main campus and in satellite locations to limit exposure to the COVID-19 virus and slow its spread.​</h2><br />
