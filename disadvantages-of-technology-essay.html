                                            Essay 1: Importance of Education Education is a process that involves the transfer of knowledge, habits and skills from one generation to another through teaching, research and training it can be in a formal or informal setting. Formal education involves institutionalized learning based on a curriculum In today's society, education and learning play an indispensable role in shaping the lives of individuals and the society at large. The most effective way of boosting economic growth, reducing poverty and improving people's health is by investing in education. Human labor is essential for economic growth. A highly educated labor force further stimulates economic growth. Additionally, a highly educated labor force can easily adapt to new working environments and conditions. In view of that, it is evident that education serves as the driving force for innovation of new products and services. Educated workers exchange ideas in the work place and come up with new ideas that help in the growth of the economy. Education reduces poverty in a number of ways. One way is by creating employment opportunities for educated people. Through employment, one is able to afford a decent living. Education helps to increase economic security, create income opportunities and improve livelihoods of the economically disadvantaged by providing sustainable environmental management mechanisms. Education further alleviates poverty through skills acquired in the learning process. Skills such as carpentry, plumbing and masonry are relevant in non-formal economies. One can acquire these skills through technical and vocational training Educated people are health conscious and live longer than their counterparts because they engage in healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and going for medical check-ups. By investing in education, one will also be investing in their health. Education serves to create room for technological advancements in the field of medicine and agriculture. Advanced technology used for conducting surgery has replaced traditional methods. This has seen an improvement in people's general health and an increased life expectancy. Most developing countries have a low life expectancy compared to developed countries. This can be attributed to high illiteracy levels present in developing countries. This translates to poor health and poor eating habits. In conclusion, education is the only means of alleviating poverty, improving people's health and increasing economic growth. Improving literacy levels in marginalized societies will go a long way in improving human living standards   SUMMARIZES​</a>

Essay 1: Importance of Education smmibe Education is a process that involves the transfer of knowledge, habits and skills from one generation to another through teaching, research and training. It can be in a formal or informal setting. Formal education involves institutionalized learning based on a curriculum. In today's society, education and learning play an indispensable role in shaping the lives of individuals and the society at large. The most effective way of boosting economic growth, reducing poverty and improving people's health is by investing in education. Human labor is essential for economic growth. A highly educated labor force further stimulates economic growth. Additionally, a highly educated labor force can easily adapt to new working environments and conditions. In view of that, it is evident that education serves as the driving force for innovation of new products and services. Educated workers exchange ideas in the work place and come up with new ideas that help in the growth of the economy. Education reduces poverty in a number of ways. One way is by creating employment opportunities for educated people. Through employment, one is able to afford a decent living. Education helps to increase economic security, create income opportunities and improve livelihoods of the economically disadvantaged by providing sustainable environmental management mechanisms. Education further alleviates poverty through skills acquired in the learning process. Skills such as carpentry, plumbing and masonry are relevant in non-formal economies. One can acquire these skills through technical and vocational training. Educated people are health conscious and live longer than their counterparts because they engage in healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and going for medical check ups. By investing in education, one will also be investing in their health. Education serves to create room for technological advancements in the field of medicine and agriculture. Advanced technology used for conducting surgery has replaced traditional methods. This has seen an improvement in people's general health and an increased life expectancy. Most developing countries have a low life expectancy compared to developed countries. This can be attributed to high illiteracy levels present in developing countries. This translates to poor health and poor eating habits. In conclusion, education is the only means of alleviating poverty, improving people's health and increasing economic growth. Improving literacy levels in marginalized societies will go a long way in improving human living standards.​</a>

                            1. essay about argumentative essay about technology. advantage and disadvantages of having a technology in the campus​</h2><br />
                        <p>Technology has become an indispensable part of our daily lives, including in the field of education. With the rapid advancement of technology, schools and universities have integrated technology into their curriculum and campus infrastructure. However, the use of technology in the campus has been the subject of debate, as it has both advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will argue for and against the use of technology in the campus.</p><p></p><p>One of the major advantages of technology in the campus is its ability to enhance the learning experience. With the help of technology, students can access a vast array of educational resources, including online libraries, educational videos, and interactive software. This allows for a more personalized and interactive learning experience. Moreover, technology enables collaboration between students and teachers through online discussion forums and video conferencing.</p><p></p><p>Another advantage of technology in the campus is its ability to increase efficiency. With the use of technology, students can submit their assignments online, eliminating the need for printing and physically submitting papers. This saves time and resources for both students and teachers. In addition, technology can be used to automate administrative tasks, such as attendance tracking and grade recording, reducing the workload of teachers.</p><p></p><p>However, the use of technology in the campus also has its disadvantages. One of the major drawbacks is its potential to distract students from their studies. With the widespread use of social media and other entertainment applications, students may become more interested in browsing the internet than focusing on their studies. Moreover, the over-reliance on technology may lead to a decline in traditional skills, such as handwriting and critical thinking.</p><p></p><p>Another disadvantage of technology in the campus is its cost. The integration of technology requires a significant financial investment, including the purchase of hardware and software, as well as the cost of maintenance and upgrades. This may not be feasible for all educational institutions, particularly those in developing countries or those with limited resources.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while technology has brought significant advantages to the campus, it is not without its drawbacks. Therefore, it is important for educational institutions to strike a balance between the use of technology and traditional teaching methods, and to be mindful of its potential impact on students and the learning process. The proper integration of technology in the campus can enhance the learning experience and increase efficiency, but it must be done in a way that is responsible and sustainable.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>do you believe that the evolution of modern technology has disadvantages? why or why not?</p> Advantages- the evolution of technology is beneficial to humans for several reasons. At the medical level, technology can help treat more sick people and consequently save many lives and combat very harmful viruses and bacteria.<br /><br />The invention of the computer was a very important point. Communication is thus enhanced, and companies can communicate more easily with foreign countries. Research is also simplified.<br /><br />Disadvantages- the evolution of modern technology has disadvantages, for example, dependence on new technology. Man no longer needs to think. Even if the calculator is a good invention, man no longer makes mental calculation and no longer works his memory. The decline of human capital implies an increase in unemployment. In some areas, devices can replace the human mind.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Advantages</p><p></p><p>Modern technology is mostly seen as a blessing for learners. The widespread use of mobile devices and the internet have made learning easier.  </p><p>Here are a few advantages of modern technology in education:</p><p><strong>•</strong><strong>Independent learning has become easier and more effective</strong></p><p>The internet can provide you with information in any field. No matter what you need to know, you can easily find that online. You can not always trust the data and the source, but you can still use them as educational resources. Students can use the internet without the assistance of their teachers or parents.</p><p><strong>•</strong><strong>Good </strong><strong>preparations</strong><strong> for the future</strong></p><p>It is pretty obvious that learning in the future will be technology-based. Students who are using technology now will find it easy to compete in the future. That is why students should be encouraged to collaborate and communicate using digital technology. </p><p>•<strong>Modern technology has lowered tuition and textbook prices</strong></p><p>More resources are available now, and those resources are easily accessible. Students are now less dependent on textbooks, and as a result, the cost of textbooks has decreased. Many learners are not buying physical textbooks. Rather, they are now using e-books. </p><p><strong>and </strong><strong>etc.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><p></p><p>It is also important to remember that modern technology is not an unmixed blessing for students. The main allegation against digital devices is that these devices are making students lazy. Now we are going to discuss the disadvantages of modern technology.</p><p></p><p><strong>•</strong><strong>Lack of interest in hard work</strong></p><p>Due to the availability of all types of information online, many students are now becoming lazy. They no longer want to study the hard way. Some students even do not attend classes, mistakenly thinking that everything can be found online. They think that teachers are no longer necessary.</p><p><strong>•</strong><strong>Misuse of technology</strong></p><p>Mobile devices, computers, and other technologies are usually seen as tools of entertainment, not of education. Textbooks are known as just tools for learning. This is the teaching of consumerism, and it has a negative effect on students. </p><p><strong>•</strong><strong>Instructional challenges</strong></p><p>Professors and teacher, if not trained regularly, often fail to instruct their students. Teachers who are used to teach in traditional methods sometimes cannot stay abreast with technology. Some teachers shun technology because they do not find it convenient to use technology.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Electronic businesses have become extremely popular in the recent years. More and more people prefer to buy and sell products and services online. It is rather important for those, who are in e-commerce business, to realize all advantages and disadvantages of performing their business over the internet or other computer networks. In the modern technological era business leaders have to be accustomed to such issues as internet marketing, electronic funds transfer, online transaction processing, supply chain management, automated collection data systems, inventory management systems and electronic data interchange (Kelly, 2005). Using a SWOT analysis will give the opportunity to improve better methods and strategies while conducting an e-commerce business. That is why it is essential to be well aware of the appropriate information, knowledge, experience and great desire to succeed in business, no matter whether it is small or big. The understanding of the main principles and techniques of conducting an e-commerce business will give the advantage to increase the company`s revenues and incomes.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Electronic </strong><strong>Business</strong></p><p></p><p>Conducting electronic business online has advantages and disadvantages. To identify these features, the business owners are prone using SWOT analysis.. The internal strengths of my business were a wide range of capabilities it could have in future, because of the innovations and technology it could provide in the business operation. Experience, knowledge and data are real strengths to develop it into well-established. The personnel possess professional experience, deep knowledge in the marketing environment and professional skills. The company`s data is a valuable source that can be implemented into achieving its objectives. As to the weaknesses, lack of capabilities may be identified because of the competition in the market, where other e-commerce companies are selling the same products and services. It is essential to overcome the lack of competitive gap. While estimating the company`s opportunities, it has become obvious that it reaches the target markets making a good profit. Innovation and technology development is a good tendency that is currently occurs in the business process. Making e-commerce business globally gives a great opportunity to open new markets and find new customers. New contracts and partners are rather threatening to e-commerce. It is hard to identify what kind of partners and customers could be met online. Sometimes new contracts do not give desired results and profit. Loss of resources is another threat. It is not easy to find new sources of resources, thus, e-commerce may lose the money. The research reported that it is very important to identify all these positive and negative factors while achieving the company`s objectives (Kotler, 2009). </p><p></p><br />

Technology help us to connect to our family, it help us to get some news and be updated to what’s happening in the world. However, despite of these advantages, there’s a lot of disadvantages. Example is people depend too much on social medias and do not check if it the news is reliable. Also, people are more focused in social media and a lot of people are getting stressed in using technology. Most of the students are always on their gadget and do not mind the school works they have. Always remember that it’s okay to use technology but remember that we also have limits. <br /><br /> hope this helps!<br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Technology has been a part of our lives and it plays a crucial role in almost everything that we do nowadays. Using it on our daily basis definitely has an advantage for us because it makes our work easier and faster. It's easy for us to communicate with our loved ones and friends with the aide of gadgets and we can always look for information about something that we don't know. In addition, having technology keep us to be always informed and updated especially now that we are in the middle of a pandemic, may it be updates in the cases of COVID-19 or news about the current happenings worldwide. However, having technology still have disadvantages, for me, having these makes us more invested to social media and it's like it limits our personal connection with our peers and family. We don't spend enough time with our families anymore because we're all busy clicking the keyboard and facing the screens of our gadgets. It makes us unsocial and we became pretenders behind our social media life. As a 21st century student, it affects me in a sense that it's easier for me to research for informations about a certain topic that I don't understand and I can always look for those anytime, with different sources, I can learn many things. Technology really helped me a lot especially now that our situation is hard, but no matter how it helped me a lot, it's still important to use it properly. As a student, we should use technology in a way that we could gain knowledge and could improve our skills, we shouldn't take it for granted just because we have an access. </p><br />

                        <p>Advantages</p><p></p><p>Modern technology is mostly seen as a blessing for learners. The widespread use of mobile devices and the internet have made learning easier.</p><p></p><p>Here are a few advantages of modern technology in education:</p><p></p><p>• Independent learning has become easier and more effective</p><p></p><p>The internet can provide you with information in any field. No matter what you need to know, you can easily find that online. You can not always trust the data and the source, but you can still use them as educational resources. Students can use the internet without the assistance of their teachers or parents.</p><p></p><p>• Good preparations for the future</p><p></p><p>It is pretty obvious that learning in the future will be technology-based. Students who are using technology now will find it easy to compete in the future. That is why students should be encouraged to collaborate and communicate using digital technology.</p><p></p><p>• Modern technology has lowered tuition and textbook prices</p><p></p><p>More resources are available now, and those resources are easily accessible. Students are now less dependent on textbooks, and as a result, the cost of textbooks has decreased. Many learners are not buying physical textbooks. Rather, they are now using e-books.</p><p></p><p>and etc.</p><p></p><p>Disadvantages</p><p></p><p>It is also important to remember that modern technology is not an unmixed blessing for students. The main allegation against digital devices is that these devices are making students lazy. Now we are going to discuss the disadvantages of modern technology.</p><p></p><p>• Lack of interest in hard work</p><p></p><p>Due to the availability of all types of information online, many students are now becoming lazy. They no longer want to study the hard way. Some students even do not attend classes, mistakenly thinking that everything can be found online. They think that teachers are no longer necessary.</p><p></p><p>• Misuse of technology</p><p></p><p>Mobile devices, computers, and other technologies are usually seen as tools of entertainment, not of education. Textbooks are known as just tools for learning. This is the teaching of consumerism, and it has a negative effect on students.</p><p></p><p>• Instructional challenges</p><p></p><p>Professors and teacher, if not trained regularly, often fail to instruct their students. Teachers who are used to teach in traditional methods sometimes cannot stay abreast with technology. Some teachers shun technology because they do not find it convenient to use technology.</p><br />
