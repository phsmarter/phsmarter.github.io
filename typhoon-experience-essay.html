After reading the text, copy the graphic organizer below in your pape and supply the missing items. CAUSE EFFECTS Global warming is one of the major environmental issues facing the world today. It refers to the dramatic increase in the annual average global surface temperature of the earth. Many scientists predict that this rapid change in temperature will most likely bring changes to our climate. The rainfall distribution will change and the frequency of severe weather events like typhoons will increase. Our weather patterns will undergo a profound change. It will also cause sea levels to rise and low-lying coastal areas to experience heavy floods. It is also predicted to affect the crops we grow and may even lead to decrease in crop production.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As someone who has experienced evacuating before during a typhoon in the Philippines, I can say that it can be a stressful and chaotic experience. When the authorities issue an evacuation order, it is important for people to take it seriously and follow the instructions provided. This might mean leaving your home and seeking shelter in a designated evacuation center, or it could mean going to the home of a friend or relative who lives in a safer area.</p><p></p><p>During the evacuation process, it is common for people to feel anxious and uncertain about what the future holds. This can lead some individuals to act irrationally or make poor decisions. For example, I have seen people try to bring unnecessary items with them, such as large furniture or appliances, which can slow down the evacuation process and make it more difficult for everyone involved.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, I have also seen people come together and exhibit acts of kindness and compassion during the evacuation process. For example, I have seen neighbors help each other carry heavy items and load them into vehicles, and I have seen people offer to share their resources, such as food and water, with those who have less.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the evacuation experience can be challenging, but it is important for people to remain calm and follow the instructions provided by the authorities. By working together and supporting one another, we can make the evacuation process as smooth and stress-free as possible.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:It was a rainy Saturday morning. Like any other ordinary weekend, my children and I watched cartoons early in the morning together in our house ar Riverside Village, Brgy. Sta. Lucia, Pasig City. At around 10AM, we started preparing our food for lunch. It surprised me when I went out of our house and saw flood starting to get high, which isn’t normal in our village. Some of our neighbors blamed the flood to the excavation of Manila Waters.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>When I was preparing at the kitchen, the rug I was stepping on was soaked I though it was just a leak from the sink. I tried to replace it, but after a couple of minutes, it was damp again, so I checked out all the corners of the house. Just then, the flood began to enter. We try to mop it out so that it will not enter my children’s room, but when I saw water coming out of the comfort room, I immediately called my brother-in-law so that he could come over to get my children and bring them to their house where it was safer.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>We put everything on our house’s high places. We thought that if flood will continue to fill our house, it would reach up to knee level. We left and had lunch at my in-law’s house. When we came back, the water had already reached our sofa, so we put everything on our bed but still the water got higher. My in-laws started to help us get necessary things such as my children’s milk and some clothes good for 2 days. Meanwhile, flood water continued to enter our house, so we put our refrigerator, washing machines, electric fan, and other appliances about a table high. In a minute, our refrigerator tilted and fell in water. The only thing we could do at that time was to get all the food we could get. I tried to get back to our room to get additional clothes, but my husband grabbed me out of the house because the flood was almost chest level. He told me to leave everything. In a matter of 2 hours the water immersed all the things that we had.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

What did the narrator learn from the devastation caused by the typhoon? -6 Why is it claimed that the school has a special role to play in the aftermath of a tragedy such as Typhoon Yolanda? -7 Explain Edward Said’s assertion on the role of teachers in society. ​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p></p>The article is entitled "Braving Storms" because it talks about the resilience and courage of the people affected by Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines who faced and endured the devastating storm.The article says that Typhoon Yolanda would go down in history as one of the strongest and deadliest typhoons that hit the Philippines. It caused massive destruction, loss of lives, and displacement of people. I agree with this observation as Typhoon Yolanda was indeed a tragic event that left a significant impact on the Philippines and its people.The narrator's attitude toward the victims of the typhoon is sympathetic and compassionate. The narrator acknowledges the sufferings and difficulties that the victims faced and highlights their strength and resilience in facing the disaster.The narrator saw the disaster in a positive light because it brought out the best in people, particularly in terms of their courage, determination, and willingness to help others in need. Although such disasters do not happen every day, the narrator points out that people's response to adversity can be inspiring and uplifting.From the devastation caused by the typhoon, the narrator learned the importance of resilience, courage, and hope in facing difficult situations. The narrator also learned the value of empathy and compassion in understanding the plight of others and helping them to recover from the disaster.The school has a special role to play in the aftermath of a tragedy such as Typhoon Yolanda because it can provide support, comfort, and assistance to students, families, and communities affected by the disaster. Schools can also help in the recovery process by providing education, counseling, and other resources to help people rebuild their lives.Edward Said asserts that teachers have a critical role to play in society as they are responsible for imparting knowledge, values, and critical thinking skills to students. He argues that teachers should not just transmit information but also help students to develop their own ideas, perspectives, and understanding of the world. Teachers can also act as agents of change by promoting social justice, diversity, and equality in their classrooms and communities.<br />
