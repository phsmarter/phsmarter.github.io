What effect does the repetition have on the description of the last stage of man?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The seven ages of man according to the poem are: infant, schoolboy, lover, soldier, justice, pantaloon, and second childishness/oblivion.</p><p>2. The school boy is depicted as being reluctant or unwilling to go to school, with a "shining morning face" and "creeping like snail."</p><p>3. In the first two lines, the world is compared to a stage and men and women are compared to players. 4. The two are related in that they both suggest the idea of life being a performance or an act.</p><p>5. In lines 13 and 14, a man's reputation is compared to a bubble, suggesting that it is fragile and fleeting.</p><p>6. Other comparisons in the poem include the infant being described as "mewling and puking," the lover sighing "like furnace," and the soldier being "bearded like the pard." The comparison of the infant to "mewling and puking" is an example of metaphor, while the comparisons of the lover sighing "like furnace" and the soldier being "bearded like the pard" are examples of simile.</p><p>7. As a man reaches the sixth and seventh ages, the speaker describes physical changes such as the man becoming "lean" and "slippered" and having "spectacles on nose and pouch on side," as well as mental changes such as his "big manly voice" turning "toward childish treble" and his mind becoming "second childishness, and mere oblivion."</p><p>8. This is a matter of personal opinion. Some people may agree with the speaker's description of old age as a time of physical decline and mental regression, while others may have different experiences or views of old age.</p><p>9. Other acceptable descriptions of old age might include a time of wisdom and experience, a time of reflection and contemplation, or a time of continued growth and learning.</p><p>10. The repetition of the word "sans" four times at the end of the poem serves to emphasize the complete lack or absence of various qualities in the final stage of man, such as teeth, eyes, taste, and everything else.</p><p>Other examples of repetition in the poem include the repetition of the phrase "the seven ages" and the repetition of the word "age" in the phrase "seven ages."</p><p>11. The repetition of the word "sans" serves to emphasize the complete lack or absence of various qualities in the final stage of man, which could suggest a sense of hopelessness or despair.</p><p></p><p>sana nakatulong! </p><p></p><br />
