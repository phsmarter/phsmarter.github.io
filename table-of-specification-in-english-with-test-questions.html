6. A recent encyclopedia entry about dogs cites multiple research papers done by scientists at veterinary schools. According to the article, Labrador retrievers come in two specific breeds: English and American. The English breed is described as stocky and heavy, while the American breed is described as tall and lanky. The article describes current scientific research as showing that males of both breeds usually weigh about 29-41 kg (65-90 lb), and females weigh 25-32 kg (55-70 lb). Coat colors for both breeds come in solid black, yellow, or chocolate. All labs have strong tails and webbed feet, which help them swim. Devon would like to use this information to determine if his new dog is an English or American Labrador retriever. 
Which best describes the reliability of the information?
A. It is not reliable because only scientists can use scientific information for reference.
B. It is not reliable because it doesn’t talk about how to test and only gives data about the breeds.
C. It is reliable because the article is based on multiple studies done by scientists at multiple veterinary schools.
D. It is reliable because it gives information about both types of Labradors in addition to information about other types of dogs.</p>

By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text? Why or why not?4. List or underline each hedging expression used in the text.</a>

B. It is not reliable because it doesn’t talk about how to test and only gives data about the breeds.
C. It is reliable because the article is based on multiple studies done by scientists at multiple veterinary schools.
D. It is reliable because it gives information about both types of Labradors in addition to information about other types of dogs.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>1. D. </strong>We are given a solution that is 2.50 L, and the conversion that 1 quart =0.943 liters. Now, to convert, we can just multiply 2.50 L x (1 quart / 0.943 L) = 2.65 quarts. Note how the "liters unit" is cancelled and we are left with quarts.</p><br /><p><strong>2. D. </strong> What is one advantage of using a computer over a graphing calculator?
</p><p>A. Computers are more useful for quick calculations.
</p><p>B. Computers are easier to transport to remote locations.
</p><p>C. Computers have lower power consumption.
</p><p>D. Computers hold larger amounts of data.</p><p>Options  A-C are actually advantages of a graphing calculator. Because it is more portable (B), it is easier to use for quick calculations (A). Since it's also smaller, it has a lower power consumption (C). Computers, however, because of their computing capacity can hold larger amounts of data.</p><br /><p><strong>3. C.</strong> Which of these steps would most likely be part of a lab procedure?
</p><p>A. Write a hypothesis to answer a question.
</p><p>B. Write a title at the top of a completed lab report.
</p><p>C. Record the time to complete a chemical reaction.
</p><p>D. Create a question on the cause of a chemical reaction.</p><p>Options A, B, and D are part of pre-lab and post-lab procedures. Only option C  actually needs to be done during the experiment. You'd need A and D (hypothesis and question) before lab, to know what to test. Option B would come after the lab experiment, because there is already a completed lab report.</p><br /><p><strong>4.C.</strong> A scientist collected the following data, which show how the pressure of water vapor changes with temperature.
</p><p>
What would a scientist do to best communicate these data to other scientists in a presentation?
</p><p>A. Replace the table with text highlighting pressures.
</p><p>B. Change the unit of pressure to atm.
</p><p>C. Make a graph for better visual representation.
</p><p>D. Display only rows 1, 3, and 6 of the data to simplify results.
</p><p>The data shows the relation of pressure and temperature, and the relationship between two quantities is best shown as a graph. Options A,B and D will still just give a lot of numbers which a layperson would probably have a difficult time understanding. Option D especially is a big NO, because you shouldn't just remove data like that. More than simplifying the results, it would change the results.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>5. A. </strong>A filmmaker wants to depict a realistic dramatization of a scientist making and communicating an important scientific discovery. Which plot description would best depict the methods of discovery and communication that a modern professional scientist uses?
</p><p>A. The scientist collaborates with others to plan and carry out an experiment and then writes a paper that has a clear conclusion. He submits it to a professional journal for peer review, after which the results are presented apublicly.
</p><p>B. The scientist works with a few other scientists in a secret lab that is sponsored by a large business corporation. When the scientists have results, they contact others in the scientific community to report their results.
</p><p>C. The scientist works alone in a lab until he makes a dramatic breakthrough and then immediately announces the results through a worldwide press conference.
</p><p>D. The scientist seeks input and data from a wide range of people of different scientific backgrounds and then publishes all the data and results on the Internet so that all the collaborators can apply it to their individual research.
</p><p>Option A is the answer because it is the only one that mentions peer reviews before releasing results. This is an important part of scientists discoveries since the discovery must be double-checked first before announced. It would just cause confusion if a scientist announces a wrong discovery.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>6. C. </strong>  
Which best describes the reliability of the information?
</p><p>A. It is not reliable because only scientists can use scientific information for reference.
</p><p>B. It is not reliable because it doesn’t talk about how to test and only gives data about the breeds.
</p><p>C. It is reliable because the article is based on multiple studies done by scientists at multiple veterinary schools.
</p><p>D. It is reliable because it gives information about both types of Labradors in addition to information about other types of dogs.
</p><p>Options B and D talk more about the completeness of the information rather than the reliability. Option A is not true, since scientific information can be used by anyone as reference. Option C is true since having multiple sources confirm the same thing makes it more reliable than just a single source. This is connected to the importance of peer reviews in number 5.</p><br /><p>Some additional sources:</p><p>Example on conversion: https://brainly.ph/question/86333</p><p>Data presentation: https://brainly.ph/question/1577588</p><p>Laboratory Equipment: https://brainly.ph/question/627413</p><p>Hope this helps!</p><br />

Need help pasagot po due today na kasi eh matinong sagot po sana nonsense reported, if di po alam wag nalang sumagot sayang po kasi yung points :&lt;DIRECTION: Read the text below and answer the questions that follow.SMART READINGStudents begin to read at an early age. By senior high school most students have, in fact, mastered the mechanics of reading. Specifically, students have learned to decode-or translate printed words into understandable sounds and language. It can be said that by college must students have progressed from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In the “reading to learn” phase, however, many students find themselves struggling to understand what they have read.Students find they can read words, but they do not always comprehend what they are reading. There are several reasons that contribute to this dilemma. First, 85-90 percent of what students learn in school comes from textbooks; most of the writing in textbooks is expository, or factual and informational. Research shows that expository writing is more difficult to comprehend than narrative writing, which generally tells astory. A second reason for the dilemma is that, as students’ progress from one grade to another, the complexity of reading comprehension becomes greater. Students with reading comprehension problems tend to fall farther behind each year.There is, however, help for struggling reader. There are “tools” or strategies that students can use to organize and manage their learning. Research shows that teaching students’ strategies to enable them to interact with what they are reading increase comprehension. In fact, the difference between successful and unsuccessful readers is actually reflected in their ability to effectively apply these strategies. Because of the correlation between the use of strategies and reading comprehension, it is extremely important that all teachers, not just English or reading teachers, structure their lessons to help students become purposeful readers. Having a purpose for reading makes students more focused, which, in turn, helps them understand and remember what they have read.Most teachers may not be trained to teach students to read (decode), but every teacher can teach reading strategies in their particular content. It has been said that good readers: are active readers; set goals for reading; including identifying the purpose for their reading; skim material before they read, noting things that are related to their goals; integrate their prior knowledge and make personal connections; develop questions that they hope to answer during the reading; make predictions about what is to come in the reading; monitor their understanding of the reading; try to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words or concepts; respond to text in a variety of ways; create visual representation to aid comprehension and recall; and determine important ideas.Teaching the strategies that will follow will enable students to develop all the traits of a good reader. The strategies include before reading are: SQ3R, Think-PairShare, KWL, and predicting.During reading strategies increase comprehension. These includes monitoring structure: finding the main idea/ details, sequencing/ordering, comparing/contrasting,and cause/effect, using context clues, determining fact from opinion, and inferring. Strategies to address special skills are interpreting photographs, political cartoons, graphs, charts, tables, maps are also included.After reading strategies help to assess comprehension and expand knowledge. It includes summarizing, paraphrasing, synthesizing, and testing.Questions:1. In this text, what is the main idea?2. Summarize the text in five sentences.3. Would this be considered academic text? Why or why not?4. List or underline each hedging expression used in the text.</h2><br />
