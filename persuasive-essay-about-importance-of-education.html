                                            Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Persuasive point 1: Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 2: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate; it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 3 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 4 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism, then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 5 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching Set A, Directions.

                        <p>Instead of forcing this idea of a degree as the only option, teachers and educators around the world should be encouraging open mindedness and choices. Over the years, being accepted and attending a college has become a rite of passage for high school graduates, however that was not always the case. The realization that needs to happen is that education is important; college is not (Hansen). There are so many other avenues that educators can promote that can equally lead to success just as much as obtaining a college degree can. Options exist such as going straight into the workforce, traveling, volunteering, learning a trade, joining the military, etc. (Hansen).</p><p></p><br />

                            13. Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Persuasive point 1: Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 2: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate; it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 3 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 4 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism, then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 5 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases).

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Education is something that holds utmost importance in one’s life. It is a tool that helps to acquire knowledge and attain light within the mind of an individual. Education makes you aware of everything happening around whether you are a child or an adult. Education is an ever-lasting process that ends with death. It helps in the overall development of an individual as we can acquire knowledge, skills, and many other things through education. A person’s attitude and personality highly depend on his education. It also plays a vital role in making a person successful in life.
</p><p>
</p><p>Employment is yet another benefit of acquiring education. People are more likely to get jobs when they are educated. It also improves the speech and communication way of people. Educated people can greatly influence society with their words and actions as they can express themselves more effectively.
</p><p>
</p><p>Educated people are more effective at using various technologies of the present era. Thus, education plays a great role in making us aware of numerous gadgets and technologies that can improve the quality of life. On the other hand, uneducated people find it quite difficult to withstand this modern era of technology.
</p><p>
</p><p>Education also makes a person mature and effective in his decisions. Educated people know the importance of discipline and time management and thus have greater opportunities to become successful people in life.
</p><p>
</p><p>Education is a fundamental right of every individual thus everyone must acquire education to understand every important aspect of life. Government is making many efforts to inculcate education in every class of people. Many government schools are established in different cities so that everyone can acquire knowledge and become successful in life. Education is the light of hope and a great thing to make one’s life full of content and happiness.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Education comes in many ways. When someone chooses to become educated, the highest possibility of learning, acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits is being processed. It includes educational methods like  teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Educating a person does not only happen through the guidance of educators, learners, willingly, can also educate themselves.</p><p>Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.</p><p>In our country, everyone has the right to education. Everyone should not be denied an education because of financial restrictions. There are actually zero tuition fees already to public schools making quality education more accessible. Parents' then are obliged to giving their children the proper education they deserve.</p><p>Education plays a vital role to a person's life because it gives the opportunity in taking control of his/her destinies. When we are educated, we are more likely to gain intelligence later in life. It also allows youth from staying away to illegal activities that may hinder their growth and in reaching their full potential. Thus, makes them better persons and better citizens with brighter future. Education is really of high importance because:</p>it creates more employment opportunities;secures a higher income;develops problem-solving skills;improves the economy;provides a prosperous and happy life;gives back to the community;creates modern society;bridges the borders;creates equal opportunities; andintroduces empowerment.<p></p><p>#brainlyfast</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Education is the line between dying of something easily curable or living. Education is the difference between being an informed, enlightened citizen, capable of participating in governance and holding that government accountable on one hand versus being a pawn incapable of discerning demagoguery or tyranny on the other. Education is the chance to pursue interests because they are intellectually stimulating rather than a life of merely surviving. Education is a clearer view to truth, leverage to exceed personal biases, the ability to reach beyond myths and embrace whatever is found. Education is the tool by which one may grow, express, pursue, enjoy and then share what is learned with others. To stand on the shoulders of those who came before and see farther than any before, to lift up those who follow that they may see farther still.
</p><p>
</p><p>Consider this: All the brain capital and all the materials for all the engineering to build all the things we so readily use today is built using stuff that was always available right here on Earth. The tools needed to solve problems that beset humanity for centuries became footnotes in history once formal education became more widely available.
</p><p>
</p><p>The millennia humanity spent toiling in the mud, dying young, fighting over land and resources while wasting what was already at hand, century upon century of the “haves” forcing to ground the “have nots” for shortsighted gain was never actually necessary. All the confident religions espousing assured truth, all the vanity of rulers enforcing selfish goals, all the wars fought by “us” against “them”, all of that waste might never have been had there been education available to more people.
</p><p>
</p><p>Slavery, universal suffrage, enforced genital mutilation, witch’s hangings, inquisition, excommunication, crusading, apartheid, castes, gerrymandering, capitalist excess, communist waste, pogroms, poverty - all of these things are defeated with education.
</p><p>
</p><p>And yet these problems continue to limit humanity. We have not yet seen what can be accomplished when every last one of us receives the chance to succeed as far as our ability may take us. If we are ever to reach our potential as a species, education is our path forward.
</p><p>
</p><p>A child is born as I write this. All the potential of that new life is as yet unknown. Every day that new person lives, their potential rises or falls by the weight of the society, culture, government and people where they live. Education is the most efficient tool ever devised by humanity to ensure that child’s potential rises. All the successes that child may know, and humanity benefit with them, depend on that child’s chance to use their abilities to best effect. Education is an exponential increase in those chances.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Since 1990s STEM is a term used to refer education policies to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. But is much more, because it has implications for workforce development, teaching frameworks, industries, no formal education, etc. Is a term which also involves the equity of a country and some challenges like the gender gap.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Art education is crucial for the children's development. Many school boards feel that art education is not a necessity and not very important in the lives of today's students. Art classes are constantly compared to the main core classes, such as math and English. Many people feel that core classes are much more valuable to a child's education, which is why art may be cut first from schools if there is low funding. Art classes offer children critical lessons about life that they are not exposed to in any of the other classes. Art teachers drive the creativity and the imagination of students, while allowing students to express themselves.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he or she cannot reason and consciously learn new things.</p><br />
