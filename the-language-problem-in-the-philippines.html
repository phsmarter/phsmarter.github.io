(An Excerpt)
Allan B.I. Bernardo
1.Did the article match what you expected, given whether English is important or not? 
2.Given the importance of English. Why do you think it is not the medium of instruction of other subjects in the curriculum? 
3.What is the difference between the importance of English and the importance of Filipino language to the Filipino nation?
4.Given that in the end, English will be a deciding factor on getting a job, do you think the DepEd's policy of multilingual education should still be implemented in the future? Explain. 
5.Do you think it is fair that one is more likely to get a job if one has an American accent? Why or why not? 
6.This was written in 2009. Now that the call center industry is firmly established in the Philippines, would you say that it helps boost our economy or otherwise? 
7.What are the ·advantages and disadvantages of relying on OFWs and call centers, as well as on the BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) industry in order to improve our economy? 
8.What do you think can help people be better in English?
9.Do you think watching American movies ·and TV shows can help improve one's English proficiency?
10.Why do some people discriminate against those who speak in English? Is this a healthy attitude? Why or why not?</a>

This case study made an in- depth inquiry of the communication skills of the Special Education (SPED) students in one of the community colleges in Quezon Province, Philippines. An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</a>

It doesn't only makes Filipinos effective in conversing in English but also creates opportunities to have work that uses English as main medium in terms of instruction. Moreover, being knowledgeable in English helps us land on a good paying job and understand how a system works. It only became a problem to those who are not able to attend school and have a  formal education. People perceived that you are one step ahead among others if your English speaking skills is better and can speak fluently with correct grammar, accent and pronunciation. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />

                            5. what is the problem with the use of english language writing philippine history if you use that pantayong pananaw perspective​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Filipino language has two forms for the English word “we/us”: “tayo” and “kami.” In Bahasa Indonesia, the same distinction holds for the pair “kita” and “kami” (Johns 1997). “Tayo,” which is described as the inclusive form of “we,” refers to a collectivity composed of both the speakers and the listeners in a communication context. “Kami,” which is described as the exclusive form of “we,” refers to a collectivity composed only of those who are speaking and does not include the receivers of the message. The word “Pantayo” was formed by the combination of the root word “tayo” and the prefix “pan-.” (Probably the first incidence of this term was as “pangtayo,” used as the translation of pronombre/pronoun in the grammar book Balarilang Tagalog, published in 1910). The whole word “pantayo” could roughly be interpreted to mean “from-us-for-us.” The conceptual contradictory of “pantayo” is the concept “pangkami,” which was formed from the root-word “kami” and the prefix “pang-”/“pam-.” “Pangkami” roughly means “from-us-for-you.” The other half of the phrase, “pananaw,” means “perspective.” So “pantayong pananaw” would be equivalent to the rather awkward “from-us-for-us perspective,” while “pangkaming pananaw” would mean the “from-us-for-you perspective.” “Pantayo” refers to a self-subsistent dialogical circle consisting of active (speaking) subjects, while “pangkami” denotes a situation in which the speakers present themselves as an “other-directed” collective object under the gaze (and therefore the spell) of an Other.
</p><p>
</p><p>The intellectual leader of the Pantayong Pananaw (PP) movement in the social sciences is Zeus A. Salazar. He was educated at the University of the Philippines (UP) and at the Sorbonne. His still unpublished doctoral thesis (Salazar 1968) already contained the basic ideas which would lead to his mature perspectives on cultural and historical methodology. He would continue to elaborate -these ideas in an increasingly systematic, intellectualized variant of the Filipino language throughout the 1970s and 1980s. After being deeply involved during Martial Law in the massive historical and ideological project initiated by the Marcos dictatorship called Tadhana (Marcos, 1976), several tentative and scattered articulations of the basic approach and philosophy of PP would appear in various magazines and short book introductions until the definitive systematic exposition of PP was published in 1991 as the essay “Ang Pantayong Pananaw Bilang Diskursong Pangkabihasnan” (Pantayong Pananaw as a civilizational discourse) (Salazar 1974; 1996; 1997). The implementation of the research agenda put forward in the basic programmatic statements of PP would be further actualized in a series of monographs published in the journal Bagong Kasaysayan (New History). While his intellectual leadership and remarkable originality have been vital, it should be clarified that Zeus A. Salazar is not Pantayong Pananaw. His influence as the moving force of PP extends from his contemporaries and colleagues in the field of history and various other disciplines to several generations of former students at the University of the Philippines. Among the scholars who have produced significant publications and theses/dissertations under the auspices of PP are Jaime Veneracion, Nilo Ocampo, Ferdinand Llanes, Portia Reyes, Efren B. Isorena, Vicente C. Villan, Mary Jane Rodriguez-Tatel, Jose Rhommel B. Hernandez, O.P., Myfel Joseph Paluga, Nancy Kimmuel-Gabriel, and Atoy M. Navarro. Meanwhile, the term “Pantayong Pananaw” has acquired several usages in the texts of Salazar and other scholars working within its parameters.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>maybe the problem is the difficulty of this language for the Flipinos to speak and make a sentence</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. There are other languages mainly used in the common household aside from English.</p><p>2. It is not the main spoken language of the Filipinos, even though it is characterized as a major language.</p><p>3. It also depends on the way it is taught.</p><p>4. There isn't a strict way of it being implemented.</p><p>5. There is no reason to for some Filipinos.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Most households speak Tagalog, Bisaya, Cebuano, and more rather than English. Probably in richer households, English may be a spoken language, but for the common households, it is not a requirement for them to understand each other.</p><p>2. Most Filipinos again would want to speak their own language when speaking to fellow Filipinos. Only if they were to speak to people of other countries, they will use English.</p><p>3. Sometimes, teachers teaching English may have errors that students may have absorbed, thus they may fail to speak the language correctly.</p><p>4. Since Filipino is the main language (along with a lot of languages and dialects that the Philippines is famous for), there would be trouble implementing English in Philippine schools. Rules like "English-speaking only" would not be able to teach Filipinos to speak the language correctly because they can just stay silent.</p><p>5. English is majorly used for speaking with other people of foreign origin, so why would Filipinos speak English when they can speak their own language?</p><br />

                            23. Communication Skills of Deaf Students in the Undergraduate Program in Quezon, Philippines. Mary Rose Q Cabreros Online Submission 1 (1), 20-42, 2020Language acquisition may come naturally for people without sensorial disabilities. But for deaf children, language acquisition happens differently and comparably delayed than hearing children. This case study made an in- depth inquiry of the communication skills of the Special Education (SPED) students in one of the community colleges in Quezon Province, Philippines. An English Proficiency Test in the areas of Vocabulary, Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Analysis (Cause and Effect; Making Inferences) and Following Directions was given to the students. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was also conducted to gather data regarding problems encountered in their English classes. The gathered data were tabulated using frequency and percentage for the English Proficiency Test, while Conversation Analysis for FGD. The English Proficiency results revealed that Vocabulary, Reading Comprehension and Making Inferences were the three key areas where the respondents exhibit the lowest skills.please give me a reflection to this article ​</h2><br />
                        ANSWER:This article highlights the challenges faced by deaf students in acquiring language, specifically in the context of English language learning in the Philippines. The study conducted in one community college in Quezon Province reveals that deaf students struggle with vocabulary, reading comprehension, and making inferences. The results of the study emphasize the importance of addressing the specific needs of deaf students in language learning and the need for additional support and resources to help them succeed.It is inspiring to see that there are efforts being made to better understand the challenges faced by deaf students and to find ways to support their language acquisition. However, it is concerning to see that there are still significant barriers that need to be overcome. This study serves as a reminder of the importance of inclusiveness in education and the need to ensure that all students, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, have equal access to quality education and resources.In conclusion, this article highlights the need for continued research and efforts to support the communication skills of deaf students in the Philippines and beyond. It is important for educators and policymakers to recognize the unique needs of deaf students and to take action to ensure their success in language learning and beyond.<p></p><br />
