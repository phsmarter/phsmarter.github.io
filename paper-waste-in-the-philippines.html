                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Electronic materials are materials that have been investigated and used primarily for their electrical capabilities, as opposed to other features. It is the dynamics of electrons and their interactions with atoms and molecules that are responsible for the majority of the electric response of materials.</strong></p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Recycling outdated electronic gadgets helps to conserve energy. The reduction in the requirement to extract raw materials from nature to manufacture new technologies is also a benefit. Reusing obsolete equipment helps to reduce e-waste by preventing it from ending up in landfills. Finally, recycling conserves raw resources that can be utilized in the manufacture of new products.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>The act of discarding obsolete gadgets is not only harmful to the environment, but it is also against the law. Electronically generated waste, commonly known as e-waste, is completely recyclable. There's a good chance you have certain electronics in your possession that you should never throw out in the garbage.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>_</strong><strong>_</strong><strong>-</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>In 1991, the Philippines passed a law requiring business to take back and recycle all forms of packaging. A large group of business formed a company to collect and recycle these packages. Its cost are 45 centavos per kilo for glass 9.5 centavos per kilo for paper and 74 centavo per kilo for plastic and the average recycling cost of about P100 per ton for glass and P200 per ton for plastic and the average recycling cost P500 per ton. A developing country has offered to create a giant landfill and accept the Philippines waste at a cost of P400 per ton, which includes P50 per ton sorting and transport cost and a P350 per ton fee to be paid to the developing country.</strong></p><p><strong>Questions:</strong></p><strong>Should the Philippines accept this proposal?</strong><strong>Will the proposal benefit the developing country?</strong><strong>What alternative or modification to the proposal might you suggest?</strong><p>In my opinion, I think the Philippines should accept this proposal because this is an opportunity for the Philippines to let go <strong>unsustainable packaging.</strong> In the second question, in the financial sense, the developing country might benefit from the proposal because of two things. First, they will have additional income. Second, if the developing country is able to recycle the materials that they have collected, it can become another form of resource and may be able to establish homegrown <strong>sustainable packaging companies.</strong> For the last question, I suggest that the contract remain intact in order to finally stop the<strong> worst packaging for the environment.</strong></p><br /><br /><br />
