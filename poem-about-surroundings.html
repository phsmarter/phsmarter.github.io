                                            B. Read and analyze the poem below and answer the guide questions below. In Community Poem by Sailing to windward In community lies strength of numbers, to support the sick and the weak. In community somebody hears me, with louder voices to speak In community lies public purpose, to shield from the harshness of life. To offer and receive common friendship, to protect from the gun and the knife In community we teach each other about science and art and sport. From this we gain our vitality, and through this our sickness is fought. In community others surround us. Their dreams, their love and their faces, encourage our hearts to prosper; our minds to accept other places. In community disaster may come But, grief shared and faith in our all, makes death's pall linger less strongly, our tears with others can fall. In community lies man's ambition. Without, makes larger our fears. Together we make sense of being and bring joy and length to our years. Source: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/in-community/ Guide Questions: 1.

                            28. B. Read and analyze the poem below and answer the guide questions below. In Community Poem by Sailing to windward In community lies strength of numbers, to support the sick and the weak. In community somebody hears me, with louder voices to speak In community lies public purpose, to shield from the harshness of life. To offer and receive common friendship, to protect from the gun and the knife In community we teach each other about science and art and sport. From this we gain our vitality, and through this our sickness is fought. In community others surround us. Their dreams, their love and their faces, encourage our hearts to prosper; our minds to accept other places. In community disaster may come But, grief shared and faith in our all, makes death's pall linger less strongly, our tears with others can fall. In community lies man's ambition. Without, makes larger our fears. Together we make sense of being and bring joy and length to our years. Source: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/in-community/ Guide Questions: 1.
