                            30. 1. Researchers looking for fossils of the earliest life forms face many hurdles. For example, few sedimentary rocks date back more than 3 billion years. Recall what you learned about plate tectonics. Explain why so few remaining samples of these early rocks remain.</h2><br />
                        ANSWER:<p></p><p>- There are four types of boundaries between tectonic plates that are defined by the movement of the plates: <strong>divergent</strong> and <strong>convergent</strong> <strong>boundaries,</strong> <strong>transform</strong> <strong>fault</strong> boundaries, and plate boundary zones.</p><p></p><strong>Where are the tectonic plates?</strong><p></p><p>- The lithosphere, which is the rigid outermost shell of a planet (the crust and upper mantle), is broken into <strong>tectonic</strong> <strong>plates.</strong> The Earth's lithosphere is composed of seven or eight major <strong>plates</strong> (depending on how they are defined) and many minor <strong>plates.</strong></p><p></p>What are the 7 tectonic plates?<p></p><p>- There are major, minor and micro tectonic plates. There are seven major plates: African, Antarctic, <strong>Eurasian, Indo-Australian, North American, Pacific</strong> and South American. The Hawaiian Islands were created by the <strong>Pacific Plate,</strong> which is the world's largest plate at 39,768,522 square miles.</p><p></p>What are the 3 causes of plate movement?<p></p><p>- In this lesson, we explore the <strong>causes of plate movement,</strong> including thermal convection, ridge push and slab pull.</p><p></p><p><strong>#CARRYONLEARNINGS</strong></p><br />
