                                            36. “Maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday’s me is still me. I am who I am today, with all my faults. Tomorrow I might be a tiny bit wiser, and that’s me, too. These faults and mistakes are what I am, making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life. I have come to love myself for who I was, who I am, and who I hope to become.” - RM *a. The statement uses faulty logic because it doesn’t have any sound judgment. It talks about mistakes then suddenly talks about constellations.b. The statement uses unsupported facts because it doesn’t provide enough evidence and definition as to what type of mistake is being talked about.c. The statement uses emotional appeal because it makes us accept the mistakes that we did and how they are part of who we are.d. The statement doesn’t use any of the persuasion techniques.​</a>

                                            1 INTRODUCTORY CONCEPT: How persuasive are you in doing what you want? In this time of pandemic, almost everyone encountered difficulty in handling their "new normal" lifestyle. Please read the story of a persuasive athlete and how he handled his problem. Jack loved swimming and he was good at it. So good, in fact, that he hoped to swim on the U.S. Olympic team. While training for the Olympics, however, he hurt his leg. Jack was not allowed to swim for at least one month. He spent the first few weeks moping and sitting around all day. The doctor told Jack that special exercises would help the leg heal more quickly. At first, Jack was so unhappy that he didn't do the exercises. One day his coach came to visit. Jack never told anyone what his coach told him, but it must have impressed him. From that day on, he did the exercises. Let's Talk About These: 1. What was the setting of the story? 2. Who were the characters? 3. What was the conflict of the story? 4. How did the story end? 5. What was the author's purpose for telling the story?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I hope this helps</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Love is a beautiful thing. It makes people happy. It can change a person, and show someone things that they never knew about themselves. It lifts one up, knowing there is always someone who will stand by their side through anything. It brings people together, and makes the world a better place. Some people may disagree; they might think love is just a fantasy. Either way, it is a fantasy that everyone deserves to dream of and experience in all its glory, whether straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. However, not all people are so accepting of love when it is not in the form that they are familiar with, or is not demonstrated in ways that they think are proper. This can be easily seen in society’s treatment of non-heterosexuals,…show more content…</p><p>Yes, the legal definition of marriage includes that it is between one man and one woman. This definition is not fair. Marriage should be about powerful love and support, despite the genders of the two recipients.</p><p></p><br />

A version of hell or heaven. Love is the one thing that is shown off as amazing or something that everyone will find.

Love is something that will end up hurting you. ‘’It is discomfort — it is not what the films say. Only songs, get it  right’’.  </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

Jack loved swimming and he was good at it. So good, in fact, that he hoped to swim on the U.S. Olympic team. While training for the Olympics, however, he hurt his leg. Jack was not allowed to swim for at least one month. He spent the first few weeks moping and sitting around all day. The doctor told Jack that special exercises would help the leg heal more quickly. At first, Jack was so unhappy that he didn't do the exercises. One day his coach came to visit. Jack never told anyone what his coach told him, but it must have impressed him. From that day on, he did the exercises. Let's Talk About These: 1. What was the setting of the story? 2. Who were the characters? 3. What was the conflict of the story? 4. How did the story end? 5. What was the author's purpose for telling the story?​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Self-love is that beautiful courage noticed by others as a form of inspiration. It’s that endless laughter at every silly and awkward thing. It is that utter thankfulness and bountiful gratitude to everything. It’s the positive outlook in every downfall; and the ray of hope in a once lonely path.</p><p></p><p>Self-love is not selfish; in fact it is enriched with uptight caring for others. It is a unique way of saying “hey, I would like to love myself first, so I can love you more.” It’s that sweet reminder that loving is not limited to partners, and that loving is the fruit of respecting oneself.</p><p></p><p>Love should be shared, yes, but nobody ever forbid love to be supplemented within oneself, in order for it to grow, and in order for it to be beautiful and nourishing — that it may not destroy anybody.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>God created the world with love and devotion. As stated in John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting eternal life.” God love is so strong for his saints that he made sacrifices for us be a part of this world that he created. Christians should love the environment and its preservation and anyone who doesn’t the love of the father is not in him. As God created plants, and animals he also created humans to take care of the environment that he love so dearly. The action that God want Christians to express is love, compassion, and kindness regarding the environment and its preservation. Throughout this essay I will provide adequate quotes from the Bible and research to convince Christians of the appropriate actions that should be taken regarding the environment and its preservation. God announces his love for the environment several times in the Old Testament. As stated in Deuteronomy 7:13-14 “and he will love and bless you and multiply you he will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land the …show more content…</p><p>In Isaiah 5:8-10 the Lord judges those who misused the land. Tress may be cut down to build houses or to make a fire for heat. Everything that God created is resourceful and it’s for a purpose however, we should limit ourselves to what God provided in order to protect the environment. Most worldviews and religions have made the environment not a big enough issue and do not get involved. Not taking over the environment is a way of letting the enemy win and get what he came to destroy</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>kau na bahala magpili kung hanngang saan yung kaya nyong sagutan</p><br />
