This is extremely harmful to the earth as well as humans. It is quite challenging to control global warming; however, it is not unmanageable. The first step in solving any problem is identifying the cause of the problem. Therefore, we need to first understand the causes of global warming that will help us proceed further in solving it.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Climate change and global warming are two interrelated phenomena that are posing a serious threat to our planet. The impact of these two problems is so significant that they are gradually reducing the average life expectancy of individuals. While the root causes of these problems may be complex and multifaceted, some significant factors include industrialization, deforestation, and overpopulation. In this essay, we will discuss the causes of climate change and global warming, as well as the measures that governments and healthcare sectors can take to solve this problem.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>One of the primary causes of climate change and global warming is the increasing level of industrialization across the globe. The more factories and production facilities are established, the more fossil fuels are burnt, and consequently, the more greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere. This, in turn, leads to the greenhouse effect, causing a rise in global temperatures. Another significant factor is deforestation, as trees play a crucial role in regulating the climate. When forests are cleared to make room for human activities such as agriculture and urbanization, the carbon-absorbing trees are destroyed, contributing to global warming. Finally, overpopulation is another significant cause of climate change and global warming, as the rising number of people on the planet leads to increased demand for resources and energy, which often results in environmental degradation.</p><p>To solve the problem of climate change and global warming, governments and healthcare sectors can take several measures. First, governments can implement regulations and policies that aim to reduce carbon emissions and promote cleaner energy sources, such as wind and solar power. Second, healthcare sectors can develop and implement programs to educate individuals about the importance of reducing their carbon footprint and taking small steps towards environmental conservation. Finally, governments and healthcare sectors can work together to promote sustainable development and environmental conservation, which can help to curb the negative impact of climate change.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, climate change and global warming are serious threats that the world is facing, and they are reducing the average life expectancy of individuals. Industrialization, deforestation, and overpopulation are some of the primary causes of these problems. However, by implementing regulations and policies that aim to reduce carbon emissions, promoting sustainable development, and educating individuals about the importance of environmental conservation, governments and healthcare sectors can play a crucial role in solving this problem</p><br />
