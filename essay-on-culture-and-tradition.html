                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Culture can be defined as “the arts and other manifestations of human intellectual achievement regarded collectively.” It can also be understood as the ideas, customs, and social behavior of a particular people or society. Therefore, it’s the shared patterns of our behavior and interaction which are learned through socialization. People of the same culture share a group identity that is fostered by social patterns unique to the group. Culture encompasses for example values, beliefs, symbols, norms, and patterns of behavior. It has a far-reaching impact on our everyday actions, on how we talk and think, what we wear, what we believe, how we sit at the table, and how we behave among other people. But what is the importance of culture in our society? And which components constitute our conception of culture?<p></p>Components of culture<p></p>ValuesBeliefsSymbolsNormsPatterns of behavior<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The culture and traditions of the Filipino people are deeply rooted in their history and shaped by their interactions with various foreign influences. The Philippines is a country with a rich cultural heritage, and the values that underpin Filipino culture reflect the resilience and adaptability of the Filipino people.</p><p></p><p>One of the defining characteristics of Filipino culture is the emphasis on family and community. The Filipino people place great importance on the bond between family members and the sense of belonging that comes from being part of a tight-knit community. This value is reflected in the traditional concept of “bayanihan,” which emphasizes the importance of working together for the greater good of the community.</p><p></p><p>Filipinos are also known for their strong sense of hospitality and warmth towards guests. This value is reflected in the traditional practice of “pakikipagkapwa,” which means treating others with kindness and respect. Filipinos are known to go out of their way to make visitors feel welcome in their homes and communities, and this trait is a key part of their culture.</p><p></p><p>Respect for elders and the elderly is another important value in Filipino culture. The elderly are often considered the repository of wisdom and knowledge, and are accorded high regard in Filipino society. This is reflected in the traditional practice of “pagpapakonsiderado” which means to consider the feelings and needs of others.</p><p></p><p>Religion also plays a significant role in Filipino culture. Roman Catholic Christianity is the dominant religion in the Philippines, but many indigenous communities have retained their traditional spiritual practices. The values of respect and devotion to God, family and country are imbued in the Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these values, Filipino culture is also known for its rich artistic traditions. The Philippines has a long history of folk music, dance and visual arts. These traditions are often deeply connected to the natural environment and reflect the spiritual beliefs of the Filipino people.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the culture and traditions of the Filipino people are shaped by their history and interactions with various foreign influences. The values that underpin Filipino culture reflect the resilience and adaptability of the Filipino people, and are deeply ingrained in their daily lives. These values, traditions and culture make the Filipino people who they are today, and will continue to shape their future.</p><br />

                        <strong>ESSAY</strong><p></p><p>The Philippines is a country with a rich and diverse culture, shaped by a history of colonial and foreign influence. Many of the traditions and customs of the Philippines are influenced by the indigenous cultures of the Austronesian people, as well as by the Spanish, American, and Chinese cultures that have left their mark on the country.</p><p></p><p>One of the most distinctive traditions of the Philippines is the celebration of fiestas, or festivals. Fiestas are held to honor a patron saint or to mark an important event in the community. They typically involve religious ceremonies, parades, and cultural events such as dance performances and music.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of Philippine culture is the role of family and community. Filipinos place a strong emphasis on close relationships with family and friends, and it is common for extended families to live together or to be closely connected. Community involvement is also highly valued, and it is not uncommon for people to participate in neighborhood organizations or volunteer their time to help others.</p><p></p><p>Filipino cuisine is another aspect of the country's culture that is deeply ingrained in daily life. The Philippines has a wide variety of dishes that are influenced by both indigenous and foreign culinary traditions. Some popular dishes include adobo, a marinated meat dish; sinigang, a sour soup; and lechon, a roasted pig.</p><p></p><p>The Philippines is also home to a number of traditional crafts and art forms. These include basket weaving, wood carving, and the creation of intricate beadwork and jewelry.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The culture of the Philippines comprises a blend of traditional Filipino and Spanish Catholic traditions, with influences from America and other parts of Asia. The Filipinos are family oriented and often religious with an appreciation for art, fashion, music and food.</p><p></p><p>Filipinos are also hospitable people who love to have a good time. This often includes getting together to sing, dance, and eat. The annual calendar is packed with festivals, many of which combine costumes and rituals from the nation’s pre-Christian past with the Catholic beliefs and ideology of present day.</p><p></p><p>Filipino people are known as settlers in many parts of the world. They are like the chameleon who easily adapts to different environments. They thrive to survive. Survival of the fittest is their banner.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Philippines is a country that has varied cultural influences. Most of these influences are results of previous colonization, deriving mainly from the culture of Spain and the United States. Despite all of these influences, the old Asian culture of Filipinos has been retained and are clearly seen in their way of life, beliefs and customs. Wherever you go, Filipino culture is very evident and has largely been appreciated and even applauded in many parts of the world.</p><p></p><p>Music, Arts and Literature</p><p>Filipinos are very fond of music. They use various materials to create sound. They love performing dances (Tiniking and Carinosa) and group singing during festive celebrations. Settlers from Spain introduced to them a variety of musical instruments like the ukulele, trumpet, drums and violin. Most of their music is contemporary and they have also learned to write their own songs based on real life events. People are also fond of folklore, which was influenced by the early church and Spanish literature.  Jose Rizal, the country’s national hero, is famous for his literature and novels inspired from the independence story of the country.</p><br />

                            14. Write a Reflective Essay about Filipino Values, Culture and Tradition that affects modern influence of today as a Filipino Citizen.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>As a Filipino citizen, I have been exposed to various values, culture, and traditions that are deeply ingrained in our society. These aspects of our identity have shaped the way we live our lives and interact with others. Our values, culture, and traditions have been passed down from generation to generation, and they continue to have a significant impact on our daily lives.</strong></p><p></p><p>One of the most prominent Filipino values that I have observed is the value of close family ties. In our culture, family always comes first. We are taught to respect and care for our elders, and we are expected to help out our family members in times of need. This value is evident in the way we celebrate important occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and other significant milestones. It is common for families to come together and celebrate these events with great enthusiasm, showcasing the unity and love that exists within our families.</p><p></p><p>Another significant aspect of Filipino culture is our deep religious faith. Religion plays a significant role in our lives, and it is reflected in our daily practices and beliefs. Our religious values have instilled in us the importance of respect, humility, and compassion towards others. We believe that by being good and living a life according to our faith, we can make the world a better place.</p><p></p><p>Filipino traditions and customs also play a vital role in shaping our identity. For instance, the practice of “bayanihan,” which is a spirit of communal unity and cooperation, is still evident in many rural areas. The concept of “utang na loob,” or a sense of indebtedness to someone who has done you a favor, is another example of how Filipino customs and traditions have shaped our character.</p><p></p><p>However, as a modern Filipino citizen, I also recognize that some aspects of our culture may not be applicable or appropriate in the modern world. For example, some traditional gender roles may not be suitable in today's society, and there is a need to promote gender equality and respect for diversity.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, Filipino values, culture, and traditions have had a significant influence on who we are as a people. As a Filipino citizen, I am proud of our rich culture and traditions, but I also recognize the need to adapt and adjust to the changing times. We need to embrace the positive aspects of our culture and traditions while also being open to change and progress. By doing so, we can continue to uphold our identity as a people and make a positive contribution to the world.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Eyo</strong></p><p>Although the basic purposes of Kabuki are to entertain and to allow the actors to demonstrate their skills, there is a didactic element, an ideal represented by the notion of kanzen-chōaku (“reward the virtuous and punish the wicked”).</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Kabuki is a traditional Japanese theatrical art form that has been performed for over 400 years. Its origins can be traced back to the Edo period of Japan, during which it became popular among the common people. Kabuki has played a significant role in the life, culture, and traditions of Japan, and its importance extends far beyond the realm of entertainment.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, Kabuki has been a source of entertainment for the Japanese people for centuries. Its unique blend of music, dance, and drama has captivated audiences for generations, and its popularity has endured to this day. Kabuki performances often feature extravagant costumes and makeup, as well as elaborate set designs, which make the experience even more visually stunning. It has become a significant aspect of Japanese culture, and many people continue to enjoy Kabuki performances as a way to connect with their country's history and traditions.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Kabuki has played an important role in preserving and promoting Japanese cultural heritage. Through its performances, Kabuki has helped to preserve the traditional stories, legends, and myths of Japan, which might otherwise have been lost to history. Many of the plays performed in Kabuki are based on classic works of Japanese literature, such as The Tale of Genji and The Pillow Book, and they help to keep these important cultural artifacts alive for future generations. In addition, Kabuki has helped to spread Japanese culture to other parts of the world, as performances are often staged outside of Japan, introducing international audiences to this unique art form.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Kabuki has also played an important role in shaping Japanese identity and national consciousness. Kabuki has been performed during many important events and celebrations throughout Japan's history, including festivals, political events, and national holidays. These performances have often been used as a way to promote national unity and pride, and to reinforce the values and traditions that are important to Japanese society. Through its emphasis on Japanese history, culture, and traditions, Kabuki has helped to shape the collective consciousness of the Japanese people and has contributed to the country's sense of national identity.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Kabuki is a highly significant art form that has played an important role in the life, culture, and traditions of Japan. It has provided entertainment to the Japanese people for centuries and has helped to preserve and promote Japan's cultural heritage. Kabuki has also played a role in shaping Japanese identity and national consciousness, and its importance extends far beyond the realm of theater. As such, Kabuki remains an important part of Japan's cultural identity and continues to be celebrated and enjoyed by people all over the world.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Folk performing arts range from vocal and instrumental music, dance and drama. It is one of the important genres of folklore. They include numerous cultural expressions that reflect human creativity and that are also found in many other intangible cultural heritage domains. It involves one’s ability to stand back from where he or she is to become more aware of cultural values, beliefs, and perceptions. Preserving these values, beliefs, and traditions can pose a great challenge especially today when culture has become vulnerable because of globalization.Philippine culture is exceptional and unique in nature. It was also discussed that culture separates its distinction from the rest of the world since the country showcased colorful and lively culture that makes distinctly Filipino. This includes traditions, language, arts, music, literature, etc. which are found in museums, churches, and galleries within the heart of the key cities. Also, provinces have their own identifying folk dances showcasing the elegance and beauty of the way people do things, dress, and illustrate different paintings as they have been influenced by events that happened in history.The preservation of the cultural heritage of one country is as important as the understanding of the historic wealth where the culture comes from. This signifies the essence of culture in one country down to the people living within. Culture individually affects people on the different questioning of how and where such a thing came from.

They used these mediums to create beautiful and intricate works of art that celebrated the gods and goddesses of their religion, as well as the pharaohs and other important figures.</p><p></p><p>Egyptian traditions and customs are also an important part of the culture. One of the most well-known Egyptian traditions is the celebration of Ramadan.

                            30. Write a Reflective Essay about Filipino Values, Culture and Tradition that affects modern influence of today as a Filipino Citizen.​</h2><br />
                        <p> As a Filipino citizen, I have been exposed to the values, culture and traditions of my country since I was a child. Growing up in the Philippines has shaped me into the person I am today and has had a profound influence on my life. </p><p></p><p>The Filipino culture is one that is deeply rooted in respect for elders, family values and strong religious beliefs. Respect for elders is an important part of our culture; it is expected that children will show respect to their parents and other adults in their lives. This value has been instilled in me from an early age, teaching me to be respectful of those around me regardless of age or status. </p><p></p><p>Family values are also highly valued within Filipino culture; family members are expected to look out for each other’s well-being and support one another through difficult times. This value has taught me the importance of being there for my loved ones when they need it most, as well as how to be supportive even when things get tough. </p><p></p><p>Religion plays an important role in Filipino culture; many Filipinos practice Catholicism or some form of Christianity which influences our daily lives greatly. This value has taught me about faithfulness and humility, as well as how to live according to God’s will rather than my own desires or ambitions. It also serves as a reminder that no matter what happens in life, God will always be there with us if we turn towards Him with faith and trust Him with our lives. </p><p></p><p>These traditional values have had a great impact on modern society here in the Philippines; they serve as reminders that we should always strive towards being better people by respecting others regardless of age or status, looking out for our loved ones during difficult times and living according to God’s will rather than our own desires or ambitions. These values have helped shape who I am today by teaching me valuable lessons about life which I carry with me wherever I go – something which makes me proud to call myself a Filipino citizen!</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong, pa brainliest nmn</p>Here, take a look at the pictures above. hope it helps ^-^]✓<p></p><br />
