He also wrote x + y &gt; 24 as an example of linear inequality in two variables. Is he correct? Why or why not? A. Yes, because x + y = 24 is written in Ax+ By C which use equal sign. Moreover, x+y&gt; 24 is written in Ax+By &gt; C and uses one of inequality symbol. B. Yes, because Jose gave example a linear inequality and equation but did not use two variables. C. No, because Jose did not change the variable, he only changes equal sign into greater than symbol. D. No, because it does not show any relationship of variables.​</a>
