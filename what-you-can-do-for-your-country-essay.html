                                            Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                                            Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

                                            Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he orshe cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 4 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses.

                                            ASSESS Directions: Identify if the following articles is an Informative essay or not. Write check (/) If It is an informative essay and cross (X) if not. 1. What can we do to have a healthy circulatory system? Don't smoke!...Take vitamin E to keep the arteries supple. Eat those fresh vegetables and fruit that supply you with antioxidants- very good for your heart. Eat fish instead of red meat - much better for your heart. 2. First identified in the 1950s, dengue is spread by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito; the first documented cases were in the Philippines and Thailand. The disease has since struck worldwide, with over 100 countries at risk and 390 million infections yearly. It takes 4-10 days to become obvious, with a high fever and flu-like symptoms. It does not have a cure. The only thing to be done is to maintain the patient's bodily fluids until the disease runs its course. It is crucial that dengue be detected early, as the proper medical attention can lower mortality from 20 percent to just under 1 percent. Left unchecked or identified, dengue kills. 3. Arroyo, who was recently re-elected to a third term as Pampanga representative, received her release papers from the Sandiganbayan after the high tribunal's ruling was released earlier in the day saying the antigraft court erred in its findings that the former President personally benefited from intelligence funds of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO). 4. True! -nervous-very, very dreadfully nervous i had been and am! but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses-not destroyed-not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily-how calmly I can tell you the whole story. 5. How to keep your hair healthy? Wash your hair two to three times a week. Avoid hot showers. Shampoo your scalp, not your roots. Towel-dry your hair before applying conditioner. Brush your hair twice a day, from the bottom up. Use a low-heat setting for hair-drying and point the nozzle down, not side-on. Try castor oil, hair oil and dry shampoo.nonsense=report or bannedright answer=brainlest and follow​</a>

He was a member of the Philippine Assembly in 1907 to 1909, resident commissioner to the US Congress in 1909-1916, and president of the Philippine Senate in 1916-1935. He was elected president on September 17, 1935. As president of the land, Quezon worked hard for the independence of our country, the development of the people and for a national language. National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave, industrious, self- reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbued with sound patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from trials and bitter strife of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind. The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights. The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among men. It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly they should be: morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited. I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength. We are Orientals. Orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. In the world of humanity, we look upon a quiet lake from which adventures and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow Filipinos to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self-discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace. 1.

How Our Cultural, Socio-Economic and Religious Background Have an Impact in Resolving the Covid 19 Pandemic in our Country?
by: Maricel Guevarra Veniegas
 The end is still not insight! Perhaps most of you will agree that the end of this pandemic which we have been battling off with nearly two years was still uncertain. There are many lives lost and victims who are fighting for their lives. Schools were still closed, our economy continued to slow down, and our movements were restricted. For Juan dela Cruz but not with Uncle Sam and other neighboring countries who seem to live back to normal. But why? What are the contributing factors why we can’t go back to our normal lives well in fact other countries can?
Cultural background. As for the latest statistics it was found out that rising cases of Covid 19 is the spread among families. Reported news showed that the virus spread fastly among households and family members. Filipinos are known to have a culture of close family ties. Many extended families whereas parents, married children and sometimes even grandparents are living under one roof. In addition, Filipinos have a culture of having too many celebrations and karaoke will never be absent. With this kind of belief, the spread of viruses is being hastened up. 
Socio-economic background. When strict implementation of quarantine was made many Filipinos resisted clamoring that they will not die with the virus but with famine since their daily needs depend on their livelihood. The Philippines is a developing country almost 75 – 80 percent of its citizens are on the poverty line hence these quarantines will even push them into poverty line. So, by no choice, they continue to earn a living despite the threat of being contaminated with the virus to feed their hungry mouth. Hence, cutting down the number of cases in the country is challenging on the government’s part since Filipinos need to continue earning.
Religious background. Among all the contributing factors presented this might be the least. Though Filipinos were said to be religious, the government successfully implemented minimum health protocols in religious gathering and even halted mass gathering that has something to do with religious tradition like fiesta, baptismal and the like.
To sum it up, the cultural and socio-economic background of the Filipinos have an impact in slowing down the mitigation of the pandemic. The pandemic did not change how we Filipinos live by culture and by our economic status. We continue to live together with our family and earn our living even if it will mean risking and losing our lives against the Covid virus.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is a simple thing. To have a better environment for the country, we need to ask ourselves what we can do for our country. The country itself won't work for us but rather, we work for it and we strive to make it a better place for us to live in. For example, as students, we study to learn to be able to get a job and getting a job means benifitting not only us or our family but also our country.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I know my answer is not an essay but it might give you a glimpse of an idea to work or write on. </p><p></p><p>P.S.

                        <p>During his inaugural speech on Jan. 20, 1961, U.S. President John F. Kennedy uttered the challenge, “And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.” Its simple meaning was to challenge society to contribute to improve the public good. But I think there’s a bigger message here, and that is that we have to work together as a society to improve our collective state. </p><p></p><p>Also, the quotation is from John F. Kennedy’s inaugural address. It means that rather being concerned with how individuals can benefit from the actions of the government (as proxy for nation), they should be concerned with how their actions can benefit their government (as proxy for nation). As is apparent during the Coronavirus pandemic, Americans have a penchant for rugged individualism. Kennedy was trying to persuade the Americans of his time to be concerned for the greater good. </p><br />

                            4. Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                            5. Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

                            6. ACTIVITY 2: Create an Essay about the current Economic Situation in our Country. How does it affects our lives. How do you observe your parents to survive? And, what can you do to or contribute to make it less easier or what are your future plans to at least help. Write it in a margined long bond paper.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The current economic situation in our country is one of the biggest challenges that many people are facing. The recent economic downturn has hit the country hard, causing widespread job losses, decreased purchasing power, and an overall decline in the standard of living for many individuals and families. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these problems, leading to even more job losses, business closures, and economic instability.</p><p></p><p>The effects of the current economic situation are far-reaching and have a profound impact on our lives. For many people, the lack of job security and decreased purchasing power has led to increased stress, anxiety, and financial insecurity. This can be especially difficult for families who are trying to make ends meet and provide for their loved ones. In some cases, people have had to make difficult choices, such as cutting back on necessities such as food, healthcare, and education, in order to make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>In observing my parents, I can see the stress and difficulty they face in trying to survive in this economic climate. They work hard to provide for our family, but it often feels like there is never enough money to go around. Despite this, they remain optimistic and continue to work towards a better future for our family. They have had to make sacrifices, such as cutting back on spending and taking on multiple jobs, in order to make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>As a young person, I want to do my part to help make the current economic situation less difficult for those around me. One of the ways I can contribute is by being mindful of my spending and saving my money, so that I can support my family and others when they need it. In the future, I plan to continue my education and gain the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in my chosen career. This will enable me to provide for myself and my loved ones, and also help to contribute to the overall economic stability of our country.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the current economic situation in our country is a major challenge that affects us all. However, by working together, we can help to ease the burden and make life a little easier for everyone. Whether it is through making smart financial choices, supporting others, or investing in our own futures, we can all play a role in creating a brighter, more stable future for our country and our loved ones.</p><br />

                            15. ESSAY: Every year, our country is bombarded with typhoons, in which some are really strong ones. What do youthink is the reason why our country keeps on facing stronger and stronger typhoons? As a student, what can you domake your environment safer?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>E</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p></p><p>     The location of our country — bordered by the Philippine Sea to the east, the West Philippine Sea to the west, and the Celebes Sea to the south — is definitely one of the reasons why we are always prone to calamities especially storms and typhoon. Philippines is an archipelago and mostly composed of islands surrounded by bodies of water thus, we are inevitably the first destination of these calamities that are formed in oceans and seas near us.</p><p></p><p>     However, nowadays, the strength of the typhoons arriving at our country is indeed becoming too alarming. List of typhoons and super typhoons kept on happening, leaving Philippines devastated and almost rubbed out of the map. One of the observed causes behind these extremely destructing typhoons are the continuous deforestation, illegal mining and urbanization. </p><p>  </p><p>    People cut trees from mountains to make wood and income out of it. This results from loss of forests that are a very significant way to stop the floodings. Ilegal mining also ruins mountains, losing our gigantic barriers against strong winds and typhoons. The incessant expansion of infrastructures and establishments also rooted the intensified calamities. </p><p></p><p>    These are just one of the reasons why typhoons in our country are becoming stronger than before. The only way for us, especially youths, to make our environment safe again is to lessen the activities that causes environmental degradation. We can never stop people from needing woods, but we can always preserve our forests through making sure planting and replacing more trees. We can also keep our surroundings clean by means of having proper and effective waste management to solve the problems in flood. Recycling might be an overused word but it is indeed never outdated. </p><p></p><p>     There are a lot of little and simple things we can do for our nature. Let us allow even a short time to appreciate and take care of it.</p><br />

                            16. Essay 2: Why is Education Important in Our Society? Introduction Education is more than just learning from books, and it is a shame that a lot of schools do not see that it is more than just a curriculum and school score. A good education can teach a child how to learn so that the child may take up independent learning as an adult. Education may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. Persuasive point 1: The biggest selling point for education in our society is the fact that it helps people learn “how” to learn. It is not about the knowledge they accumulate, it is the way a child is taught how to “learn” things. A child may come away from school not knowing a lot of the course, but if that child has been taught how to learn, then that child may become an adult that learns everything he or she needs in life. Otherwise, that child may grow up to be a person that cannot see the obvious because he orshe cannot reason and consciously learn new things. Persuasive point 2 Education teaches people how to reason, and if they are taught how to reason well, then they help subdue their own thoughts of ignorance. For example, there are lots of posts and websites on the Internet about childhood vaccinations and how dangerous they are. Ignorant people than never learned how to reason will look at them, believe them and support them. If a person is taught how to reason then he or she will know how to recognize empirical evidence. Persuasive point 3 That person would look at all the people in the US that have had childhood injections (most of them) and then look at all the people with autism. They would reason that if childhood vaccinations caused autism then most of the people in the US would have autism. If a person is taught how to reason then that person may see how people that smoke seem more likely to develop emphysema than people that do not smoke. They would then reason there is a link between smoking and emphysema. This sort of reasoning can be taught in schools, and if children are not taught it then they walk around risking their children’s lives by not vaccinating them, and walk around smoking because their daddy smoked for years and it never hurt him. Persuasive point 4 Conclusion If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and hitting the factors of a curriculum. There will be a day when children start to hate learning because school put them off it for life (this already happens in some cases). Plus, without education teaching people how to reason things out and teaching them how to separate what is fact from what is faulty evidence, then our society will become more and more ignorant until a smarter country simply marches over and takes our country from under out ignorant noses. ACTIVITY 2 Directions. From the essay #2, complete this organizer with persuasive points for each of the paragraphs following the thesis statement below. Write your answer in your notebook following the format below. Thesis statement: I will show you the two best reasons why education is important in our society hi po pahelp po please needed napo​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Why is Education Important in Our Society:<p>One of the benefits of education is that the educational system teaches us how to obtain and develop critical and logical thinking and make independent decisions. When children become adults, they are faced with a lot of challenging issues – pay off your student loans, get a job, buy a car and a house, provide for your family, etc. However, if one has spent years educating themselves, they should be able to make sound decisions on these various quandaries. Not only are people able to form their own opinions, but they are also good at finding solid and reliable arguments and evidence to back up and confirm their decisions. !!</p><br />

                            18. ASSESS Directions: Identify if the following articles is an Informative essay or not. Write check (/) If It is an informative essay and cross (X) if not. 1. What can we do to have a healthy circulatory system? Don't smoke!...Take vitamin E to keep the arteries supple. Eat those fresh vegetables and fruit that supply you with antioxidants- very good for your heart. Eat fish instead of red meat - much better for your heart. 2. First identified in the 1950s, dengue is spread by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito; the first documented cases were in the Philippines and Thailand. The disease has since struck worldwide, with over 100 countries at risk and 390 million infections yearly. It takes 4-10 days to become obvious, with a high fever and flu-like symptoms. It does not have a cure. The only thing to be done is to maintain the patient's bodily fluids until the disease runs its course. It is crucial that dengue be detected early, as the proper medical attention can lower mortality from 20 percent to just under 1 percent. Left unchecked or identified, dengue kills. 3. Arroyo, who was recently re-elected to a third term as Pampanga representative, received her release papers from the Sandiganbayan after the high tribunal's ruling was released earlier in the day saying the antigraft court erred in its findings that the former President personally benefited from intelligence funds of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO). 4. True! -nervous-very, very dreadfully nervous i had been and am! but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses-not destroyed-not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily-how calmly I can tell you the whole story. 5. How to keep your hair healthy? Wash your hair two to three times a week. Avoid hot showers. Shampoo your scalp, not your roots. Towel-dry your hair before applying conditioner. Brush your hair twice a day, from the bottom up. Use a low-heat setting for hair-drying and point the nozzle down, not side-on. Try castor oil, hair oil and dry shampoo.nonsense=report or bannedright answer=brainlest and follow​</h2><br />

                            21. “Grow and Be Like the Molave” Manuel L. Quezon Manuel L. Quezon was the first President of the Philippines. He was a member of the Philippine Assembly in 1907 to 1909, resident commissioner to the US Congress in 1909-1916, and president of the Philippine Senate in 1916-1935. He was elected president on September 17, 1935. As president of the land, Quezon worked hard for the independence of our country, the development of the people and for a national language. National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave, industrious, self- reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbued with sound patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from trials and bitter strife of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind. The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights. The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among men. It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly they should be: morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited. I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength. We are Orientals. Orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. In the world of humanity, we look upon a quiet lake from which adventures and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow Filipinos to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self-discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace. 1.	What is the basis of national strength, according to the essay? Do you agree? Explain your answer. 2.	What are the peaks, valleys and deep chasms which could hinder the upward climb of mankind? 3.	What does the author want the Filipino to be? Can this goal be achieved? 4.	What values must we possess to be able to achieve the author’s perceived goal for us?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. According to the essay, the basis of national strength is the character of its citizenry. The author believes that a nation cannot be stronger than its parts, and its weakness is its failings, while its strength is its power. I partially agree with this statement because the citizenry's character is a crucial factor in a nation's strength, but it is not the only one. Factors such as the government, economy, and social structures contribute to a nation's strength.</p><p></p><p>2. The peaks, valleys, and deep chasms that could hinder the upward climb of humanity are the obstacles that prevent people from realizing their full potential, such as poverty, inequality, discrimination, corruption, and conflicts. These obstacles hinder progress and development, requiring potent social upheavals.</p><p></p><p>3. The author wants the Filipinos to be solid and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning, or the storm, and confident of their strength. The author also wants the Filipino to be morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited, and imbued with good patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness. I believe this goal can be achieved with proper education, training, and social support.</p><p></p><p>4. To achieve the author's perceived goal, we must possess self-discipline, courage, industry, self-reliance, purposefulness, patriotism, social ideals, and solid moral fibers. These values will enable us to develop our resources, advance our culture, promote social justice, and secure happiness and contentment for all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>ikaw nlang ang mag essay</strong></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>On the surface, the cause of climate change is easy to explain. We are pumping heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere and this is causing Earth to heat up with potentially catastrophic consequences. But why, with full awareness of what is happening, do we continue to abuse our planetary atmosphere, thereby jeopardizing our very survival as a species? This is not easy to explain.

</strong></p><p><strong>There must be a reason, right? Our behaviors and actions are invariably the result of our beliefs—our story—about who we are and our purpose for being. And this, it turns out, has everything to do with climate change. For example, imagine what it would be like if each of us understood that our purpose, our central mission, in life was to express gratitude, love, and kindness, not just toward each other, but for everything—breath, rock, soil, sun, moon, moth, meadow, mussel. Can you conjure an image of what such a world would be like and would feel like? Does it offer you a sense of calm and well-being? Clearly, if we had been living in this story of deep relatedness over the past hundred years, we wouldn’t be facing climate chaos today.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>But our story is different. We knowingly continue to exploit and abuse Earth’s animals and plants and soil and water and atmosphere because we experience ourselves as distinctly separate from Earth. After all, would you abuse something or someone you truly cherished? No. Abuse occurs when there is an absence of relationship, absence of care, absence of love; it occurs when we live in a state of alienation. A father who abuses his child is disconnected—alienated—from that child; a CEO of a multi-national company that abuses land and water is alienated from his Mother, Earth; the crew of an ocean trawler that bulldozes the ocean floor to harvest shrimp is alienated from the wonders of the sea; government leaders who wage war are alienated from human life.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>On the surface it is this story of separation that leads to such abusive behaviors but, still, this begs the question: Why have we become so separate, so alienated, so divorced from Mother Earth? What’s at the root of our separation? Elementary psychology offers an answer: The chaotic world that we humans are creating is a reflection (“projection,” in psychological terms) of our inner psychic worlds. Said differently: Our separation from Earth is a manifestation of a tragic separation—think, alienation—from ourselves. This self-alienation manifests in four realms: emotion, body, mind, and soul.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>2. Today, wherever people live, they don’t have to look far to confront inequalities. Inequality in its various forms is an issue that will define our time. Confronting inequalities has moved to the forefront of many global policy debates as a consensus has emerged that all should enjoy equal access to opportunity. ‘Leave no one behind’ serves as the rallying cry of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Overall, since the 1990s total global inequality (inequality across all individuals in the world) declined for the first time since the 1820s. Reinforcing this trend, we have mostly seen income inequality between countries decline. Yet income inequality within countries has risen, this is the form of inequality people feel on a daily basis.  </strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Inequalities are not only driven and measured by income, but are determined by other factors - gender, age, origin, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, class, and religion. These factors determine inequalities of opportunity which continue to persist, within and between countries. In some parts of the world, these divides are becoming more pronounced. Meanwhile, gaps in newer areas, such as access to online and mobile technologies, are emerging. The result is a complex mix of internal and external challenges that will continue to grow over the next twenty-five years.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3. Donate money, food or blood
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you’re unable to donate your time, many of those same organizations in your community will gladly accept financial support. Find reputable organizations in your neighborhood that are helping where it’s needed most. Your local food banks, too, are likely welcoming donations of canned or non-perishable items, as well as basic necessities.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Be responsible
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>One of the first and best ways to help your local community is to be mindful of federal, state or local guidelines aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. This means avoiding congregating in groups larger than 10, staying home when sick, maintaining safe distances (i.e., social-distancing) when in public, and being mindful of any other ordinances or orders issued by health or government officials.</strong></p><br />

(As fact-checkers have limited resources and cannot check all problematic content, the total volume of different kinds of coronavirus misinformation has almost certainly grown even faster.)</p><p>In terms of formats, most (59%) of the misinformation in our sample involves various forms of reconfiguration, where existing and often true information is spun, twisted, recontextualised, or reworked. Less misinformation (38%) was completely fabricated. Despite a great deal of recent concern, we find no examples of deep fakes in our sample. Instead, the manipulated content includes ‘cheap fakes’ produced using much simpler tools. The reconfigured misinformation accounts for 87% of social media interactions in the sample; the fabricated content, for 12%.</p><p>In terms of sources, top-down misinformation from politicians, celebrities, and other prominent public figures made up just 20% of the claims in our sample but accounted for 69% of total social media engagement. While the majority of misinformation on social media came from ordinary people, most of these posts seemed to generate far less engagement. However, a few instances of bottom-up misinformation garnered a large reach and our analysis is unable to capture spread in private groups and via messaging applications, likely platforms for significant amounts of bottom-up misinformation.</p><p>In terms of claims, misleading or false claims about the actions or policies of public authorities, including government and international bodies like the WHO or the UN, are the single largest category of claims identified, appearing in 39% of our sample.</p><p>In terms of responses, social media platforms have responded to a majority of the social media posts rated false by fact-checkers by removing them or attaching various warnings. There is significant variation from company to company, however. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>☺️</p><br />

How Our Cultural, Socio-Economic and Religious Background Have an Impact in Resolving the Covid 19 Pandemic in our Country?
by: Maricel Guevarra Veniegas
 The end is still not insight! Perhaps most of you will agree that the end of this pandemic which we have been battling off with nearly two years was still uncertain. There are many lives lost and victims who are fighting for their lives. Schools were still closed, our economy continued to slow down, and our movements were restricted. For Juan dela Cruz but not with Uncle Sam and other neighboring countries who seem to live back to normal. But why? What are the contributing factors why we can’t go back to our normal lives well in fact other countries can?
Cultural background. As for the latest statistics it was found out that rising cases of Covid 19 is the spread among families. Reported news showed that the virus spread fastly among households and family members. Filipinos are known to have a culture of close family ties. Many extended families whereas parents, married children and sometimes even grandparents are living under one roof. In addition, Filipinos have a culture of having too many celebrations and karaoke will never be absent. With this kind of belief, the spread of viruses is being hastened up. 
Socio-economic background. When strict implementation of quarantine was made many Filipinos resisted clamoring that they will not die with the virus but with famine since their daily needs depend on their livelihood. The Philippines is a developing country almost 75 – 80 percent of its citizens are on the poverty line hence these quarantines will even push them into poverty line. So, by no choice, they continue to earn a living despite the threat of being contaminated with the virus to feed their hungry mouth. Hence, cutting down the number of cases in the country is challenging on the government’s part since Filipinos need to continue earning.
Religious background. Among all the contributing factors presented this might be the least. Though Filipinos were said to be religious, the government successfully implemented minimum health protocols in religious gathering and even halted mass gathering that has something to do with religious tradition like fiesta, baptismal and the like.
To sum it up, the cultural and socio-economic background of the Filipinos have an impact in slowing down the mitigation of the pandemic. The pandemic did not change how we Filipinos live by culture and by our economic status. We continue to live together with our family and earn our living even if it will mean risking and losing our lives against the Covid virus.</h2><br />
