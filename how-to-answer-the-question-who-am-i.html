Which do you think comes first? Chickens or eggs.
To me eggs are first because forsooth, without eggs there will certainly be no chickens, you can see this from the life cycle of chickens, how do you think a chicken will be born if there is no egg cracking at all? describing the life cycle, you will realize it, that is my explanation, thank you!

Which do you think comes first? Chickens or eggs.
To me eggs are first because forsooth, without eggs there will certainly be no chickens, you can see this from the life cycle of chickens, how do you think a chicken will be born if there is no egg cracking at all? describing the life cycle, you will realize it, that is my explanation, thank you! No hate comments please, I am narrowly explaining my answer, but if I see one, I am unreservedly fine with that because who am I to be mad, it's either your facts or opinions, thank you once again!</h2><br />
