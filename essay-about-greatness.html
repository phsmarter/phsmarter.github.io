                                                   "Greatness"<br /><br /><br />What is greatness? We may all consider what it means or what it stands for but in reality, it defines who we are and what we are capable of achieving. Greatness is a concept of a state of superiority affecting a person, object or place. It can also be referred to individuals who possess a natural ability to be better than others.<br /><br />Every human being each strive and aspire to be great, but only a handful of people know what it is, and fewer strive to achieve it. We are taught to strive for perfection to be great in life. As Shakespeare wrote, “Some are born great; some achieve greatness; some have greatness thrust upon them.” <br /><br />Greatness has its own rewards such as fame and wealth. There can be greatness in every one; we just have to approach it.<br />

Fields asks excellent questions that helps us, the eager students, understand someone’s successful career and journey. As Millman shares her story of reinventing herself in her 30s in the pursuit of doing what she loves, going through a divorce, being homeless and jobless, she talks about a desire for greatness and says it in a way that reflects what many of us may feel.</p><p>Jonathan Field asks Millman if she ever saw greatness within herself. Millman responds [emphasis by me]:</p><p>“No, no, no. And that has been a lifelong process in trying to uncover. I desire greatness, and I’m dogged, and incredibly persistent, and want so badly to be great, but there never has been a moment in my life that I actually have felt that I was great. But I desire it so much and want it so badly, that I can’t help but try to keep achieving something that might be close to it.”</p><p>Do you have a desire for greatness? I think many of us do, but like Millman, we rarely feel that greatness residing within us. And so we go searching for it, for good or ill. Some people find it in an artistic endeavor, like drawing or writing books or starting a business. Others may find it, however fleeting, in the purchase of name-brand items and the amount of likes they get on a selfie.</p><p>What’s vitally important is that if you identify with this desire for greatness, if you crave it even in the midsts of all your trials and tribulations, perhaps this quote from Epictetus could provide a sense of guidance [emphasis by me]:</p>Philosophy’s main task is to respond to the soul’s cry; to make sense of and thereby free ourselves from the hold of our griefs and fears.Philosophy calls us when we’ve reached the end of our rope. The insistent feeling that something is not right with our lives and the longing to be restored to our better selves will not go away. Our fears of death and being alone, our confusion about love and sex, and our sense of impotence in the face of our anger and outsized ambitions bring us to ask our first sincere philosophical questions.It’s true: there is no obviously apparent meaning to our lives. Cruelty, injustice, bodily discomfort, illness, annoyances, and inconveniences big and small are the prosaic facts of any day. So what do we do about this? How do we—in spite of the pain and suffering in the outside world and our own wayward emotions—live ennobled lives rather than succumbing to a despairing numbness and merely coping like a mule with tedium and unbidden responsibilities?When the soul cries out, it is a sign that we have arrived at a necessary, mature stage of self-reflection. The secret is not to get stuck there dithering or wringing your hands, but to move forward by resolving to heal yourself. Philosophy asks us to move into courage. Its remedy is the unblinking excavation of the faulty and specious premises on which we base our lives and our personal identity.<p>I wish this was on a billboard on every college campus.</p><p>Debbie Millman also runs a podcast called Design Matters. She has done about 200 interviews and shares this one nugget of wisdom:</p><p>The one common denominator that I share with anybody that feels self-loathing or insecurity in their 20s or 30s or 40s or 50s is, don’t give up hope that that might not ever go away—because I think it does.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Traveling alone can be a great idea for many reasons. First and foremost, it allows you to be in complete control of your itinerary and decisions. You can go where you want, when you want, and do what you want without having to consult anyone else. This can be especially liberating if you are someone who is used to always having to consider the preferences and needs of others.</p><p>Furthermore, traveling alone can be a great way to challenge yourself and build confidence. Navigating unfamiliar places, trying new activities, and meeting new people can all be intimidating, but also incredibly rewarding experiences. By doing these things on your own, you can push yourself out of your comfort zone and learn more about your own capabilities.</p><p>Additionally, traveling alone can be a great opportunity for self-reflection and personal growth. Without the distractions and obligations that come with traveling with others, you can have the time and space to truly immerse yourself in new experiences and think deeply about your life and goals.</p><p>In my opinion, one of the best things about traveling alone is the opportunity to meet new people. When you are by yourself, you are more likely to strike up conversations with locals and other travelers, which can lead to fascinating conversations and even lifelong friendships.</p><p>Of course, there are also potential drawbacks to traveling alone, such as feeling lonely or being more vulnerable to safety risks. However, these can be mitigated by careful planning and taking necessary precautions.</p><p>Overall, I believe that traveling alone can be a wonderful experience that offers many benefits. It allows you to be in control of your own adventure, challenge yourself, and grow as a person. It can also open up new social connections and provide a unique opportunity for self-discovery.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Wonders of Science</p><p></p><p>Introduction</p><p></p><p>Science is everywhere from an ordinary pen to a printing machine, from a paper airplane to space shuttle. Science is an integral part of our daily life. Science has made our life easy and comfortable with its innovations. Science has changed every field of life. Impossible things have become possible.</p><p></p><p>Gifts of Science</p><p></p><p>Thousands of things we use in our daily life are the gift of science. Here is a look at some of these:</p><p></p><p>Electricity – The invention of electricity led to an incredible change for the human civilization. Electricity helps run trains, heavy machinery, industries or other heavy wagons. Air conditioners, electric fans, electric heaters, lights have made our life more comfortable. Basically, all the scientific technologies rest on electricity.</p><p></p><p>Medicine and Surgery – Science has given wonderful medicines which give immediate relief to us. Science has helped overcome many dangerous and deadly diseases. Many vaccinations and medicines have been discovered to save people from different diseases. Now, almost every part of the human body can be transplanted by surgery. This can give us eyes to see, ears to hear and legs to walk. Scientists are innovating new and improved methods for surgeries. Medical science has undergone unbelievable improvements. Blood transfusion and organ transplantation are now possible. The invention of X-Ray, Ultrasonography, ECG, MRI, Penicillin, etc has made diagnoses of problems much easier.</p><p></p><p>Travelling and Transportation – Science has made our traveling fast and comfortable. We can reach any part of the world within few hours. We can travel by buses, cars, trains, ships, airplanes and other vehicles. They not only carry us but also transport goods and materials to faraway places quickly and safely.</p><p></p><p>Communication – Science has brought about a great change in the way of communication. This is not that time when we have to wait for a long time for our letter’s reply. This is the time when we can talk to our relatives even if they are too far away from us. We can talk to them and can even see them on our mobile phones. We can contact them from any part of the world. Mobiles and internet has helped reduce distance between people.</p><p></p><p>Agriculture – Science has proven to be a real friend for farmers. Many innovations and discoveries help farmers grow good quality crop. Harvesting machines, Tractors, Manures and good quality seeds are the gift of science to a farmer. In dairy business, types of machinery are helping to grow their business. Science has improved their lifestyle.</p><p></p><p>Entertainment – The first means of entertainment science has gave us was Radio. People used to listen to songs and news on it. But now science has amazed us by its new innovations in the field of entertainment. Now, we can watch T.V. on our mobiles. We can watch live telecast everywhere. We can watch videos on mobiles, T.V and also on computers. We cannot imagine our lives without these.</p><p></p><p>Education and Industry – Science has urbanized our education and trade sector. The innovation of printing, typing, binding, etc has boosted our education system. Similarly, from invention of needle, scissors, and sewing machine to the invention of heavy industrial machinery has done wonders in the industrial field.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion</p><p></p><p>Science has given us various gifts but it can also be used to harm human beings. It has given us rifles as well as bullet-proof jackets. It depends on us as to how we use science – for the welfare of humanity or for the destruction of humanity. We must use science for enhancing our lifestyle and spreading smiles and not for giving tears to someone. Stop the violence and spread happiness everywhere.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Being kind towards others in times of great need is like planting a seed in barren soil. Just as a seed needs nourishment and care to grow and flourish, people in need also require compassion and support to overcome their struggles.</p><p></p><p>In times of crisis, such as a natural disaster or a global pandemic, it is easy to become overwhelmed with fear and uncertainty. However, it is during these times that kindness and generosity are needed the most. By offering a helping hand or a listening ear, we can provide comfort and hope to those who are suffering. We can give a word of encouragement, a listening ear, or a simple gesture of kindness.</p><p></p><p>Just like a garden needs a variety of different plants to thrive, a community needs a diverse range of acts of kindness to support those in need. It is important to remember that every act of kindness, no matter how small, can make a significant impact in someone's life. For example, a small donation to a local food bank, or a few hours spent volunteering at a homeless shelter, can go a long way in helping to alleviate the suffering of those in need.</p><p></p><p>Being kind towards others in times of great need is also like a chain reaction. Just as a chain reaction starts with a small spark and then explodes into something big, an act of kindness can also have a ripple effect. It can inspire others to pay it forward and do the same.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, being kind towards others in times of great need is like planting a seed in barren soil, it is essential to nourish and support those who are suffering. Every act of kindness, no matter how small, can make a significant impact in someone's life and it can also inspire others to do the same. By being kind, we can help to create a more compassionate and supportive community for all. </p><p></p><br />

                        <p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Bonifacio was born of poor parents in Manila and had little formal education, working as a messenger and warehouse keeper before becoming involved in revolutionary activity. He was, however, well-read. Unlike the nationalist poet and novelist José Rizal, who wanted to reform Spanish rule in the Philippines, Bonifacio advocated complete independence from Spain. In 1892 he founded the Katipunan in Manila, modelling its organization and ceremony on that of the Masonic order.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Katipunan at first grew slowly, but by 1896 it had an estimated 100,000 members and branches not only in Manila but also in central Luzon and on the islands of Panay, Mindoro, and Mindanao. Its members were mostly workers and peasants; the urban middle class supported reform rather than revolution.</p><p>In August 1896 Bonifacio led the long-planned insurrection on Luzon; but his forces were defeated by Spanish troops, and he was forced to retreat to Montalban in the north, while Emilio Aguinaldo, one of his lieutenants, carried on resistance. </p><p></p><p></p><p>As the Spanish systematically routed the insurrectos, it became increasingly clear that Bonifacio was an ineffective military leader. In March 1897 a convention at Tejeros named Aguinaldo, rather than Bonifacio, president of a new Philippine republic. Refusing to recognize the convention, Bonifacio tried to establish his own rebel government. In April 1897 Aguinaldo had Bonifacio arrested and tried for treason; he was executed by a firing squad.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Kindness is a virtue that is rarely found these days. People these days are so busy gratifying their own needs and desires that they overlook that of the others. Being kind to others is out of question for most.
</p><p>
</p><p>If we, as human beings, are greedy and selfish, and show hatred, jealousy and anger, we are far from being kind. Our deeds, words and thoughts then reveal only unkindness. Kindness is an important quality for life to flourish.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Kindness is the act of being considerate and helpful towards other people. Kindness is the key to changing the perception of people towards each other. It helps people to develop empathy towards other people. It is a good way to help students to understand the importance of empathy which can play a big role in establishing human relationships. Kindness is not only important in small communities. It can be a key element that is needed to unite different communities. Kindness is required in society as it helps to build societies. It can help to decrease the number of misunderstandings and create an environment with fewer conflicts. Students can find sample papers on kindness from writing services websites. Although thinking of kindness essay plan and structure is important, special attention should also be placed on how to outline an interesting introduction and conclusion for essays on kindness.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>HOPE IT HELPS TYSM UwU</strong></p><p></p><br />

Choosing someone means that you also grow with all that comes up. You forgive. You accept things in each other. The state of being in a relationship can be harmonious until something disturbing comes up. Then you begin to shift from being happy to being whatever. To be added choosing someone and being with someone you love and who loves you will  become or supposed to be mutual. But in case one will have to choose, I'd say go for the one you love. It's true that the person who holds power in the relationship is the one who is less interested or less invested</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

They don’t necessarily aspire to become leaders but rather focus on achieving their goals and making a positive impact on others. The quote emphasizes that leadership is not about the position or title but rather about the actions taken to achieve a common goal.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            19. Write a short essay about what is the best reading style or technique for reading great books and the best that suits you.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Reading is a personal and subjective activity, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to reading great books. However, there are certain reading styles and techniques that can enhance your reading experience and help you get the most out of the books you read.</p><p>One of the most effective reading techniques is active reading. This involves engaging with the text actively by asking questions, making connections, and drawing conclusions. Active reading encourages critical thinking and helps you retain information more effectively. To read actively, it is important to take notes, underline or highlight important passages, and ask yourself questions about the text as you read.</p><p>Another effective reading technique is slow reading. Slow reading involves taking your time with the text and reading it carefully and attentively. This technique is particularly useful for complex or dense texts that require a deeper understanding. Slow reading allows you to absorb the material more thoroughly and to notice details and nuances that might be missed in a faster read.</p><p>Furthermore, there is no one best reading style, and the best technique is the one that suits you the most. For example, some people prefer to read in silence, while others like to read with background noise. Some prefer to read in short bursts, while others like to read for long stretches at a time. Experiment with different styles and techniques to find what works best for you.</p><p>Personally, I find a combination of active reading and slow reading to be the most effective for me. I like to take notes, underline passages, and ask questions as I read, while also taking my time with the text to ensure I fully understand it. I also like to read in silence to minimize distractions and allow myself to focus on the material.</p><p>In conclusion, the best reading style or technique for reading great books varies from person to person. However, active reading and slow reading are two effective techniques that can enhance your reading experience and help you get the most out of the books you read. Experiment with different styles and techniques to find what works best for you and stick with it.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            21. Make a 100-word essay about
trends and fads and cite some
examples of trend or fad that gives
a great impact to you as a senior
high school student</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The words “Charleston”, “Stutz Bearcat”, and “Raccoon Coat” date back to the 1920s, when young males sought to re-establish themselves in their culture through fashionable dress codes, expensive cars, and excellent dancing skills. Nothing has changed since then: raccoon coats are no longer fashionable, but trends and fads continue to dominate the hearts and minds of people, giving them a false sense of belonging to a privileged class.</p><p></p><p>In Shulman’s story, as well as in the real world, a raccoon coat used to be a symbol of style and privilege among male college students. For Petey Bellows, the author’s roommate, a raccoon coat is a matter of life vs. death: he wants a raccoon coat above anything in the world. He knows that to have a raccoon coat means to “be in the swim” (Shulman).</p><p></p><p>Petey believes that there is no way for him to outperform his peers other than to own a piece of fashionable clothes. He does not realize that being “in the swim” is the same as being lost in a gray crowd of people. That raccoon coats are unsanitary and weight too much means nothing to Petey (Shulman). He treats clothes as the sign of his privileged position and personal well being.</p><p></p><p>In the 1920s, the revival of raccoon coats was accompanied by the returning popularity of Charleston, which rapidly grew into a social mania. Charleston was inseparable from fashion. Those who did not follow the trend would doom themselves to social oblivion, isolation, and even rejection. At that time, a young student wearing a raccoon coat and dancing Charleston would be a secret dream for dozens of girls. Undoubtedly, a fashionable car added to the picture of personal prosperity.</p><p></p><p>Stutz Bearcat was one of the most fashionable cars in the 1920s.Shulman recalls how his father used to wear his raccoon coat “in his Stutz Bearcat in 1925”. The car carried a deep, complex social meaning. It was a symbol of prosperity, a sign of privilege, and a symptom of wealth and fashion.</p><p></p><p>Shulman suggests that, back in his college years, his father used to be extremely fashionable. Simultaneously, the author is absolutely indifferent to these things. He tries to show that clothes, cars, and dancing skills have nothing to with personal uniqueness. Unfortunately, he fails to recognize the significance of these social codes, until his girl leaves to Petey, who wears a raccoon coat.Nothing has changed since then. Raccoon coats are no longer fashionable, but trends and fads continue to dominate people’s hearts and minds. Ferraris, personal airplanes, Armani clothes and fashionable after-parties create an image of enormous material wealth. Like many years before, these items symbolize a social privilege but tell nothing about individuality and uniqueness.</p><p></p><p>The media spread the message of materialism, turning money into a self-goal. Inanimate objects replace individuality and uniqueness. They give a false sense of belonging to a privileged class but leave little room for personal development and growth</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Trends and fads come and go, but their social significance is difficult to underestimate. In the 1920s, raccoon coats, Stutz Bearcats and Charleston were the symbols of a privileged social position. Thousands of male college students would do anything to wear fashionable clothes and develop unique dancing skills; otherwise, they would doom themselves to oblivion, isolation, and social rejection.</p><p></p><p>Nothing has changed since then: raccoon coats are no longer fashionable, but trends and fads continue to dominate people’s hearts and minds.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A teacher plays a significant role in shaping the future of a student. A good teacher can make a significant difference in a student's life by inspiring them to achieve greatness. However, not all teachers are created equal. There are mediocre teachers who fail to inspire their students and create a positive impact on their lives. In contrast, some teachers go above and beyond to become great teachers who inspire their students to achieve their full potential.</p><p></p><p>A mediocre teacher is someone who is content with simply going through the motions of teaching. They may deliver their lessons in a monotone voice and fail to engage their students in the learning process. They may also lack the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively teach their subject matter. A mediocre teacher can be described as someone who is just doing their job without any passion or dedication.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, a good teacher is someone who is passionate about teaching and genuinely cares about their students. They have the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively teach their subject matter and engage their students in the learning process. A good teacher is also someone who is approachable and willing to help their students when they are struggling. They go the extra mile to ensure that their students understand the material and are prepared for exams.</p><p></p><p>A superior teacher is someone who not only has the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively teach their subject matter but also demonstrates how to apply that knowledge in real-life situations. They use practical examples to make their lessons more relatable and engaging. A superior teacher is also someone who is constantly learning and improving their teaching methods. They are always looking for ways to improve their teaching skills and make their lessons more effective.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the great teacher is someone who inspires their students to achieve greatness. They are passionate, knowledgeable, and dedicated to their craft. They use their passion to inspire their students and create a positive impact on their lives. A great teacher is someone who goes beyond teaching the subject matter and helps their students develop life skills, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, a mediocre teacher is content with simply going through the motions of teaching, while a good teacher is passionate about teaching and genuinely cares about their students. A superior teacher demonstrates how to apply knowledge in real-life situations, while the great teacher inspires their students to achieve greatness. It is essential to have great teachers who inspire and create a positive impact on their students' lives as they shape the future of our society.</p><br />

                        <strong>All About Kindness</strong><p><strong>Kindness </strong>is seen all around us. God is shown to be the most powerful being in the cosmos, as well as the creator of the universe who is compassionate to all of his creation. <strong>Kindness</strong> is a trait we see in all of God's creation. People who are kind are visible. Trees, the sun, and other living things are all friendly to us.</p><p>Nature, by virtue of its own being, demonstrates benevolence. Plants and trees provide us with so much. The trees and vegetation that surround us are essential to our survival. Similarly, the sun provides warmth, light, and energy to everyone on the planet. Its basic existence is to provide us with these life-giving gifts.</p><p><strong>Kindness </strong>is the ability to share and care for others. <strong>Kindness </strong>is demonstrated when we can give what we have and care for the well-being of others. Similarly, we are kind if we feel for people when they are in distress and strive to alleviate their suffering by assisting them in any manner we can.</p><p>We are far from being nice if we are greedy and selfish, displaying wrath, jealously, and fury. Then our actions, words, and ideas show nothing but cruelty. <strong>Kindness</strong> is a necessary trait for life to thrive.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What is kindness? explain what is kindness​ brainly.ph/question/20696868</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Essay about being Kind ( 200 words )</p><p></p><p>Kindness simply means being good to people around us. It can be done by being polite to them, offering them emotional support, helping them financially, boosting their morale or by simply being supportive to them. Kind words and kind deeds done by us are not only a boon for the recipient but are also a blessing to us. When we help others with their tasks, are polite to them and do other such acts of kindness it gives us a sense of accomplishment and joy.</p><p></p><p>Kindness has been described differently in different religious books and literature in the past. However, they all echo the same thought. All of them advocate that human beings must show kindness to other human beings as well as other creatures. We must be polite, friendly and helpful. While we should exhibit kindness we must not do it with the aim of getting anything in return. Kindness is a selfless act.</p><p></p><p>If God has been kind enough to give us the things we need we must be kind to others and render help in whatever way we can. As Lord Buddha said, “A generous heart, kind speech and a life of service and compassion are the things that renew humanity”.</p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>MY LIFE DURING PANDEMIC</strong><p></p><p>In the start of isolation, as the world dialed back, I could at last invest in some opportunity to unwind, observe a few shows, figure out how to be a superior cook and pastry specialist, and be more dynamic in my extracurriculars. I have a ton of things to be appreciative for. I particularly like that I'm ready to reside in an agreeable house and have gotten the chance to invest more energy with my family. This has really been the first time in quite a while in which all of us are ready to try and eat suppers together each and every day. In any event, when my sibling and I were youthful (family), my folks would be working and now and again return home late, so we didn't dependably eat suppers together. In the start of the quarantine I recollect my family discussing that it was so great to at long last have suppers together, and my sibling kidding, "it just took a pandemic to unite all of us," which I giggled about at that point (yet it's reality).</p><p></p><p>Before sufficiently long, we'll be in every way back to going to better places and we'll be isolated indeed. So I'm grateful for my everyday environment at this moment. Concerning my companions, despite the fact that we're separated, I really do in any case feel like I can be in contact with them through video visit possibly now and then significantly more in contact than previously. I think a many individuals simply possess somewhat more energy for others at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In spite of the fact that there are still a great deal of things to be appreciative for, stress has gradually dominated, and work has been overpowering. I've forever been an individual who normally appreciates going to classes, taking on more work than I need to, and being dynamic overall. Yet, recently I've felt overwhelmed with how much work given, to the point that my days have obscured into online tasks, Zoom classes, and endless gatherings, with a bit of baking desserts and random looking on Youtube. Overall, my life during these occasions is significantly unique in relation to anything the greater part of us have at any point experienced, and now and again it tends to be incredibly overpowering and upsetting particularly as far as school for me. Online classes don't give similar climate and collaborations as in-person classes and are by a wide margin not as agreeable. Yet, toward the day's end, I realize that in each situation there is continually something to be grateful for, and I'm thankful for my circumstance at the present time. While the world has dialed back and my stress has inclined up, I'm gradually starting to change in accordance with it.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>My life as a student during the pandemic? </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/7184885</p><p>#LETSTUDY</p><br />
