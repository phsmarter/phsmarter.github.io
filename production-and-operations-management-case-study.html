                                            Case Study:
Lito Catapang, Operations Manager, and Baby Rambo, Maintenance Manager, both report to Dante Montecarlo, General Manager of Asbok Chemicals. Lito and Baby are about at the same age, well-educated and have extensive experience in their respective fields. It would be expected that these two individuals would compliment each other and be the answer to every general manager’s prayer. Unfortunately, that is not the case.
For some reasons, Lito and Baby find it necessary to challenge each other’s decisions and ideas anytime they have a mutual problem to solve, and they argue constantly in staff meetings. Recently Baby Rambo began to talk to peers in an effort to get them on her side. Lito learning of this, went to Dantee Montecarlo and demanded that he call Baby in and tell her to stop. Lito did not realize Dante Montecarlo was aware of what was happening. Nor did he now Dante had just learned that Lito had deliberately change a unit turn-around schedule so that it would fall during a period when the maintenance department already had a peak workload.
The matter has been further complicated by the fact that the employees of the two managers have taken side and join the fray. Productive work has come a standstill.

CASE Study 1Echo ElectronicsPaul Sanchez is the production manager for Echo Electronics, a small company that makes and distributes communications equipment. Paul’s direct subordinates are the supervisors of the four production departments in the company’s manufacturing plant. Six months ago, the engineering manager at Echo Electronics proposed a plan to install new computerized workstations to increase productivity in the plant. It seemed to be a good idea to Paul, and he welcomed the change. The CEO also ap- proved the plan, and the new equipment was installed immediately.Three months later, Paul was surprised and disappointed to find that the ex- pected increase in productivity did not occur. In fact, productivity and quality actually decreased. The marketing manager told Paul that several of their best customers complained about receiving Echo equipment that was defective. Paul does not believe that the problem lies with the new workstations. Technicians from the firm that built the workstations recently checked them and found that they were operating properly. Paul talked to someone at another company that uses the workstations, and his contact reported that they were having great success with them.When Paul discussed the problem with his four production supervisors, he found that they shared his concern but did not agree among themselves about the cause of the problem. Reasons given for the decline in performance included poor design of the workstations, inadequate training of the production workers who operate them, and lack of financial incentives for increasing productivity. The supervisors also told Paul that the production workers have strong feelings about the workstations. Morale de- clined, and two employees quit because they were upset about the changes made in the way the work is done.This morning Paul received a phone call from the CEO who just received the pro- duction figures for last month and was calling to express concern about them. The CEO indicated that the problem was Paul’s to solve, but he must take immediate steps to deal with it. The CEO wants to know by next week what steps Paul will take to reverse the decline in productivity and product quality.SOURCE: Adapted from a case by Timothy R. Hinkin and used with his permission.QUESTIONS1. What actions could Paul have taken to prevent the problem?2. What steps should Paul take now to deal with the problem?​</a>

Help Jana and Jino identify the government agency that could help them in these situations. 1. Jino is a resident of San Antonio Province. He is a senior high school student. Because of the new normal way of living due to the pandemic he decided to buy a new laptop for his study. He bought a laptop with serial no. 87439 from MNP Electronics for Php 15,500.00. The company gave 1-year warranty and 6 months money back guaranty. He was told that in case of trouble or malfunction before or while using the gadget all of his money will be given back to him immediately or item replacement. He purchased the laptop but experienced a lot of problems. He sent his complaints repeatedly and requested for a replacement but had fallen on deaf ears. He also wrote letters to the manager but all he got was a reassurance from them that they are looking into the matter. Government Agency: _______________________________________________________ What advise can you give to Jino? _______________________________________________ 2. One summer, Jana spent her vacation in their province. She was shocked when she witnessed the current situation of solid waste management in their town. The town has become a pile of trash. The officials seldom visit their town to check the works of their staff. Their method of operation is totally outdated. Most of their trucks are out of order. The streets are littered with heaps of domestic garbage. People are so helpless that they have no other choice but to burn the solid waste to get rid of it. Burning of solid waste creates poisonous toxic gases which are extremely harmful to people’s health. Who can help Jana and her town?

                                            pa help plsCase Study: Solar Cell ManufacturerSolar Cell is a manufacturing company based in southern part of Korea that manufactures different types of solar-powered products. They have customers based in the local parts of the country and abroad. The company is growing fast due to the increased demand for non-conventional energy. The CEO of the company associates their success in the use of control charts for their manufacturing procedures which lets them control the quality of their final outputs.Although the company has been quite successful in the use of control charts for their manufacturing operations, it has extended the applications of control charts in their non-manufacturing sectors such as HR and Finance. The reason for this implementation is because of the majorincrease in employee attrition and significantly large budget allotted to several departments of the company. Based on the result of the exit interviews, most of the employees who left the company claimed that they experienced work-life imbalance particularly for the operators since they were required to work in extended hours in circumstances when their substitute partners would not be able to arrive to work on time or would not be able to report to work at all. The minority of the resigned employees thought that they were misaligned and not trained for their job, they felt undervalued and afraid that growth opportunities were not present in the company. Another problem area that the top management has observed involves the finance team of the company. The management have found out that allotted budgets in some departments or work units of the firm are unrealistic, inaccurate, and unreasonable. After reviewing all the problem areas of the organization, the company’s quality assurance team suggested the use of control charts in the two (2) departments where the problems are prevalent.However, another difficult situation arises due to the resistance of the employees toward the use of control charts which gains several complaints from the employees pertaining to exhausting additional workload since they would have to monitor and notate the different outflows and inflows in their major and minor day-to-day operations. There was a clear lack of understanding of the benefits of control charts and the need for change using control charts as a catalyst for change. The senior management team decided to provide a one-day awareness program for the HR and Finance people so that they can understand the expectations and the need for the control chart initiative within the company. Moreover, an executive awareness was also introduced to all senior management team so that they would understand the importance and benefits of control charts in the business.​Follow the suggested outline below in answering the case study:

                                            1 / 2Case Study #4BUILDING COST-SAVING CAPABILITIESRyanair is one of Europe’s largest low-cost carriers and one of the world’s most profit- able airlines. Founded in 1985 by Christy Ryan, Liam Lonergan, and Tony Ryan, the original airline offered service from Waterford in southeastern Ireland to Gatwick in London. In its first full year of operation under partial European Union (EU) deregulation, the small airline obtained permission to challenge the duopoly of Air Lingus and British Airways on the Dublin–London route. With two routes and two planes, this small Irish airline was off and running. By 1991, the airline had been running continuous losses; it abandoned its business-class product and discontinued its frequent flyer club.To save the company from ruin and make the airline profitable, Michael O’Leary, the CEO, visited America to borrow ideas from Southwest Airlines, a well-established low- cost carrier. He returned with several key elements for a no-frills model, including the importance of quick turnaround times, no extras, and a single aircraft for operating efficiency. With an additional Ryan family investment of ð20 million, the firm emerged from restructuring as Europe’s first low-fare airline, making a profit for the first time. Deregulation of the European airline industry in 1992 gave carriers from any EU country the right to operate a schedule between other EU states, paving the way for Ryanair to begin launching new routes throughout Europe.Today the airline serves more than 42 million passengers, with 2007 profits of ð401.4 million. A comparison of 2007 to 2006 performance shows profit growth of 33 percent, traffic growth of 22 percent, revenue growth of 32 percent, and yield increases of 7 per- cent. Ryanair’s passenger numbers have grown by up to 25 percent per year for most of the last decade. With plans to double traffic and profits by 2012, Ryanair continues to execute on its low-cost strategy by offering low fares that generate increased passenger traffic while maintaining a dedication to cost containment and operating efficiencies.The key elements of Ryanair’s strategy are low fares to stimulate demand, and customer service in the form of punctuality, fewer lost bags, and fewer cancellations than its primary competitors had. To accomplish these activities, Ryanair stresses quick turn- around times for aircraft, and chooses point-to-point short-haul routes to secondary and regional airports versus hub-and-spoke service. Short-haul and point-to-point service allows for direct nonstop service and avoids the cost of service for connecting passengers, including baggage transfer and passenger assistance. These regional airports offer lower landing and handling charges, faster turnaround times, less congestion, and fewer terminal delays. Ryanair negotiates extremely aggressive contracts with its airports, demanding low fees as well as financial assistance with marketing and promotional campaigns. In subsequent contract renewal negotiations, the airline plays airports off against each other, threatening to withdraw services and deploy the aircraft elsewhere if the airport does not make further concessions.Lower operating costs also come from aircraft equipment costs and personnel productivity. Operating a fleet of aircraft with a single model, the Boeing 737-800 series pro- vides operating efficiencies in maintenance and pilot scheduling. Taking advantage of the slump in airplane2 / 2sales, the company ordered Boeing 737-800 series aircraft in 2001 at a substantial discount. Additional savings have come from more recent orders of aircraft without window shades, seat-back recline, or seat-back pockets. Reduced cleaning and repair costs for these planes have accompanied the savings of several hundred thousand dollars per aircraft when purchasing these bare-bones planes. Third parties are used at certain airports for passenger and aircraft handling, further lowering costs. Taking advantage of the Internet, direct selling to passengers through online bookings cuts out the cost of using travel agents, with the web site now handling 96 percent of all reservations. Ryanair does not employ an advertising agency, instead producing all of its advertising material in-house.With a clear and focused strategy as a low-cost carrier, future plans include manageable growth, continuing efforts to appeal the EU commission decision to prevent acquisition of Aer Lingus, and the possibility of entering into the long-haul market with a transatlantic low-cost airline.1.

Lito Catapang, Operations Manager, and Baby Rambo, Maintenance Manager, both report to Dante Montecarlo, General Manager of Asbok Chemicals. Lito and Baby are about at the same age, well-educated and have extensive experience in their respective fields. It would be expected that these two individuals would compliment each other and be the answer to every general manager’s prayer. Unfortunately, that is not the case.
For some reasons, Lito and Baby find it necessary to challenge each other’s decisions and ideas anytime they have a mutual problem to solve, and they argue constantly in staff meetings. Recently Baby Rambo began to talk to peers in an effort to get them on her side. Lito learning of this, went to Dantee Montecarlo and demanded that he call Baby in and tell her to stop. Lito did not realize Dante Montecarlo was aware of what was happening. Nor did he now Dante had just learned that Lito had deliberately change a unit turn-around schedule so that it would fall during a period when the maintenance department already had a peak workload.
The matter has been further complicated by the fact that the employees of the two managers have taken side and join the fray. Productive work has come a standstill.

CASE Study 1Echo ElectronicsPaul Sanchez is the production manager for Echo Electronics, a small company that makes and distributes communications equipment. Paul’s direct subordinates are the supervisors of the four production departments in the company’s manufacturing plant. Six months ago, the engineering manager at Echo Electronics proposed a plan to install new computerized workstations to increase productivity in the plant. It seemed to be a good idea to Paul, and he welcomed the change. The CEO also ap- proved the plan, and the new equipment was installed immediately.Three months later, Paul was surprised and disappointed to find that the ex- pected increase in productivity did not occur. In fact, productivity and quality actually decreased. The marketing manager told Paul that several of their best customers complained about receiving Echo equipment that was defective. Paul does not believe that the problem lies with the new workstations. Technicians from the firm that built the workstations recently checked them and found that they were operating properly. Paul talked to someone at another company that uses the workstations, and his contact reported that they were having great success with them.When Paul discussed the problem with his four production supervisors, he found that they shared his concern but did not agree among themselves about the cause of the problem. Reasons given for the decline in performance included poor design of the workstations, inadequate training of the production workers who operate them, and lack of financial incentives for increasing productivity. The supervisors also told Paul that the production workers have strong feelings about the workstations. Morale de- clined, and two employees quit because they were upset about the changes made in the way the work is done.This morning Paul received a phone call from the CEO who just received the pro- duction figures for last month and was calling to express concern about them. The CEO indicated that the problem was Paul’s to solve, but he must take immediate steps to deal with it. The CEO wants to know by next week what steps Paul will take to reverse the decline in productivity and product quality.SOURCE: Adapted from a case by Timothy R. Hinkin and used with his permission.QUESTIONS1. What actions could Paul have taken to prevent the problem?2. What steps should Paul take now to deal with the problem?​</h2><br />

Because of the new normal way of living due to the pandemic he decided to buy a new laptop for his study. He bought a laptop with serial no. 87439 from MNP Electronics for Php 15,500.00. The company gave 1-year warranty and 6 months money back guaranty. He was told that in case of trouble or malfunction before or while using the gadget all of his money will be given back to him immediately or item replacement. He purchased the laptop but experienced a lot of problems. He sent his complaints repeatedly and requested for a replacement but had fallen on deaf ears. He also wrote letters to the manager but all he got was a reassurance from them that they are looking into the matter. Government Agency: _______________________________________________________ What advise can you give to Jino? _______________________________________________ 2. One summer, Jana spent her vacation in their province. She was shocked when she witnessed the current situation of solid waste management in their town. The town has become a pile of trash. The officials seldom visit their town to check the works of their staff. Their method of operation is totally outdated. Most of their trucks are out of order. The streets are littered with heaps of domestic garbage. People are so helpless that they have no other choice but to burn the solid waste to get rid of it. Burning of solid waste creates poisonous toxic gases which are extremely harmful to people’s health. Who can help Jana and her town?

                            6. pa help plsCase Study: Solar Cell ManufacturerSolar Cell is a manufacturing company based in southern part of Korea that manufactures different types of solar-powered products. They have customers based in the local parts of the country and abroad. The company is growing fast due to the increased demand for non-conventional energy. The CEO of the company associates their success in the use of control charts for their manufacturing procedures which lets them control the quality of their final outputs.Although the company has been quite successful in the use of control charts for their manufacturing operations, it has extended the applications of control charts in their non-manufacturing sectors such as HR and Finance. The reason for this implementation is because of the majorincrease in employee attrition and significantly large budget allotted to several departments of the company. Based on the result of the exit interviews, most of the employees who left the company claimed that they experienced work-life imbalance particularly for the operators since they were required to work in extended hours in circumstances when their substitute partners would not be able to arrive to work on time or would not be able to report to work at all. The minority of the resigned employees thought that they were misaligned and not trained for their job, they felt undervalued and afraid that growth opportunities were not present in the company. Another problem area that the top management has observed involves the finance team of the company. The management have found out that allotted budgets in some departments or work units of the firm are unrealistic, inaccurate, and unreasonable. After reviewing all the problem areas of the organization, the company’s quality assurance team suggested the use of control charts in the two (2) departments where the problems are prevalent.However, another difficult situation arises due to the resistance of the employees toward the use of control charts which gains several complaints from the employees pertaining to exhausting additional workload since they would have to monitor and notate the different outflows and inflows in their major and minor day-to-day operations. There was a clear lack of understanding of the benefits of control charts and the need for change using control charts as a catalyst for change. The senior management team decided to provide a one-day awareness program for the HR and Finance people so that they can understand the expectations and the need for the control chart initiative within the company. Moreover, an executive awareness was also introduced to all senior management team so that they would understand the importance and benefits of control charts in the business.​Follow the suggested outline below in answering the case study:

                            7. 1 / 2Case Study #4BUILDING COST-SAVING CAPABILITIESRyanair is one of Europe’s largest low-cost carriers and one of the world’s most profit- able airlines. Founded in 1985 by Christy Ryan, Liam Lonergan, and Tony Ryan, the original airline offered service from Waterford in southeastern Ireland to Gatwick in London. In its first full year of operation under partial European Union (EU) deregulation, the small airline obtained permission to challenge the duopoly of Air Lingus and British Airways on the Dublin–London route. With two routes and two planes, this small Irish airline was off and running. By 1991, the airline had been running continuous losses; it abandoned its business-class product and discontinued its frequent flyer club.To save the company from ruin and make the airline profitable, Michael O’Leary, the CEO, visited America to borrow ideas from Southwest Airlines, a well-established low- cost carrier. He returned with several key elements for a no-frills model, including the importance of quick turnaround times, no extras, and a single aircraft for operating efficiency. With an additional Ryan family investment of ð20 million, the firm emerged from restructuring as Europe’s first low-fare airline, making a profit for the first time. Deregulation of the European airline industry in 1992 gave carriers from any EU country the right to operate a schedule between other EU states, paving the way for Ryanair to begin launching new routes throughout Europe.Today the airline serves more than 42 million passengers, with 2007 profits of ð401.4 million. A comparison of 2007 to 2006 performance shows profit growth of 33 percent, traffic growth of 22 percent, revenue growth of 32 percent, and yield increases of 7 per- cent. Ryanair’s passenger numbers have grown by up to 25 percent per year for most of the last decade.
