                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is critical to understand how to become acquainted with oneself. If you do, wonderful things will occur! Doors will open, your happiness will grow, and you will begin living your life according to your own desires, which will feel incredible. You will not feel as if you are living someone else's life or living in their shadow. You won't be unsure about what to do next. You will gain an insight of who you are and will make choices based on that knowledge. Additionally, you will be able to say no to individuals when necessary.One of the most gratifying aspects of knowing yourself is being able to hold your head high and confidently tell others who you are. That confidence will feel incredible, and others will admire you for it.I have faith in myself, my emotions, my actions, and my skills. I am pleased with myself! Second, I enjoy my own company. I was born with four limbs, perfect hearing, and eyes. I am grateful to God for allowing me to exist in this world. Regardless of the ups and downs, I never lose my grip on God. Perhaps this is why I am not discouraged by life. I am grateful that He gifted me with parents who reach their hands incessantly when I am in need and with others, particularly friends, who made me feel blessed with all of life's grandeur.Additionally, I am blessed with lovely siblings who inspire me on my life-long adventure. What more could I possibly ask? Individuals can put their trust in me. Though I occasionally unintentionally reveal a secret, I can still confidently state that I am trustworthy. I am receptive to constructive criticism and recommendations. It teaches me to accept my errors and flaws calmly, to analyse them and to consider my options in order to act appropriately. At times, I'm somewhat pessimistic.</p><br />

                        <p> </p><p>1.My philosophy on life is that you should live while you are alive and you should give others that same privilege. We shouldn’t judge people for the choices they make, because we all make bad decisions. You should do what you want with your life, as long as it makes you happy and causes no harm to others. Happiness is all we can hope for in this world and we have to strive to achieve it. We should help people when we can and graciously accept failures when we have to.</p><p> </p><p></p><br />
