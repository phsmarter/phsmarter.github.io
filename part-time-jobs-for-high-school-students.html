                                            Let's ApplyRead an example of an argumentative essay below. Then answer the activity thatfollow by completing the outline with necessary information on a separate sheet ofpaper.Every school day, more than seven thousand students become dropouts. Annually. that adds up to about 1.3 million students who will not graduate from high school with their peers as scheduled. Students should never drop out of high school because they will be far more likely to spend their lives periodically unemployed, on government assistance, or cycling in and out of the prison system.One reason that someone should not drop out of high school is that they are far more likely to struggle keeping a good job. Most places would prefer to hire a worker that as completed high school. This is important because even a person is capable of doing the job, the employer might overlook them simply because they are a quitter. Even if the dropout gets a job, others that are more educated are more likely to be promoted faster because they are more qualified. Therefore, a person that has dropped out will be forced to work at places that do not require much skill and thus, make less money. More specifically, high school dropouts earn 143 dollars less per13week than a worker with their diploma. This totals to nearly a 7,500 dollars difference each year, and that is if the dropout can keep their job. All in all, it is quite clear that nothing good will come from students dropping out of high school. Struggling to keep a job, relying on government assistance, and being in and out of prison are very realistic possibilities for the students who do not graduate. Do not be part of the 7,000-refuse to quit. When school gets tough, seek the help needed in order to graduate on time and help make the future brighter.1.IntroductionA. Hook: B. Thesis Statement:2.

More specifically, high school dropouts earn 143 dollars less per13week than a worker with their diploma. This totals to nearly a 7,500 dollars difference each year, and that is if the dropout can keep their job. All in all, it is quite clear that nothing good will come from students dropping out of high school. Struggling to keep a job, relying on government assistance, and being in and out of prison are very realistic possibilities for the students who do not graduate. Do not be part of the 7,000-refuse to quit. When school gets tough, seek the help needed in order to graduate on time and help make the future brighter.1.IntroductionA. Hook: B. Thesis Statement:2.

                            11. 1. Ben was a high school student. He knows about the importance of education so he decided to enroll. His parents were not high school graduate and don't have stable jobs. He decided to work as his part-time to finance his family income. Despite his busy schedule, he realizes that he hardly focuses on his study. If you were Ben, what will you do to continue his study despite of his situation? How will you prioritize your study?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If I were Ben, I'll focus on my study despite my busy schedule— so in that way i can prove to them or to my parents that I can do better. Time management is the key, like set time for me to study while another set of time for work. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps. </p><br />
