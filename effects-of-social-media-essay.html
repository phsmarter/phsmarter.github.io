                        <p>A gerund is a verbal. Before defining gerund, you should know first what a verbal is.</p>A <strong>verbal</strong> is basically a verb, but it does not function as a verb in a sentence. A verbal may act as a noun, adjective or adverb in a sentence.The three types of verbals are gerunds, participles and infinitives.<p>Meanwhile, a <strong>gerund</strong> is a verbal that acts as a <strong>noun</strong> in a sentence. It may be formed by using the base form of the verb + ing.</p><p>For example: work + ing = working</p><p>A <strong>participle </strong>is a verbal that acts as an adjective in a sentence. The two types of participles are the present and the past participle.</p>Present participle ends up in -ing like burning, chilling, thrillingPast participles may end in -ed if it is a regular verb like cooked and grilled. Irregular verbs may have different ending letters or different spellings like broken, fallen, burnt.<p></p><p>Interacting with people via social media is one of the habits of people nowadays. Their days would not be complete without social media. Some may feel bored when they are out of their social media accounts. Using social media may have advantages and disadvantages to the young people of this generation.</p><p></p><p>Social media connects two people together. Social media accounts help people to stay connected whenever and wherever they go. Social media accounts let young people communicate with their loved ones especially if they are working overseas.</p><p></p><p>In addition, social media helps young people to express themselves virtually. Expressing one's self is difficult for quiet and shy people. They tend to be embarrassed when they express themselves personally. Posting in their social media accounts help them to be inspired and do more for themselves.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, social media is also an avenue for cyber bullying and may get young people to feel ashamed and terrified of themselves. Bullying someone online may lead to different problems. Ranting and posting hate speech online ruin one's self esteem and may usually lead to depression.</p><p></p><p>Using social media accounts is inevitable in this generation. Young ones must learn to use it responsibly. </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>(100 Words)</p><p>Social media is a very controversial topic of discussion today as it can be argued to be both a blessing and a curse to our generation. Most people are of the opinion that the social media has brought down and destroyed every iota of physical human interaction at a very alarming rate and has changed how we view human relationships in this modern time. There are a lot of others with the opinion that social media has help improve and given us better options and ways of staying connected to those we love wherever they are in the world and we can disseminate news and information quicker through social media.</p><p><strong>Answer </strong><strong>&amp;</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Social media has become an integral part of modern society, connecting people from all walks of life and offering a platform for individuals to share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. However, the impact of social media on society is a topic of much debate, with opinions ranging from its positive contributions to its negative effects. In this essay, we will explore both the facts and opinions surrounding social media and its effects on society.</p><p></p><p>The facts surrounding social media are clear: it is a powerful tool that has transformed the way people interact and communicate with each other. Social media has made it easier for people to connect with friends and family, even if they are located in different parts of the world. It has also given individuals a platform to express their opinions and ideas on a global scale. Social media has enabled businesses to reach a wider audience and has opened up new avenues for marketing and advertising.</p><p></p><p>However, social media also has its negative effects. One of the main concerns is the spread of fake news and misinformation, which can be easily shared and amplified on social media platforms. This can lead to harmful consequences, such as the spread of conspiracy theories and the promotion of dangerous practices. Another negative effect of social media is the impact it can have on mental health. Studies have shown that excessive use of social media can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness.</p><p></p><p>Opinions about social media are often shaped by personal experiences and perspectives. Some people view social media as a force for good, allowing them to connect with others and share information. Others view it as a time-wasting distraction that promotes superficial relationships and shallow interactions. Still, others see social media as a dangerous tool that can be used to spread hate and misinformation.</p><p></p><p>Despite the varying opinions about social media, it is clear that it has become an integral part of modern society.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Social media has become an integral part of today's society, with billions of people using various social media platforms every day. While social media has brought many benefits, it has also had various negative effects on society. This essay will discuss the effects of social media on today's society.</p><p>One of the most significant effects of social media is the impact it has on mental health. Social media can be addictive, and people who spend excessive amounts of time on social media may experience symptoms such as anxiety and depression. Social media can also contribute to negative body image and low self-esteem, as people are constantly exposed to images of unrealistic beauty standards.</p><p>Social media has also had a significant impact on communication. While social media has made it easier for people to connect with each other, it has also led to a decline in face-to-face communication. Many people now prefer to communicate through social media rather than in person, which can lead to a lack of intimacy and emotional connection.</p><p>Another effect of social media is the spread of misinformation. Social media platforms are often used to spread false information and propaganda, which can have serious consequences, such as inciting violence or causing people to make ill-informed decisions.</p><p>Social media has also had a profound impact on politics. Social media platforms have been used to mobilize and organize protests, as well as spread disinformation during elections. Social media has also been used to spread hate speech and extremist ideologies, which can be dangerous and divisive.</p><p>In conclusion, social media has had a significant impact on today's society. While social media has brought many benefits, such as facilitating communication and enabling people to connect with each other, it has also had negative effects, such as contributing to mental health problems, spreading misinformation, and impacting politics. As social media continues to evolve, it is essential that we remain aware of its potential negative effects and take steps to mitigate them.</p><p></p><p><strong>H</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>P</strong><strong>E</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>P</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>.</strong></p><br />

                        <p>Social media has become an integral part of the daily lives of many students. While some believe that social media has positive effects on students' lives, others argue that the negative effects far outweigh the positive ones. In this essay, I will explore both the positive and negative impacts of social media on students' lives.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, proponents of social media claim that it has numerous benefits for students. Social media allows students to connect with their peers from around the world and share ideas, information, and experiences. Through social media, students can join online communities, participate in group discussions, and collaborate on projects. This leads to increased creativity, innovation, and critical thinking skills. Additionally, social media can help students to stay informed about current events and to develop a better understanding of the world around them.</p><p></p><p>However, opponents of social media argue that it has many negative effects on students' lives. One of the most significant negative impacts of social media is addiction. Many students spend hours scrolling through their social media feeds, leading to procrastination and decreased productivity. Social media can also have negative effects on mental health, causing anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. Furthermore, social media can lead to cyberbullying, harassment, and the spread of false information.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, social media has both positive and negative impacts on students' lives. While it can be a useful tool for connecting with peers, sharing ideas, and staying informed, it can also lead to addiction, mental health issues, cyberbullying, and the spread of false information. It is important for students to use social media responsibly and to be aware of its potential risks and benefits.</p><br />

Both have positive and negative effects on the social lives and mental health of young people. On one hand, television has been around for decades and has provided educational programs, entertainment, and news to viewers. However, it also promotes unrealistic beauty standards and can cause addiction and disconnection from reality. On the other hand, social media has revolutionized the way young people communicate and access information. It has given them a platform to express their thoughts and connect with others. However, it also increases the risk of cyberbullying, mental health issues, and addiction.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A gerund is a verbal. Before defining gerund, you should know first what a verbal is.
</p><p>
</p><p>A verbal is basically a verb, but it does not function as a verb in a sentence. A verbal may act as a noun, adjective or adverb in a sentence.
</p><p>The three types of verbals are gerunds, participles and infinitives.
</p><p>Meanwhile, a gerund is a verbal that acts as a noun in a sentence. It may be formed by using the base form of the verb + ing.
</p><p>
</p><p>For example: work + ing = working
</p><p>
</p><p>A participle is a verbal that acts as an adjective in a sentence. The two types of participles are the present and the past participle.
</p><p>
</p><p>Present participle ends up in -ing like burning, chilling, thrilling
</p><p>Past participles may end in -ed if it is a regular verb like cooked and grilled. Irregular verbs may have different ending letters or different spellings like broken, fallen, burnt.
</p><p>Interacting with people via social media is one of the habits of people nowadays. Their days would not be complete without social media. Some may feel bored when they are out of their social media accounts. Using social media may have advantages and disadvantages to the young people of this generation.
</p><p>
</p><p>Social media connects two people together. Social media accounts help people to stay connected whenever and wherever they go. Social media accounts let young people communicate with their loved ones especially if they are working overseas.
</p><p>
</p><p>In addition, social media helps young people to express themselves virtually. Expressing one's self is difficult for quiet and shy people. They tend to be embarrassed when they express themselves personally. Posting in their social media accounts help them to be inspired and do more for themselves.
</p><p>
</p><p>In contrast, social media is also an avenue for cyber bullying and may get young people to feel ashamed and terrified of themselves. Bullying someone online may lead to different problems. Ranting and posting hate speech online ruin one's self esteem and may usually lead to depression.
</p><p>
</p><p>Using social media accounts is inevitable in this generation. Young ones must learn to use it responsibly.
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In the contemporary world, most people use social media for news, entertainment, to seek information and to be updated every day. Nowadays, the use of social media has greatly changed how people interact with other people. Today, most people only consider the benefits that the social media brought to the people without thinking about the possible negative implications of using it. </p><p></p><p>Youth today are very inclined in using social media. Most of the students tend to believe that social media helps them a lot in terms of learning, studying, researching and finding information. Students can be easily influenced. Due to their curiosity, they want to explore or try what is new and trending to be able to fit into the society. They are able to easily adapt everything that they see around them. With the benefits of social media, it plays a big part in the students’ everyday lives. In using this, it allows people to be updated every day with regards to what is happening in their surroundings. Most of the students use social media for academic purposes, for instance, to be able to interact or communicate with their classmates and teachers with regards to the activities and tasks that have given to them. </p><br />
