Trade also became part of the tourism as Arabs, Indians, Japanese, Chinese, Malays, and other ethnic groups in mainland Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and Ryukyu traded goods with the natives. When the islands became part of the territory of Spain, an influx of Spanish people migrated into the country, though still few compared to the Spanish migrations in South America as the Philippines was farther from Spain. The Philippines is the third largest English speaking country in the world. It has a rich history combining Asian, European, and American influences. Prior to Spanish colonization in 1521, the Filipinos had a rich culture and were trading with the Chinese and the Japanese, Spain's colonization brought about the construction of Intramuros in 1571, a Walled City comprised of European buildings and churches, replicated in different parts of the archipelago. In 1898. after 350 years and 300 rebellions, the Filipinos, with leaders like Jose Rizal and Emilio Aguinaldo, succeeded in winning their independence.​</a>

Be guided by the scoring rubric below. For centuries, Philippines has become popular for its prolific writers when it comes to literary undertakings. Although Philippine literature at the turn of the 21st century is considered to have a brief history; however, most of its writers have already left significant marks in the minds and hearts of its readers through their writings. According to Uychoco (2016), Jose Rizal's undying Noli Me Tangere, casts a long shadow on Philippine literature, today's literary scene is quite different from what it was in the past. English as Second Language teachers still introduce this masterpiece to today's learners as it has emerged not only flexible but innovative literature that has been appreciated and used in various literary learning and even educational debates about language. Literary appreciation is a way of expressing and communicating one's thoughts and ideas about the texts read. It is not just about reading and appreciating them, it is also about understanding their contexts. Through this, both teachers and learners will have a better and wider mental grasp of what they read. It is how we interpret what we read that help us gain a general knowledge of our history and strengthen even our very own personal reflection on our present situation. Philippine literature helps our Filipino learners catch a glimpse of our culture and heritage: that is to say, whatever literary genre we read moves us, triggers our wild imagination, provokes our sense of curiosity, and stirs our thoughts and feelings, upon our own common experience of our present situations.

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

                                            DIRECTIONS: Read the paragraph carefully, observing context clues. Then, answer the questions which follow.1. Valenzuela City People's Park is an urban park located in a 1.3 hectare lot beside the city hall in Barangay Karuhatan. An electronically controlled dancing fountain is an awesome, Instagramable sight at the park entrance. It prides of its 400-seater amphitheater, venue for a wide range of cultural activities. Other amenities include an aero-circle (for Zumba and other group exercises), relaxing garden, children's playground, zoological corner, giant chess, elegant gazebo, seniors corner, and most of all sufficient and well-maintained restrooms. Which among the following statement does not support the above paragraph? ChooseThe People's Park has complete amenities for Valenzuelanos to spend their leisure time.School and community activities has a cultural stage for public viewing in the park.It has limited space and does not have state of the art attractions of modern parks other cities have.The Park reflects social awareness on the importance of nature and fun activities with the family.2. Based on the facts shared in those passages about the City's history and current LGU's performance and continued country wide recognition, an appreciative Valenzuela City resident normal response must be the following, less one which is: ChoosePromote the welfare of the City by being adherent to its call for responsible community living.Protect and conserve its historical and natural landmarks, as well as areas which are natural habitat for wildlife, like the endangered fowls/birds- bakaw-gabi.Promote and patronize the services and products made in Valenzuela.Draw graffiti on the walls of public places and destroy government properties where no CCTV's are installed.3. True to its best practices as a constant recipient of Galing Pook, a search for top ten Local Government Units (LGUs) in the country, Valenzuela City is keen in creating greener spaces.

The park which lies on the historical old town square of Polo, is adorned with hundred-year-old luscious trees, fountain, memorial marker commemorating war veterans and statues of Pio Valenzuela and Jose Rizal. The park signifies not only a place for relaxation but also marks the historical identity of the city. Creating greener spaces in sentence 1 means: ChooseHaving a unified green color paints on fences along city roadsSupporting local artists' graffiti art on public wallsPlanting and growing trees on city parks and officesCultivating garden vegetable4.

                                            An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</a>

If Spain were to see us less tolerant of tyranny and readier to fight and suffer for our rights, Spain would be the first to give us freedom… But as long as the Filipino people do not have sufficient vigor to proclaim, head held high and chest bared, their right to a life of their own in human society, and to guarantee it with their sacrifices, with their very blood…why give them independence? With or without Spain they would be the same, and perhaps, perhaps worse. What is the use of independence if the slaves of today will be the tyrants of tomorrow? And no doubt they will, because whoever submits to tyranny loves it!"     —Dr. Jose Rizal​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The first thing I noticed in Dr. Jose Rizal’s life was that he lived a simple one. He did not choose to have a luxurious life like the most of us have wanted. Even before he became under surveillance by the Spaniards, he had lived his life as simple as possible. I think it was the work of his parents that made him lived like this. I strongly believe that one’s lifestyle is influenced mostly by their parents. I learned from the life of Rizal the importance of taking part of the parents to their children’s morals.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>“My Last Farewell” ( reflection)</p><p>Fighting for our country ieblike fighting for what we love. Fighting for our country is fighting for the freedom of ourselves, family, friends, and love ones. We consider Dr. Jose Rizal as our national hero because he showed us that its not about fighting using a sword or anything that can hurt others. A pen can also seek freedom. In this poem he shows that after the hardships and sacrifices  we will meet the freedom.   </p><p>  </p><p> Being a hero is not having a power like being invisible,lightning etc. A hero is a person who fights for his/her family, friends and love ones. Yes, Dr. Jose Rizal is a hero because using hus intellegence and artistry, he shows other that Filipino’s are capableof being free. He fights for our freedom. He fights  for our rights . He fights for our life. He fight for all of us. He sacrificed everything even his life. That is a Filipino,we will do anything, everything for what it takes. We are all hero’es because like Dr. Jose Rizal we will do everything for our love ones.
</p><p>              </p><p>The lesson I get in the poem is that we are all born as heroes. Not literally a hero that have super powers. But we are hero’es  in our own way. We should treasure every moment in our life. We should treasure allthe people who love us and the people we love.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

For centuries, Philippines has become popular for its prolific writers when it comes to literary undertakings. Although Philippine literature at the turn of the 21st century is considered to have a brief history; however, most of its writers have already left significant marks in the minds and hearts of its readers through their writings. According to Uychoco (2016), Jose Rizal's undying Noli Me Tangere, casts a long shadow on Philippine literature, today's literary scene is quite different from what it was in the past. English as Second Language teachers still introduce this masterpiece to today's learners as it has emerged not only flexible but innovative literature that has been appreciated and used in various literary learning and even educational debates about language. Literary appreciation is a way of expressing and communicating one's thoughts and ideas about the texts read. It is not just about reading and appreciating them, it is also about understanding their contexts. Through this, both teachers and learners will have a better and wider mental grasp of what they read. It is how we interpret what we read that help us gain a general knowledge of our history and strengthen even our very own personal reflection on our present situation. Philippine literature helps our Filipino learners catch a glimpse of our culture and heritage: that is to say, whatever literary genre we read moves us, triggers our wild imagination, provokes our sense of curiosity, and stirs our thoughts and feelings, upon our own common experience of our present situations.

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

Valenzuela City People's Park is an urban park located in a 1.3 hectare lot beside the city hall in Barangay Karuhatan. An electronically controlled dancing fountain is an awesome, Instagramable sight at the park entrance. It prides of its 400-seater amphitheater, venue for a wide range of cultural activities.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The life of Jose Rizal was a truly inspiring story. Not just as an ordinary story of a Filipino but a story of a very intelligent and talented Filipino, who is ready to sacrifice his whole life just to give freedom and peace to his family, and own nation.</p><p></p><p>For one semester, I’ve known who really Rizal is. It might not all about him, but those learning’s and knowledge I learned, is enough to say to myself and to other Filipino and even not, that he deserves to be what he have known for today. And that is, the National Hero of the Filipino. His life was truly amazing and colorful for the hero’s experiences mold him to what God purposely do to him.</p><p></p><p>Jose Rizal, for my own insights, tells me the value of certain things which is important for the success of his life. That is God, Family, Country and Self. He could not reach as that far without God. The Lords is the most important one who could determine our success, just like as Rizal feared God and in return, he have been bless abundantly not by material things only  but a spiritual one. That is intelligence, skills, love, and compassion. Also the role of family is next important for Rizal had been blessed with a family who could guide him to what he really aims. Even nowadays, family is one of the foundations of a person’s character. Next one is country! For Rizal’s portray the love of the country as a means of loving his fellow Filipino, thus helping them to attain justice from the evil and corrupt priest and Spaniards who are mistreating them in their own land for God has created us to extend our help with our fellow as a symbol of glorifying Him. And last is Self. I have learned from Rizal’s life that you should make yourself fruitfully. He makes himself grow to wisdom and knowledge to use it in God’s purpose. He did not say to himself that he is not worth enough and live blind for what is happening in his environment. Thus, he is knows that he is a child of God.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Rizal proved that pen is mightier than a sword. For his expertise in writings enable him to convince his whole fellowmen to attain justice, thus destroying an empire. For words flies wherever and ignites every man’s feelings. Just like as a saying says that word is powerful, there comes positive and negative in it. It could heal one’s heart but also harm another like a double edged sword. Rizal have a God fearing heart so that he have ignite change and peace and thus mean we Filipinos should have a good conscience and God fearing heart to impose positive changes.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to Rizal for he is inspires me and thanks to our professor who imparts and explains all this knowledge for us to better understands it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>T</strong><strong>H</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>S</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>S</strong><strong> </strong><strong>A</strong><strong> </strong><strong>R</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong> </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>U</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>J</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>E</strong><strong> </strong><strong>R</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>Z</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>L</strong><strong> </strong><strong>L</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>E</strong><strong> </strong><strong>[</strong><strong>▪</strong><strong>_</strong><strong>▪</strong><strong>]</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>"The Ultimo Adios" or "The Last Farewell" is a poem written by Philippine National Hero, Dr. Jose Rizal. It was his final goodbye to his motherland and the people he loved.</p><p></p><p>As I reflect on the poem, I deeply admire Rizal's undying love for his country, even at the hour of his death. The poem showcases his patriotism, bravery, and his selfless devotion to his beloved country, the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>In reading the stanza, "Pagkabalisang mahapò ng katawán, / Pagkatapus ng lahát ng kahirapan, / Ako'y maghihintay sa iyó sa kalangitan," it is truly moving to think that even in his final moments, Rizal's love for his country remains steadfast. He is willing to accept his fate and ready to leave the earthly things behind, and entrusts the future of his homeland to his fellow countrymen.</p><p></p><p>The poem inspires and reminds us that the struggle for freedom is not an easy path. It is a journey of sacrifice, bravery, and unwavering determination. Rizal's ultimate sacrifice, his own life, serves as a challenge to every Filipino to continue the fight for the honor and the betterment of our country.</p><p></p><p>Rizal's patriotism and strong conviction for freedom will always serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration to our nation. As we remember him and his contribution to our country's history, it is an opportunity to renew our commitment to the ideals he fought for, and to strive for a better and brighter future for our beloved country.</p><p></p><br />

                            21. An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Jose Rizal, having completed his Bachiller en Artes at the Ateneo Municipal, was now eligible for higher education at a university. His mother, Doña Teodora, had second thoughts about sending her son to school because of the previous incident involving the execution of friars Gomez, Burgos and Zamora.

                            25. Write a brief reflection/reaction about the paragraph below:"Our misfortunes are our own fault, let us blame nobody else for them. If Spain were to see us less tolerant of tyranny and readier to fight and suffer for our rights, Spain would be the first to give us freedom… But as long as the Filipino people do not have sufficient vigor to proclaim, head held high and chest bared, their right to a life of their own in human society, and to guarantee it with their sacrifices, with their very blood…why give them independence? With or without Spain they would be the same, and perhaps, perhaps worse. What is the use of independence if the slaves of today will be the tyrants of tomorrow? And no doubt they will, because whoever submits to tyranny loves it!"     —Dr. Jose Rizal​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This paragraph expresses Dr. Jose Rizal's belief that the Filipino people need to take responsibility for their own misfortune and actively fight for their rights. He argues that unless they display courage and determination, they do not deserve independence from Spain. He also warns that without a change in mindset, the people will become tyrants themselves. This reflection highlights the importance of agency and personal responsibility in creating a better future.</p><p>sa bunod ka Mona kasmaa</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sa bahay nila char diko alam</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Dr. Jose Rizal's second homecoming</strong> can be read in Life, Works, and Accomplishments of Jose Rizal. It is under <strong>chapter 21</strong> entitled "Jose Rizal's Second Homecoming and La Liga Filipina".</p><p></p><p>Here is a 4-paragraph reflection paper about <strong>Dr. Jose Rizal's 2nd homecoming.</strong> It also includes his plans, projects, and socio-political actions.​</p><p></p>                  The Second Homecoming<p></p><p>             <strong>Rizal </strong>wanted to personally talk to <strong>Despujol </strong>concerning his <strong>Borneo colonization project.</strong> He was in Hong Kong at that time but he left the country on June 21, 1892, along with his sister Lucia. I felt really proud of his action because of his initiatives to give the landless Filipinos to at least settle in north Borneo. I wish he was not steadfast in his decision because he had no idea that a secret case had been filed against him for the <strong>anti-religious and anti-patriotic campaign</strong>.</p><p></p><p>             Rizal and Lucia arrived in Manila at noon on <strong>June 26, 1892</strong>, and on the same day, at 7:00 PM, he was able to talk with Despujol who agreed to pardon his father. Rizal was also told that he should return on the 29th of June. On the evening of July 3rd, <strong>Rizal lead a meeting in Tondo, Manila</strong> which was attended by more than 20 Filipinos including <strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong> and <strong>Apolinario Mabini</strong>. I was so amazed by how Rizal was able to convince fellow Filipino heroes and spearhead a conference for the country.</p><p></p><p>             They discussed the <strong>La Liga Filipina</strong> and Rizal thoroughly discussed the aims of this association. They even elected officers with Ambrosio Salvador as the president. In my opinion, they are slowly getting into awakening their <strong>patriotism </strong>and love for the country. If they were not able to hold the said meeting, everything will be worthless because three days after, <strong>they sabotaged Rizal</strong> and Despujol's meeting causing <strong>Rizal's imprisonment in Fort Santiago.</strong></p><p></p><p>             I was so glad about the outcome of how <strong>Rizal planned everything</strong> even if the end of his life was really tragic. We could not have the freedom we are enjoying right now if not because of his brilliant mindset and the cooperation of his fellow Filipino heroes. <strong>I am so proud of our national</strong> hero and it only proves that you do not always need physical means to win in battles.</p><p>                                                    -end-</p><p></p><p>If you want to learn more about the life and works of Rizal, please head over to this link directly:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/6934237</p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />
