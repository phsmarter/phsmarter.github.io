                        answer:Concept essays provide a chance to explore ideas you might previously have taken for granted. Writing a concept essay requires careful exploration of a concept, a concise and interesting thesis and a strong overall structure. Before you begin to write, it may be helpful to engage in some prewriting. Word webs, outlines and free writing can help you uncover insights about a topic you might not realize at first. After prewriting, develop a working thesis, an interesting introduction, body paragraphs and a conclusion.<p>Thesis</p><p>Your working thesis should define a concept you will develop throughout the essay. Allow your working thesis to change as you explore the concept instead of trying to build an essay around a definition that you no longer believe. Though a bit persuasive by nature, a concept essay thesis should not be an argument. Instead, a concept essay thesis should provide one well-reasoned definition among many, because the meaning of a concept can be difficult, if not impossible, to define through objective reasoning. A clear definition of a concept also can allow you to explore it in various contexts, whereas a vague definition might leave you unsure of why the concept matters. Finalize your thesis once most of the paper has been written</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Strong introductions should show why a concept matters in real life and how your essay will explore the connection between the concept and human experiences. If the concept is “success,” an introduction might provide an anecdote in which success was an important part of your life or some world event, such as the Olympics. Narrative introductions often work for positive concepts such as “happiness,” while more objective introductions work best for somber concepts such as “war.”</p><p>Body</p><p>Develop body paragraphs that explore important aspects of the concept. Because concepts often are more complex than short college essays can fully account for, choose the most illuminating aspects or those with the most relevance to you and your audience. For example, if the concept of an essay is “success,” body paragraphs might discuss the differences between professional, cultural and personal success. Use a strong topic sentence to indicate the purpose of each body paragraph, and connect all of your body paragraphs to expand your definition of the concept.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One function of education is to promote socialization, which refers to the process of learning social norms, values, beliefs, and behaviors necessary for individuals to function effectively in society. Through socialization, individuals learn to interact with others, develop a sense of identity, and acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to participate in social institutions.</p><p></p><p>An example of socialization in education is the school system. In school, students learn to interact with their peers and teachers, follow rules and procedures, and develop a sense of responsibility and accountability. They also learn about the values and beliefs of their society, such as honesty, respect, and cooperation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, socialization through education helps individuals develop critical thinking skills and the ability to make informed decisions. By learning about different perspectives and viewpoints, individuals can understand and appreciate diversity, which is crucial in today's globalized world.</p><p></p><p>In summary, the function of education in promoting socialization is important in shaping individuals' personal and social development. It helps them to become productive members of society and prepares them to face the challenges of the future.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The Function of Education</p><p></p><p>Today, educators seek to promulgate values through education. A. Phillip Randolph, civil rights leader and co-founder of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, once said that " educ" is "the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world." In their seminal work, Out of Our Minds: Education and the Evolution of Human Reason, Jerome Bruner and Jean Piaget argued that education facilitates the cognitive development of humans. In other words, it helps individuals to develop their cognitive abilities and understanding, including the ability to reason, think abstractly, and plan for the future.</p><p></p><p>Education is thus seen as a tool to help individuals grow and develop into contributing members of society. It instills in them a sense of right and wrong, and sets them up for future success. It teaches them how to think critically, solve problems, and think for themselves. It helps them to be productive citizens, to be advocates for their beliefs, and to take responsibility for their own lives.</p><p></p><p>In today's society, it is more important than ever for individuals to have strong foundations in both academic and non-academic areas. Many today are facing an ever-growing global market, and they need to be able to think critically and solve problems. In a world where knowledge is power, education is the key to unlocking that power.</p><p></p><br />

"Survival of the fittest" is a popular term that refers to the process of natural selection, a mechanism that drives evolutionary change. Natural selection works by giving individuals who are better adapted to a given set of environmental conditions an advantage over those that are not as well adapted. Survival of the fittest refers to the fact that the 'fittest' can survive in any environment, regardless of their complexity.

                            19. Write a short essay about what you think happens on Earth based on the concept "The lithospheric movement leads to the tectonic activities that shape the geological features of the Earth." What real-life example can you give about this?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Earth's lithosphere is a cracked planetary shell floating on a dense, liquid mantle. These cracks are that fault lines that we have today and the pieces of the shell are what we call tectonic plates. There are two major factors that results to the movement of the lithosphere: The instability of the mantle as materials of different density are interacting with each other, and the difference in density of the tectonic plates. As the mantle below moves, <strong>plates above are also forced to move along with it, causing earthquakes</strong>.</p><p>The case of differential density between tectonic plates is illustrated by the <strong>formation of the Himalayas mountain range</strong> and why the highest peaks on the planet, including Mt Everest, are located in the area. As the instability of the mantle below drives the denser Indo-Australian plate against the relatively lighter Eurasian plate. This results to the buckling of both plates, with the  Indo-Australian plate going under and pushing the Eurasian plate upwards, resulting growth of Himalayas at more than 1cm per year. This collision not only produce the beautiful Himalayas, but it also responsible for the creation of the Tibetan plateau and consequently  contributed to the desertification of the Taklamakan desert, while the rising moisture from the Indian ocean along the ridge of the Himalayas contributes to the formation of monsoons.</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><br />
