                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Yes, I've experienced being sick when I was a kid, about 3 or 4 years of age. I was admitted at a hospital in a nearby city, since I'm living in a province area. I've been provided with enough care and attention from health care workers and doctors whom they've treated me for almost a year because of my health problem.</p><p></p><p>2. I think I did, especially with online shopping. I once bought a tablet cover but I forgot if it's Lazada or Shopee, but anyhow, it made me disappointed that my package was actually not looking good. It happened that the support for the stand seems to have teared out while the color of the cover was faded, and I paid for it expensively. I wanted to report about this case but nevertheless I thought about not making any issues especially with a lot of problems going on so I just let it slide. I decided to redecorate the cover myself.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Additional Activities
Directions: Read the conversation below where the remark by an employer could be
misinterpreted by an employee of a company. Write a ten-to-fifteen-sentence essay
explaining where the confusion could have originated. Why do you think the
employee misinterpreted the employer? What then is the importance of
understanding speech acts.
Employer: Are you doing anything?
Employee: I'm sorry. I will do something now.
Employer: No. what I mean is if you are not doing anything, then you
can go home and take a rest now. You have been working
too hard.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The employee must have thought that the employer was saying it in a mean way or bad way. Which explains why the employee responded that way. The employee seems to be scared to get fired of course. Who wouldn't be? However, the employee looks hardwoking. It was sweet when the Employer told him to just go home and rest. The employer probably observing him doing works the whole day that's why he told him that. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>kulang sa sentence medyo barado itak ko ngayondagdagan mo nalang,,, You're welcome </p><br />

In fact, hot springs are such a fad in the Philippines that a lot of tourists, both local and foreign, go out of their way to visit them. How would you describe a hot spring? Can you name places where there are hot springs present? What do these areas have in common?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Have you ever been to a hot spring?No, not yet.<p></p><strong>How would you describe a hot spring?</strong>Hot spring, also called thermal spring, spring with water at temperatures substantially higher than the air temperature of the surrounding region. Most hot springs discharge groundwater that is heated by shallow intrusions of magma (molten rock) in volcanic areas.<p></p><strong>Can you name places where there are hot springs present?</strong>Countries that are renowned for their hot springs include Turkey, Honduras, Canada, Chile, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand, India, Romania, Fiji, and the United States, but there are interesting and unique hot springs in many other places as well.<p></p>What do these areas have in common?These are all volcanic areas. Hot springs are generally found in regions of recent volcanic activity. It is because the surface water percolates downward through the rocks below the Earth's surface into high-temperature regions surrounding a magma reservoir, either active or recently solidified but still hot.<br />

                            30. Your supervisor has asked you to organize a vacation for your colleagues. A set amount has been allocated for this purpose.  You have shortlisted two destinations: Fancy Land and Heaven Island. How would you decide where to go?</h2><br />
                        <p>I would consider the following before deciding where to go on a vacation with my colleagues. First, the length of our vacation. Most employees work from Monday to Friday, so the vacation granted with the colleagues would probably be only applied on a weekend, could be overnight. Second, the distance of the place from us. Time travel should also be considered if only given limited days of vacation. Lastly, it is proper to ask my colleagues what they would also prefer. Since I already have two choices, I’d give them some ideas about each place and what activities we could do, as well as the accommodation and food we may experience. </p><br /><p>Based on the shortlisted destinations, personally, I think I would prefer the Fancy Land. Because, when we say fancy, it sounds decorated and structured. The place could be very attractive to visitors. With the day(s) allotted to the vacationers, I think Fancy Land would be more manageable. However, on the other hand, Heaven Island sounds like a very convincing place to relax and unwind, far from the hustle and bustle of the city. In this case, you really need to have a longer days of vacation, unless approved by your supervisor, then this will be chosen.</p><br />
