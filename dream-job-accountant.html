This has been my signature line every time I wasasked if I wanted to be like my mother I did not like to be a teacher because eversince I was a kid, I already admired the broadcasting profession. In fact, I dreamed ofbecoming a news anchor - someone that could be seen on the television worldwide.Someone like Korina Sanchez to be exact. Perhaps, this could be attributed to myearly exposure to public speaking since I was used to holding a microphone during myalementary days. I was exposed in host ng simple programs at school and was givenopportunities in participating various oral contests.But everything changed when I was in high school. I came to realize that Iwanted to become an accountant. Yes, I was amazed with the thought of working in abank. I would love to work in a cozy environment and fully airconditioned room and tovear stunning uniform For four years, I had been the desire of my heart. Not until Iwas about to enroll in college.To my surprise, I changed my course in just a snap of a finger. Why? Simplybecause computer related courses were the most in demand during that time. Withouta second thought, I chose BS Computer Science instead of BS Accountancy. I soothedimyself with the end in mind of working at least in an office after graduationTime flew fast, I finally graduated from college. After graduation, I startedlooking for a job. And every time I saw my mother, who was a high school teacher,kept on telling myself that I was very fortunate for I was not a teacher. Still, I did notwant to be like her. Until one day, after several months of job hunting, I was finallyhired! To my biggest surprise, I was employed as a high school computer TEACHER.never imagined teaching for I know how difficult it was but now, I realized howmuch joy teaching has given me. For a mother like me, I see teaching similar toparenting Raising a learner is like raising your own child. Truly, to teach is to touchives Like Henry Adams, I believe that a teacher affects eternity, and no one knowswhere his/her influence stops. Indeed, it is from NEVER to FOREVER ​</a>

Emotional Intelligence  Are you a person who graduated with honors yet cannot keep or advance in a job? Are you a person with a dream of becoming an entrepreneur but lacks the courage to pursue a project that is clearly within your area of expertise? If you are, then you are wanting in emotional intelligence - abilities involving emotional discipline and control. It involves the abilities to motivate oneself and persist in the face of frustration; to control one's impulse and delay gratification; to regulate one's moods; and to keep distress from swamping the ability to think, to empathize, and to hope. While IQ has its nearly one-hundred-year history of research on hundreds of thousands of people, emotional intelligence is a new concept. No one can yet say exactly how much of the variability from person to person in life's course it accounts for. But data suggest that EQ can be as powerful as IQ and at times, more powerful in shaping the destiny of man. While there are those who agree that IQ cannot be changed much by experience or education, these crucial emotional competencies can indeed be learned - if we bother to teach them. </a>

This has been my signature line every time I wasasked if I wanted to be like my mother I did not like to be a teacher because eversince I was a kid, I already admired the broadcasting profession. In fact, I dreamed ofbecoming a news anchor - someone that could be seen on the television worldwide.Someone like Korina Sanchez to be exact. Perhaps, this could be attributed to myearly exposure to public speaking since I was used to holding a microphone during myalementary days. I was exposed in host ng simple programs at school and was givenopportunities in participating various oral contests.But everything changed when I was in high school. I came to realize that Iwanted to become an accountant. Yes, I was amazed with the thought of working in abank. I would love to work in a cozy environment and fully airconditioned room and tovear stunning uniform For four years, I had been the desire of my heart. Not until Iwas about to enroll in college.To my surprise, I changed my course in just a snap of a finger. Why? Simplybecause computer related courses were the most in demand during that time. Withouta second thought, I chose BS Computer Science instead of BS Accountancy. I soothedimyself with the end in mind of working at least in an office after graduationTime flew fast, I finally graduated from college. After graduation, I startedlooking for a job. And every time I saw my mother, who was a high school teacher,kept on telling myself that I was very fortunate for I was not a teacher. Still, I did notwant to be like her. Until one day, after several months of job hunting, I was finallyhired! To my biggest surprise, I was employed as a high school computer TEACHER.never imagined teaching for I know how difficult it was but now, I realized howmuch joy teaching has given me. For a mother like me, I see teaching similar toparenting Raising a learner is like raising your own child.

Emotional Intelligence  Are you a person who graduated with honors yet cannot keep or advance in a job? Are you a person with a dream of becoming an entrepreneur but lacks the courage to pursue a project that is clearly within your area of expertise? If you are, then you are wanting in emotional intelligence - abilities involving emotional discipline and control. It involves the abilities to motivate oneself and persist in the face of frustration; to control one's impulse and delay gratification; to regulate one's moods; and to keep distress from swamping the ability to think, to empathize, and to hope. While IQ has its nearly one-hundred-year history of research on hundreds of thousands of people, emotional intelligence is a new concept. No one can yet say exactly how much of the variability from person to person in life's course it accounts for. But data suggest that EQ can be as powerful as IQ and at times, more powerful in shaping the destiny of man. While there are those who agree that IQ cannot be changed much by experience or education, these crucial emotional competencies can indeed be learned - if we bother to teach them. </h2><br />

What would be your financial situation in 5 years?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: Reasons why saving money is important</strong></p><p><strong>Savings is crucial for everyone, regardless of their earnings, spending and life stage. Here are some reasons why you need to start saving.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>It offers peace of mind: Knowing that you have a certain amount accumulated for times of your need, gives you peace of mind. You can lead a stress-free life with the knowledge that you will not have to struggle if things take an unexpected route.</strong></p><p><strong>It gives you a better future: Your savings can be the answer to a number of your goals. You can buy a house, accumulate funds for your retirement, or purchase a vehicle. You can secure your future, indulge in the best of things that life has to offer and live a very fulfiling life.</strong></p><p><strong>It provides for your children’s education: With a considerable amount of savings, you can fuel your children’s dreams and pay for the best schools and colleges across the world.</strong></p><p><strong>You can plan your short-term goals: Savings are not just aimed at the long term. You can also benefit from savings in the short term. A lot of people save for a few months and then travel.</strong></p><p><strong>It gives your family security in case of an unfortunate event: By saving in a disciplined manner, you can make sure that your family is well-provided for. In unfortunate times, your savings can act as a cushion for your loved ones and help them overcome any financial difficulty.</strong></p><p><strong>$T&amp;Cs apply</strong></p><p><strong>Tips to enable savings</strong></p><p><strong>If you are new to savings or find it difficult to stick to your objective of saving, then you can try the following steps.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Limit your credit card usage: Credit cards may provide a temporary sense of relief, but the high rates of interest can deplete your savings in no time. It helps to limit your debt and restrict credit card purchases to ensure that your savings are intact and growing.</strong></p><p><strong>Keep a track of your expenses: If you find it difficult to save regularly, try to record and keep a track of your monthly expenditure. This will offer you a clear picture of where you spend. You can then identify the things that are not important and aim at saving more by avoiding those purchases.</strong></p><p><strong>Create a budget for savings: It helps to devise a budget for each month. You can create a plan at the beginning of the month to target savings and set limits for spending. This lets you focus on what is important, reduces the chances of over-spending, and lets you save as planned.</strong></p><p><strong>Invest in long-term financial tools: When you save, it is also important to see your savings grow with time. Investing your money in a long-term investment plan can have many additional benefits. These plans offer a lucrative rate of interest that lets your money retain its value and beat inflation. One such instrument is the savings or endowment plan. The ICICI Pru Assured Savings Insurance Plan is a new age endowment plan that is designed to address your life insurance needs.</strong></p><p></p><br />
