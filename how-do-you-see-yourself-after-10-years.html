                                            The Discontented Pendulum
FACE: Okay, tell me. . . who among did it?
WHEELS AND WEIGHTS [Aloud]: Surely not we!
HANDS: Don’t look at us. It’s not we either.
PENDULUM [Sheepishly]: I did it! The truth is. . . I’m tired of tick-tocking and swaying for
fifty years. I give up!
FACE [Angrily]: You lazy thing! How could you!
PENDULUM: It is easy for you, Lady Face, to set yourself above me and accuse me of laziness.
You do nothing but look pretty and stare at people and watch all that go in and on in the kitchen.
How would you like to be in the dark closet and do nothing but wag back and forth year after
year like I do? I’m tired of my life. After thinking it over last night, I figured out how many
times in a month do I have to tick while the Hour Hand just goes around once. Do you have
any idea how many times that is?
MINUTE HAND [Brightly speaking up]: Forty-three thousand two hundred times!
PENDULUM: Right! And in one week, how many times must I wag?
MINUTE HAND [Thinking]: Ten thousand eighty.
PENDULUM: Exactly! And in one year?
3
MINUTE HAND [Thinking harder]:. .Er-r-r. Let me think.
HOUR HAND: Take your time, dear; you can do it.
MINUTE HAND [Shouting]: Thirty-one million four hundred and forty-nine thousand six
hundred! Half ticks and half ticks. There is silence. Everyone waits for the Pendulum to say
whether the answer is correct or not. And then. .
PENDULUM: Very good, smart fellow! Now, you all see why I’m tired of ticktocking. It’s too
much to ask of anyone. So please count me out.
FACE: Mr. Pendulum, would you mind wagging six times, only six times to please a lady?
PENDULUM: With pleasure! Here. . . tick-tock, tick-tock.
FACE: Thank you, I hope it did not tire you.
PENDULUM: Of course not. Sixty times would not tire me, nor six hundred, nor six thousand,
but when it comes to thirty-one million. . . ugh! That’s too much to ask of anyone.
FACE: It tires you to think about all those wags, but it does not tire you to wag one wag at a
time. Isn’t that true?
PENDULUM: Yes, but thirty-one million!
FACE: You say it in a minute, but you have to do it a whole long year---winter, summer, spring,
and fall. Think about it. Nobody hurries you.
HOUR HAND: Look at it this way. Spring cannot come until you have comfortably tick-tocked
so many million more times.
MINUTE HAND: And the leaves cannot turn red in autumn, and Jack Frost cannot appear
before you give the signal.
FACE: You see. Time is in your hands and so much depends on you. Would you rather let
people down?
PENDULUM [Overjoyed]: That’s so! I’m an important person! [Jumping] Ye-hey! You’re
right! I don’t have to rush. There’s always a year’s tick-tocking. So, all get back to work.
ALL: Yeah, back to work!
With this, the Wheels begin to turn; the Hands begin to move. Lady Face smiles brightly and
the Pendulum proudly sways back and forth---tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock---as if nothing
Happened.

                        Answer:<br /><br />  In ten years, I can see myself having many of my goal accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goals to fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house, car, kids, and the dog.<br />

                            2. how do you see yourself in the field of teaching after 10 years?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>Schools, whether public or private, always  prefer to hire teachers who plan to stay with them for a long time, or at least for a reasonable time. That’s no secret.Every new employee is an investment–and it takes some time until this investment “pays off”, speaking in a business language. In a teaching language, it takes time until you get to know the ins and outs of a particular school, classes, until you connect with both teachers and students, and basically until you start feeling comfortable in your new role and really deliver. Needless to say, this argument is even more valid if you are fresh from college, and applying for your first teaching job.Hence you should try to convince us that you do not plan to leave the school soon, and a good way of doing that is connecting your future with the educational institution in question. Of course, you can have your own plans and expectations from life. Perhaps you want to start your own school, or you dream of going to Far East and teach English there. I cannot tell…<br />

                        <strong>How do you see yourself 10 years from now? </strong><p></p><p>Like many others, I have a <strong>goal </strong>that I must attain no matter how difficult the circumstances are. Actually, my well-wishers believe that the objectives that I hold dear are unrealistic, thus I need to have a backup plan in the form of <strong>goals</strong>. You know, according to society, unrealistic ambitions or dreams are also necessary since they help you evolve into a better person. They may not be monetarily beneficial, but they are our ideal <strong>goals</strong>. So, like all of my pals, I have a realistic <strong>goal </strong>that can be accomplished via hard work and devotion while still allowing me to partake in all of life's material pleasures.</p><p>My <strong>goal </strong>is to raise awareness about vegetarianism, a healthy lifestyle, and living in a sustainable manner. I am a vegetarian, and I wish to raise public awareness about the advantages of eating this way. Nowadays, keeping vegetarian is difficult because there are so many temptations, such as peer pressure, that draw you in that direction. I'm not suggesting that being a non-vegetarian is terrible, but vegetarian diets, in my opinion, are natural meals that help us reach our aim of keeping healthy. I am also a fan of zero waste and minimal consumption, which I believe is an important aspect of caring for our mother. I'd also like to do something positive for the environment.</p><p></p><p>How do you see yourself 10 years from now? brainly.ph/question/2157417</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />

PENDULUM: Of course not. Sixty times would not tire me, nor six hundred, nor six thousand,
but when it comes to thirty-one million. . . ugh! That’s too much to ask of anyone.
FACE: It tires you to think about all those wags, but it does not tire you to wag one wag at a
time. Isn’t that true?
PENDULUM: Yes, but thirty-one million!
FACE: You say it in a minute, but you have to do it a whole long year---winter, summer, spring,
and fall. Think about it. Nobody hurries you.
HOUR HAND: Look at it this way. Spring cannot come until you have comfortably tick-tocked
so many million more times.
MINUTE HAND: And the leaves cannot turn red in autumn, and Jack Frost cannot appear
before you give the signal.
FACE: You see. Time is in your hands and so much depends on you. Would you rather let
people down?
PENDULUM [Overjoyed]: That’s so! I’m an important person! [Jumping] Ye-hey! You’re
right! I don’t have to rush. There’s always a year’s tick-tocking. So, all get back to work.
ALL: Yeah, back to work!
With this, the Wheels begin to turn; the Hands begin to move. Lady Face smiles brightly and
the Pendulum proudly sways back and forth---tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock---as if nothing
Happened.
