                                            In a Different Time ZoneRegino Costantino F. HerbosaFactors thatAffect theselectionwrittenI'm in the car, in a foreign country, 10,000 miles from home, feeling lost.My delegation and I were the only ones who spoke Filipino. It was really sunnyThursday, 3rd of July, 7:30 in the morning. I looked outside seeing jet planes flyout of Brussels International Airport. The people inside the car, aside from mydelegation, were Simon, an 11 year old kid, Freya, his sister, and their mom, whoonly spoke English the best.In Belguim, French and Dutch languages are spoken. In the Northern partof Belguim, also known as Flanders, people speak Dutch and in the southern part,in the region called Wallonia, they speak French. I thought how amazing it is fortwo totally different languages to be spoken in one country.Being in a different country makes me feel more proud to be Filipino. Thefact that we were sent as delegates from our country made the feeling morespecial. This exciting learning experience allowed me to recall my school trainingof being committed to excellence, competent, and proud Filipino. My goodeducation brought me here, and this is where I would want to serve mycountrymen.I met people of many races. I made friends with Lebanese kids - Husseinand Ramzi and German kids - Johan and Freddy who were really kind. I expectedthem to be really energetic, but they were quiet and shy the whole morning.Meeting people from different regions of the earth is just a rare opportunity that iswhy; I made the first move and befriended them.We were all welcomed by our host families. A host family is a family where youwould stay before your camp for three days. On the final day, campers were in a"Village," the camp as others call it.The first day went really fast. Before I knew it, it was 8:30 in the evening. It didn'tfeel that it was night, because the sun was still up. It's really incredible that a partof the world is still sunny even though it is nighttime already. Before I closed myeyes, 1 silently prayed to God for Him to guide me and my loved ones whom !have left behind in my home country.We had an "Earth Ceremony." In this rite, we had to bring soil from our countryand put it in a basin, and mix it. It represents our unity and our love for our MotherEarth​</a>

As he looked around the countryside, he muttered to himself "What a different place this is! There are neither carriages nor stores. I see nothing but old-looking houses and fields." He was then led into a hut. Sweet corn, peas, barley and small pieces of cheese were placed in front of the guest who was grumbling with disgust. "Please help yourself, though it's not much of a meal," said the country mouse. Taking a bite of barley, the town mouse said to the host mouse, "How can you stand living on such poor food? Why don't you visit me in my town house? I will treat you to a big feast." 1. Who invited the town mouse for dinner? 2. What did the town mouse see in the countryside? 3.

                                            young people out there -- to believe that you can make a difference your wagon to something bigger than yourselves. Let me tell you, this generation coming up unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic - I've seen you in every corner of the country. You believe in a fair, and just, and inclusive America. You know that constant change has been America's hallmark; that it's not something to fear but something to embrace. You are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward. You'll soon outnumber all of us, and I believe as a result the future is in good hands. My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won't stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you're young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President -- the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I'm asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change - but in yours. I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written: Yes, we can. Yes, we did. Yes, we can. Thank you. God bless you. May God continue to bless the United States of America.

I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4. What did the writer mean by putting words into action based on the poems and essays written by our national heroes in the past? 5-6. How can you prove your love for your country in times of war?

Make believe that you are one of the following: (a. teacher b. policeman c. doctor d. businessman) How can you show that you are a true Filipino in terms of solving community and national problems? ​</a>

                            4. In a Different Time ZoneRegino Costantino F. HerbosaFactors thatAffect theselectionwrittenI'm in the car, in a foreign country, 10,000 miles from home, feeling lost.My delegation and I were the only ones who spoke Filipino. It was really sunnyThursday, 3rd of July, 7:30 in the morning. I looked outside seeing jet planes flyout of Brussels International Airport. The people inside the car, aside from mydelegation, were Simon, an 11 year old kid, Freya, his sister, and their mom, whoonly spoke English the best.In Belguim, French and Dutch languages are spoken. In the Northern partof Belguim, also known as Flanders, people speak Dutch and in the southern part,in the region called Wallonia, they speak French. I thought how amazing it is fortwo totally different languages to be spoken in one country.Being in a different country makes me feel more proud to be Filipino. Thefact that we were sent as delegates from our country made the feeling morespecial. This exciting learning experience allowed me to recall my school trainingof being committed to excellence, competent, and proud Filipino. My goodeducation brought me here, and this is where I would want to serve mycountrymen.I met people of many races. I made friends with Lebanese kids - Husseinand Ramzi and German kids - Johan and Freddy who were really kind. I expectedthem to be really energetic, but they were quiet and shy the whole morning.Meeting people from different regions of the earth is just a rare opportunity that iswhy; I made the first move and befriended them.We were all welcomed by our host families. A host family is a family where youwould stay before your camp for three days. On the final day, campers were in a"Village," the camp as others call it.The first day went really fast. Before I knew it, it was 8:30 in the evening. It didn'tfeel that it was night, because the sun was still up. It's really incredible that a partof the world is still sunny even though it is nighttime already. Before I closed myeyes, 1 silently prayed to God for Him to guide me and my loved ones whom !have left behind in my home country.We had an "Earth Ceremony." In this rite, we had to bring soil from our countryand put it in a basin, and mix it. It represents our unity and our love for our MotherEarth​</h2><br />

"Please help yourself, though it's not much of a meal," said the country mouse. Taking a bite of barley, the town mouse said to the host mouse, "How can you stand living on such poor food?

                            15. young people out there -- to believe that you can make a difference your wagon to something bigger than yourselves. Let me tell you, this generation coming up unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic - I've seen you in every corner of the country. You believe in a fair, and just, and inclusive America. You know that constant change has been America's hallmark; that it's not something to fear but something to embrace. You are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward. You'll soon outnumber all of us, and I believe as a result the future is in good hands. My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won't stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you're young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President -- the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I'm asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change - but in yours. I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written: Yes, we can. Yes, we did. Yes, we can. Thank you. God bless you. May God continue to bless the United States of America.

                            20. I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4. What did the writer mean by putting words into action based on the poems and essays written by our national heroes in the past? 5-6. How can you prove your love for your country in times of war?
