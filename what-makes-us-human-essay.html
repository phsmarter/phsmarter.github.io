                                            ParagraphDirections: Read and understand the paragraphs below, then answer the questions thatfollow. Write them on the second column.Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty tolook at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food,fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, morethan half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! Scientists say that if deforestationcontinues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, andanimals will die.One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. If you use lesspaper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answeris to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists orPhone messages and when you write a rought draft of an essay write on back of.AnswerQuestion1.

                                            Instruction: Read the essay "Why Life is Important" and then write the summary. Why is Life Important? One important aspect of Life is that it keeps going forward. This means nothing is permanent. Hence, there should be a reason to stay in dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one. Above all, one must be optimistic no matter how bad things get. This is because nothing will stay forever. Every situation, occasion, and event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life. Many people become very sad because of failures. However, these people certainly fail to see the bright side. The bright side is that there is a reason for every failure. Therefore, every failure teaches us a valuable lesson. This means every failure builds experience. This experience is what improves the skills and efficiency of humans. Probably a huge number of individuals complain that Life is a pain. Many people believe that the word pain is a synonym for Life. However, it is pain that makes us stronger. Pain is certainly an excellent way of increasing mental resilience. Above all, pain enriches the mind. The uncertainty of death is what makes life so precious. No one knows the hour of one's death. This probably is the most important reason to live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic is an utter wastage of Life. One must certainly enjoy the beautiful blessings of Life before death overtakes. a​</a>

Teresa B. Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</a>

                                            C. Open-Ended Questions. Read the essay thoroughly. Then, answer the questions that follow. Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants? Excerpt from an essay written by Kris Gledhill After England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day." Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people. Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method." Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee. So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing. In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included. We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene? Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures." The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal. 1.

   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

Having read all these details about the bill, especially the statement of the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights about the broad definition of the word “terrorism” which caused confusion or worse misunderstanding and disagreement, it is safe to say that certain words can evoke feelings or make people think in a different way.

Paragraph Development
Directions: Write TRUE if the statement is correct; otherwise, replace the underlined word/s to make the statement correct. (15 items x 2 point)
 1. Since the meaning of a word can change through time and the perception of any word can also be interpreted differently by people, it is necessary to put a denotation so that there is an experience-based definition in the essay.
 2. Connotation and extended definition are optional in writing a definition essay because people have different interpretations of words and concepts and including them would only confuse readers.
 3. The process of explaining and giving examples to clarify how the writer understand a concept is called persuasion.
 4. The main purpose of exemplification is to make even more understandable complex ideas, concepts, words, and expressions to your target readers.
 5. Enumerating facts is a technique in exemplification that relies on the individual interpretations of people on certain events, situations, ideas and concepts in supporting your point.
 6. When dealing with a Supportive Audience, pathos is the most effective appeal that you can use.
 7. Specifically in essay writing, comparison cannot be done alone nor contrast because they are complementary to each other.
 8. Personification is a technique in comparison and contrast that assigns the characteristics of non-humans to human to personify the subject.
 9. Causal Analysis can be translated into this diagram:
EFFECTS → SITUATION → CAUSES. Meaning, the author may present the causes towards the effects, or begin with the effects and proceed towards cause.
 10. The effect is what prompted something to happen.
 11. Detailing the process and giving directions are parts of explanatory mode of paragraph development.
 12. Explanation or discussion aims to make the readers understand and explain a particular statement or a theory.
 13. Classification entails categorization, which enables one to group together items according to their similarities.
 14. Exclusiveness, in a paragraph of classification, is characterized by having parallel similarities in the divisions you make in your writing.
 15. Division is a technique in classification wherein the concept or topic is broken down into its essential parts.</a>

                                            Activity 2. Read and analyze the paragraphs below. Then answer the following questions: In many ways, fiction and non-fiction are different from each other. Fiction, which includes novels, short stories, poems and plays, interprets human experience through the presentation of fictitious persons or situations and not through actual truths about particular events or abstract relations between ideas and reality. It presents lifelike images of people and events to embody truths about man and the human condition. On the other hand, nonfiction such as essays and biographies present or interpret facts, experiences, ideas or events, and make us appreciate the strangeness, the humor or the tragedy inherent in or connected with them. It discusses factual information and ideas to satisfy people's need for understanding and cognition. Individualistic and collectivist cultures vary in many ways. Members of an individualistic culture view their primary responsibility as helping themselves, whereas people in collective cultures feel loyalties and obligations to an in-group or one's extended family, community or organization. Individualistic cultures are also characterized by self-reliance and competition while members of a collective culture are more attentive to and concerned with the welfare of significant others. In handling disagreements, individualistic societies are relatively tolerant of conflicts and use a direct, solution - oriented approach. In contrast, members of collective cultures are less direct. Collective societies produce team players while individualistic ones are far more likely to produce and reward superstars. 1 - 2. What way of organizing a comparison and contrast is shown in paragraph 1? In paragraph 2? 3.-4. What transitional words or cohesive devices are used in paragraph1? What about in paragraph 2?​</a>

                                            Instruction: Read the essay "Why Life is Important" and then write the summary. Why is Life Important? One important aspect of Life is that it keeps going forward. This means nothing is permanent. Hence, there should be a reason to stay in dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one. Above all, one must be optimistic no matter how bad things get. This is because nothing will stay forever. Every situation, occasion, and event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life. Many people become very sad because of failures. However, these people certainly fail to see the bright side. The bright side is that there is a reason for every failure. Therefore, every failure teaches us a valuable lesson. This means every failure builds experience. This experience is what improves the skills and efficiency of humans. Probably a huge number of individuals complain that Life is a pain. Many people believe that the word pain is a synonym for Life. However, it is pain that makes us stronger. Pain is certainly an excellent way of increasing mental resilience. Above all, pain enriches the mind.  The uncertainty of death is what makes life so precious. No one knows the hour of one's death. This probably is the most important reason to live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic is an utter wastage of Life. One must certainly enjoy the beautiful blessings of Life before death overtakes.​</a>

                                            deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. they clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. they also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. in the past fifty years, more than half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. one solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. if you use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. how can you use less paper? one answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. a second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. the backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. a final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. most schools, offices, and districts have recycling center. if you follow the three rs – reduce, reuse, and recycle –, you can help save the world’s forests

Dear Mom, I think we should get a pet dog. Dogs make great pets because they are loyal. I have heard of a dog who did not leave its master even when the master died. According to scientists, dogs have evolved to be loyal to humans. They also help deter criminals, like thieves. When dogs bark, criminals become afraid. Dogs growl at people they think are a threat. They also help boost people's moods because they are friendly and playful. Doctors have even found that owning a dog can improve a person's health. According to them, dogs reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and they help prevent allergies, asthma, and eczema in children! You might think that I am not responsible enough to have a pet dog. But, I have demonstrated responsibility by making my bed every morning and doing my homework every afternoon. I know that I would be responsible for walking our pet dog and cleaning up after it. Getting a pet dog would be good for our whole family! Love, Natalie​</a>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The physical similarities between humans and other mammals are quite plain. We are made of the same flesh and blood; we go through the same basic life stages. Yet reminders of our shared inheritance with other animals have become the subject of cultural taboos: sex, menstruation, pregnancy, birth, feeding, defecation, urination, bleeding, illness, and dying. Messy stuff. However, even if we try to throw a veil over it, the evidence for evolutionary continuity between human and animal bodies is overwhelming. After all, we can use mammalian organs and tissues, such as a pig's heart valve, to replace our own malfunctioning body parts. </p><p></p><br />

                            4. ParagraphDirections: Read and understand the paragraphs below, then answer the questions thatfollow. Write them on the second column.Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty tolook at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food,fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, morethan half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! Scientists say that if deforestationcontinues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, andanimals will die.One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. If you use lesspaper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answeris to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists orPhone messages and when you write a rought draft of an essay write on back of.AnswerQuestion1.

                            5. Instruction: Read the essay "Why Life is Important" and then write the summary. Why is Life Important? One important aspect of Life is that it keeps going forward. This means nothing is permanent. Hence, there should be a reason to stay in dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one. Above all, one must be optimistic no matter how bad things get. This is because nothing will stay forever. Every situation, occasion, and event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life. Many people become very sad because of failures. However, these people certainly fail to see the bright side. The bright side is that there is a reason for every failure. Therefore, every failure teaches us a valuable lesson. This means every failure builds experience. This experience is what improves the skills and efficiency of humans. Probably a huge number of individuals complain that Life is a pain. Many people believe that the word pain is a synonym for Life. However, it is pain that makes us stronger. Pain is certainly an excellent way of increasing mental resilience. Above all, pain enriches the mind. The uncertainty of death is what makes life so precious. No one knows the hour of one's death. This probably is the most important reason to live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic is an utter wastage of Life. One must certainly enjoy the beautiful blessings of Life before death overtakes. a​</h2><br />

Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Yes, I believe that man is a social animal because humans have a natural instinct to live in society with other human beings.</p><p></p><p>2. Man becomes a social animal by forming social groups with common interests and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background, and other personal qualities.</p><p></p><p>3.

                            11. C. Open-Ended Questions. Read the essay thoroughly. Then, answer the questions that follow. Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants? Excerpt from an essay written by Kris Gledhill After England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day." Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people. Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method." Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee. So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing. In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included. We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene? Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures." The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal. 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>
</p>1.	What is the editorial’s main point?  <p>The central point of the editorial is to question whether United Kingdom should be accounted for causing the rising of cases and deaths due to COVID19. Although they are among the countries who have launched the vaccination drive, the new variant has originated from their country.  </p><p>
</p>2.	Is there evidence to back up the main point? Give three examples.  Among these evidences are;
<p>a.	UK’s premature lifting of COVID19 protocols
</p><p>b.	UK failed the rising cases and number of deaths immediately
</p><p>c.	They reopened without thinking that not all Britons are vaccinated and thus exposing them even further.  </p><p>
</p>3.	How would you describe the editorial board’s argument?  <p>The editorial board’s argument are counterintuitive yet informative. However, it is obviously not siding the UK government and that is Boris Johnson.  </p>4.	Comment on the language and words used in the reading material.  <p>The language and choice words are not that hard to understand. Although there are technical terms, the context clues were a large help to get the whole picture of a sentence.  </p><p>

                            15. Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants?                            Excerpt from an essay written by Kris GledhillAfter England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day" Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people.Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method"Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee.So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing.In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included.We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene?Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures" The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal.1. What is the editorial's main point?2. Is there evidence to back up the main point? Give three examples.3.

                            17. Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

Having read all these details about the bill, especially the statement of the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights about the broad definition of the word “terrorism” which caused confusion or worse misunderstanding and disagreement, it is safe to say that certain words can evoke feelings or make people think in a different way.

Directions: Write TRUE if the statement is correct; otherwise, replace the underlined word/s to make the statement correct. (15 items x 2 point)
 1. Since the meaning of a word can change through time and the perception of any word can also be interpreted differently by people, it is necessary to put a denotation so that there is an experience-based definition in the essay.
 2. Connotation and extended definition are optional in writing a definition essay because people have different interpretations of words and concepts and including them would only confuse readers.
 3. The process of explaining and giving examples to clarify how the writer understand a concept is called persuasion.
 4. The main purpose of exemplification is to make even more understandable complex ideas, concepts, words, and expressions to your target readers.
 5. Enumerating facts is a technique in exemplification that relies on the individual interpretations of people on certain events, situations, ideas and concepts in supporting your point.
 6. When dealing with a Supportive Audience, pathos is the most effective appeal that you can use.
 7. Specifically in essay writing, comparison cannot be done alone nor contrast because they are complementary to each other.
 8. Personification is a technique in comparison and contrast that assigns the characteristics of non-humans to human to personify the subject.
 9. Causal Analysis can be translated into this diagram:
EFFECTS → SITUATION → CAUSES. Meaning, the author may present the causes towards the effects, or begin with the effects and proceed towards cause.
 10. The effect is what prompted something to happen.
 11. Detailing the process and giving directions are parts of explanatory mode of paragraph development.
 12. Explanation or discussion aims to make the readers understand and explain a particular statement or a theory.
 13. Classification entails categorization, which enables one to group together items according to their similarities.
 14. Exclusiveness, in a paragraph of classification, is characterized by having parallel similarities in the divisions you make in your writing.
 15. Division is a technique in classification wherein the concept or topic is broken down into its essential parts.</h2><br />

                            21. Activity 2. Read and analyze the paragraphs below. Then answer the following questions: In many ways, fiction and non-fiction are different from each other. Fiction, which includes novels, short stories, poems and plays, interprets human experience through the presentation of fictitious persons or situations and not through actual truths about particular events or abstract relations between ideas and reality. It presents lifelike images of people and events to embody truths about man and the human condition. On the other hand, nonfiction such as essays and biographies present or interpret facts, experiences, ideas or events, and make us appreciate the strangeness, the humor or the tragedy inherent in or connected with them. It discusses factual information and ideas to satisfy people's need for understanding and cognition. Individualistic and collectivist cultures vary in many ways. Members of an individualistic culture view their primary responsibility as helping themselves, whereas people in collective cultures feel loyalties and obligations to an in-group or one's extended family, community or organization. Individualistic cultures are also characterized by self-reliance and competition while members of a collective culture are more attentive to and concerned with the welfare of significant others. In handling disagreements, individualistic societies are relatively tolerant of conflicts and use a direct, solution - oriented approach. In contrast, members of collective cultures are less direct. Collective societies produce team players while individualistic ones are far more likely to produce and reward superstars. 1 - 2.

                            24. Instruction: Read the essay "Why Life is Important" and then write the summary. Why is Life Important? One important aspect of Life is that it keeps going forward. This means nothing is permanent. Hence, there should be a reason to stay in dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one. Above all, one must be optimistic no matter how bad things get. This is because nothing will stay forever. Every situation, occasion, and event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life. Many people become very sad because of failures. However, these people certainly fail to see the bright side. The bright side is that there is a reason for every failure. Therefore, every failure teaches us a valuable lesson. This means every failure builds experience. This experience is what improves the skills and efficiency of humans. Probably a huge number of individuals complain that Life is a pain. Many people believe that the word pain is a synonym for Life. However, it is pain that makes us stronger. Pain is certainly an excellent way of increasing mental resilience. Above all, pain enriches the mind.  The uncertainty of death is what makes life so precious. No one knows the hour of one's death. This probably is the most important reason to live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic is an utter wastage of Life. One must certainly enjoy the beautiful blessings of Life before death overtakes.​</h2><br />

                            26. deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. they clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. they also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. in the past fifty years, more than half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. one solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. if you use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. how can you use less paper? one answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. a second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. the backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. a final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. most schools, offices, and districts have recycling center. if you follow the three rs – reduce, reuse, and recycle –, you can help save the world’s forests

Dear Mom, I think we should get a pet dog. Dogs make great pets because they are loyal. I have heard of a dog who did not leave its master even when the master died. According to scientists, dogs have evolved to be loyal to humans. They also help deter criminals, like thieves. When dogs bark, criminals become afraid. Dogs growl at people they think are a threat. They also help boost people's moods because they are friendly and playful. Doctors have even found that owning a dog can improve a person's health. According to them, dogs reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and they help prevent allergies, asthma, and eczema in children! You might think that I am not responsible enough to have a pet dog. But, I have demonstrated responsibility by making my bed every morning and doing my homework every afternoon. I know that I would be responsible for walking our pet dog and cleaning up after it. Getting a pet dog would be good for our whole family! Love, Natalie​</h2><br />
