                                            Directions: Read a debate piece to identify pure opinions by answering the questions that followDebate Topic: Replacing textbooks with tablets in schoolsPro Debater: My personal view is that mandating to replace textbooks with tablets will be beneficial since it poses littledisadvantages. Tablets increase standardized test scores. A research study, conducted in Auburn, Maine, showed thatkindergarten students using iPads scored much higher on literacy tests than students that did not use the device. I think,this is the primary advantage of using tablets over books.Aside from that, tablets cost 50%-60% less than textbooks. According to the FCC, the U.S. spends about $7 billion peryear on textbooks, but many of them are seven to ten years out of date. Advocates claim that using tablets instead willsave money and improve learning.Personally, and practically speaking, tablets are lighter than textbooks, as well. Between studying, homework, andextracurricular activities, going back to school may make kids feel like they have the weight of the world on theirshoulders. And sometimes, they literally do. After you pile a lunch, school supplies, binders, and textbooks - whichtypically weigh 3.5 lbs. each-into a child's backpack, the load he or she is fugging around could be huge .. andpotentially dangerous. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, at least 14,000 children are treatedfor backpack-related injuries every year.Questions:1. What is the opinion of the debater on replacing books with tablets? Identity words or phrases that reveal thedebater's opinion/s about it.​</a>

It’s an amazing book about a man called Frankenstein who is a scientist. He’s obsessed with creating life. He creates this monster out of different body parts. He brings it to life using electricity. The monster escapes. Frankenstein wants to forget the whole experiment. The monster tracks him down. He wants revenge. He gets it.2.	Gordon Brown took over from Tony Blair as Prime Minister in 2007. It was not an enviable task. Tony Blair was a master of the media and a good speaker. Gordon Brown appeared rather clumsy and boring. He was left with Blair’s unpopular policies. Like the war in Iraq.3.	For the Liberal Party the election system is a huge disadvantage. They have supporters in all parts of the country and in all social classes. They are the third-largest party. Most of the votes they get are wasted. Their representation in Parliament is far below their popularity among the electorate. 4.	The electoral system is not without its advantages. It usually provides governments with workable majorities. That makes it easier to carry out policies. It provides stability. Extremist or special interest parties have little chance of getting elected. It ensures that each constituent in the country has a personal representative in Parliament.(Thanks in advance) &lt;/3​</a>

Then answer and discuss the questions at the end of the story.Jane and Rose are best of friends working in the same agency. While they were having their coffee break one day, Rose having three children going to school complained to Jane how difficult to make ends meet with the meager salary they are receiving. When Jane heard her friend, she said “why don’t you put-up a sideline? You are a good cook. You can sell peanut adobo, brittle, peanut butter or other food products. I am sure you will not have problems in terms of raw materials because these raw materials are abundant in our community.Rose is sold to the idea and persuaded her friend to be her partner. The two friends contributed P2,000.00 each to start the business. They agreed to have equal profit. Rose would take care of production while Jane will concentrate in marketing. Jane started getting orders while Rose concentrated in cooking. When they succeeded in getting big orders, they decided to register their business as a partnership under the name R &amp; J Food Products. From then on, their customers have regular orders and even becoming bigger.After six months of operation, the partners earned P20,000.00 and they decided to divide it equally between them. Meanwhile, Rose was exhausting herself with her production efforts, while Jane’s life went on very casually because once the first orders have been booked, most of the buyers placed repeated orders.Before the business reached its first-year anniversary, Rose got sick and advised to rest. Rose can no longer cook and Rose husbands forbade her to continue the business.1. What went wrong with the business? 2. If you were Rose would you enter into a partnership with a friend or would you register the venture as a sole proprietorship?3. Were the partners right in splitting the profits equally? 4.

                            6. Directions: Read a debate piece to identify pure opinions by answering the questions that followDebate Topic: Replacing textbooks with tablets in schoolsPro Debater: My personal view is that mandating to replace textbooks with tablets will be beneficial since it poses littledisadvantages. Tablets increase standardized test scores. A research study, conducted in Auburn, Maine, showed thatkindergarten students using iPads scored much higher on literacy tests than students that did not use the device. I think,this is the primary advantage of using tablets over books.Aside from that, tablets cost 50%-60% less than textbooks. According to the FCC, the U.S. spends about $7 billion peryear on textbooks, but many of them are seven to ten years out of date. Advocates claim that using tablets instead willsave money and improve learning.Personally, and practically speaking, tablets are lighter than textbooks, as well. Between studying, homework, andextracurricular activities, going back to school may make kids feel like they have the weight of the world on theirshoulders. And sometimes, they literally do. After you pile a lunch, school supplies, binders, and textbooks - whichtypically weigh 3.5 lbs. each-into a child's backpack, the load he or she is fugging around could be huge .. andpotentially dangerous. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, at least 14,000 children are treatedfor backpack-related injuries every year.Questions:1.

Then, rewrite them using the changes you would like to incorporate.1.	The book I would choose to take on a desert island is a book called Frankenstein. It’s an amazing book about a man called Frankenstein who is a scientist. He’s obsessed with creating life. He creates this monster out of different body parts. He brings it to life using electricity. The monster escapes. Frankenstein wants to forget the whole experiment. The monster tracks him down. He wants revenge. He gets it.2.	Gordon Brown took over from Tony Blair as Prime Minister in 2007. It was not an enviable task. Tony Blair was a master of the media and a good speaker. Gordon Brown appeared rather clumsy and boring. He was left with Blair’s unpopular policies. Like the war in Iraq.3.	For the Liberal Party the election system is a huge disadvantage. They have supporters in all parts of the country and in all social classes. They are the third-largest party. Most of the votes they get are wasted. Their representation in Parliament is far below their popularity among the electorate. 4.	The electoral system is not without its advantages. It usually provides governments with workable majorities. That makes it easier to carry out policies. It provides stability.

                            12. Activity Read the following carefully. Then answer and discuss the questions at the end of the story.Jane and Rose are best of friends working in the same agency. While they were having their coffee break one day, Rose having three children going to school complained to Jane how difficult to make ends meet with the meager salary they are receiving. When Jane heard her friend, she said “why don’t you put-up a sideline? You are a good cook. You can sell peanut adobo, brittle, peanut butter or other food products. I am sure you will not have problems in terms of raw materials because these raw materials are abundant in our community.Rose is sold to the idea and persuaded her friend to be her partner. The two friends contributed P2,000.00 each to start the business. They agreed to have equal profit. Rose would take care of production while Jane will concentrate in marketing. Jane started getting orders while Rose concentrated in cooking. When they succeeded in getting big orders, they decided to register their business as a partnership under the name R &amp; J Food Products. From then on, their customers have regular orders and even becoming bigger.After six months of operation, the partners earned P20,000.00 and they decided to divide it equally between them. Meanwhile, Rose was exhausting herself with her production efforts, while Jane’s life went on very casually because once the first orders have been booked, most of the buyers placed repeated orders.Before the business reached its first-year anniversary, Rose got sick and advised to rest. Rose can no longer cook and Rose husbands forbade her to continue the business.1. What went wrong with the business? 2. If you were Rose would you enter into a partnership with a friend or would you register the venture as a sole proprietorship?3. Were the partners right in splitting the profits equally? 4. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of partnership.​please pa answer po kahit dalawang questions lang</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) since rose got sick, she wasn't able to cook anymore that made the productions stop. </p><p>2) I would register it as a partnership since we are both helping each other to make the business grow</p><p>3) no, for me, I don't think it's right because the heavy works are on Rose since she is the one who's producing the products</p><p>4) the advantage of partnership is that they are both helping each other, one on the production and the other one is managing the business. The disadvantage is that the harder works are on the person only</p><br />
