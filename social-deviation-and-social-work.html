                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The study of Social Deviance is the study of the violation of cultural norms in either formal (criminal) or informal (deviant) contexts.</p><p></p><p>Social deviance is a phenomenon that has existed in all societies where there have been norms. There are two possibilities for how an individual will act in the face of social norms; conform or violate. There are implicit social norms and explicit social norms. Explicit social norms are not necessarily laws (such as a sign at a computer lab that says food and drink are prohibited). In reality, there is often a blend of conformity and deviance in the ways people behave. Rarely if ever does a person deviate from or conform to all norms. Furthermore, some behaviors in themselves reflect both conformity and deviance at once. Consider breaking the speed limit, which is technically a legal violation, but which is also conformist, particularly on freeways where motorists "go with the flow." That is a critical feature of deviance, conformity, and norms. Relativity abounds. That is, norms can change over time (e.g. women in the paid labor force), depend on situational context (e.g. laughing at a party as opposed to doing so at a funeral), depend on statuses (e.g. an adolescent blowing up neighbors' mailboxes as opposed to an elderly woman doing so), and any number of other factors. But it's not all relative. There are forms of deviance (and certain norms) that are about as universal as anything in the social sciences can be, such as when one maliciously harms a child. In light of the way we think about norms, deviance, and conformity, many thinkers throughout history have tried to explain the causes behind deviance.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>make it brainliest it's a big help for me tysm btw stay safe and ur family.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>As the Supreme Court readies its long-awaited ruling on same-sex marriage, two Pew Research Center surveys this spring — one of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender adults and the other of the American public — found a common thread: that society as a whole has become more accepting of gays and lesbians.<br /><br />That finding has its caveats. While an overwhelming number (92%) of LBGT adults saw society as having become more accepting over the last decade, many reported continued discrimination, taking various forms. On the part of the general public, opposition to same-sex marriage remains substantial, and religious beliefs are a major factor. Just under half of Americans (45%) say they think engaging in homosexual behavior is a sin.</p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Social problems are part of the price of social change. Periods of rapid change may bring about the disequilibrium and dis-organisation of formal functioning of society. ADVERTISEMENTS: Social change considered generally desirable in society may precipitate and increase social problems.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It's the progress</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Why? because social problem tend to implicate the community which social change happened because we tried to make resolution about the problem and we are aiming for it to succeed and given that we succeed, that can be called as a social change. Also social problem is related to disorganisation because it's the negative results of the problem that makes something as disorganized. For an insurance, a person who had a family problem and because of the problem, a person can be out of his mind and leads him to do something frivolous and that's makes disorganized. Deviation happened when we tried to escape and because it's a social problem sometimes we escape from it because we're afraid of being affected by it.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> The authors evaluated emotional distress among 9th-12th grade students, and examined whether the association between LGBT status and emotional distress was mediated by perceptions of having been treated badly or discriminated against because others thought they were gay or lesbian. Data come from a school-based survey in Boston, MA (n=1,032); 10% were LGBT, 58% were female, and age ranged from 13-19 years. About 45% were Black, 31% were Hispanic, and 14% were White.

Social control refers to ways in which a society tries to prevent and sanction behavior that violates norms.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>we now turn to the major sociological explanations of crime and deviance. ...

                            30. 3. Conformity as a social influence has both positive and negative effects. Why is conformity sometimes not a good thing?
a. Conformity is always a good thing and everyone should adhere to it.
b. It may threaten individuation on our part.
c. Deviating from the behavior of the majority is productive
d. It is always best that people all behave differently</h2><br />
                        <p>The correct answer is <strong>b. It may threaten individuation on our part.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>           While conformity can lead to social harmony and cohesion, it can also have negative effects, particularly when it leads to the suppression of individuality and critical thinking. When individuals conform to social norms or the behavior of the majority, they may feel pressured to give up their own beliefs, values, or opinions. This can lead to a loss of personal identity and creativity, as well as a lack of diversity in thoughts and ideas. Furthermore, conformity can also lead to groupthink, which can result in poor decision-making and harmful behaviors.</p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>B. It may threaten individuation on our part.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Succumbing to peer pressure could lead to risky or illegal behavior, such as underage drinking. Or, conformity might lead to a bystander effect, in which going along with the group means failing to act when someone is in need. A desire to conform might also limit your openness to new ideas or arguments.</strong></p><br />
