                                            The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</a>

                            18. The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</h2><br />
