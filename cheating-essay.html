                                            Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                        <strong>Persuasive essay starter:</strong><p></p><p>Cheating in school is a serious offense and should not be taken lightly. I believe that cheating in school is wrong and should be punished. Cheating is a form of dishonest and unethical behavior that shows a lack of respect for one's education. It is also unfair to students who put in the work but do not receive the same recognition as those who cheat. If you think you can get away with cheating, take a good look at how your choices affect yourself and those around you. It is important to take personal responsibility for your actions and understand the consequences of cheating in school.</p><br />

                            2. Persuasive essay about punishment for cheating</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cheating is a serious offense that undermines the integrity of education and the values of honesty and hard work. It is a form of academic dishonesty that not only harms the cheater, but also the entire educational community. Therefore, it is important that schools and universities enforce strict punishments for cheating in order to maintain a fair and just learning environment.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, cheating undermines the purpose of education, which is to learn and grow intellectually. Cheating is an unethical shortcut that may result in a better grade, but it fails to achieve the true goal of education. Students who cheat are not learning the material and are not acquiring the skills they need to succeed in the future. This can have long-term consequences for their academic and professional careers. Punishing cheaters sends a message that cheating is not acceptable and that the pursuit of knowledge is valued above all else.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, cheating violates the trust between students and teachers, as well as between students and their peers. It undermines the credibility of academic achievement and diminishes the value of hard work. Cheating also creates an unequal playing field, where some students gain an unfair advantage over others. Punishing cheaters helps to restore the trust between students, teachers, and the educational system as a whole.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, cheating can have severe consequences for the cheater. Not only can it result in academic sanctions such as failing grades or suspension, but it can also have long-lasting effects on a student's personal and professional reputation. Cheating can damage a student's integrity and credibility, which can have serious consequences in the future when applying for jobs or further education. Punishments for cheating can serve as a deterrent and encourage students to make the right choices.</p><p></p><p> cheating is a serious offense that undermines the integrity of education and harms the educational community as a whole. Punishing cheaters is necessary in order to uphold the values of honesty and hard work, restore trust between students and teachers, and deter students from engaging in academic dishonesty. By enforcing strict punishments for cheating, we can maintain a fair and just learning environment that values the pursuit of knowledge and the importance of academic integrity.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><p></p><p>Persuasive essay about punishment for cheating</p><p></p>Cheating is a serious crime that undermines the integrity of the education system. To maintain fairness and honesty, it is necessary to properly punish cheaters. The penalty for fraud should be severe enough to deter others from doing the same, but also fair and equitable. <p></p>By implementing strict consequences, we ensure that students understand the seriousness of their actions and are held accountable for their behavior. Finally, punishing cheating is necessary to maintain the credibility and value of education.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>the inability to marry another after cheating on a partner siguro</p><p><strong>Answer: Cheating has become a prevalent issue in many educational institutions, ranging from schools to universities. Cheating can take many forms, including plagiarism, copying homework or exams, and sharing answers. The consequences of cheating can be severe, as it undermines the integrity of the educational system and puts honest students at a disadvantage. Thus, it is crucial to establish an appropriate punishment for cheating to discourage students from engaging in such behaviors.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One potential punishment for cheating is academic suspension or expulsion. When a student is caught cheating, they may be suspended from school for a certain period or expelled altogether. This punishment serves as a severe consequence for the student, as it can significantly impact their academic progress and future prospects. However, this punishment should be reserved for severe cases of cheating or repeated offenses, as it may not be the most effective or appropriate solution for all situations.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another possible punishment is a grade reduction or zero grade on the assignment or exam in question. This punishment communicates to the student that their actions were unacceptable and affects their academic record. However, this punishment may not be effective for all students, as some may not value grades or may be willing to take the risk of receiving a low grade in exchange for cheating.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In addition to these punishments, schools may also implement preventive measures to discourage cheating, such as educating students on academic integrity and creating a culture of honesty and fairness. By promoting a positive attitude towards academic honesty, students may be less likely to cheat in the first place.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Overall, the punishment for cheating should be proportional to the severity of the offense and serve as a deterrent for future misconduct. While suspension or expulsion may be appropriate in some cases, a reduction in grade or zero grade may be sufficient for others. Educating students on academic integrity and fostering a culture of honesty may also play an essential role in preventing cheating. Ultimately, it is crucial for educational institutions to address cheating and establish clear consequences to uphold academic integrity and ensure a fair and equitable learning environment for all students.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: you said essay so its long</strong></p><p></p><br />

Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cheating in school has become a prevalent issue, and it not only undermines the integrity of education but also deprives students of learning valuable life skills such as honesty, hard work, and responsibility. Therefore, it is essential to establish a system of punishment that is effective in deterring cheating behavior and promoting academic integrity.</p><p></p><p>One of the most common forms of cheating in school is cheating on exams. Students who cheat on exams undermine the fairness and validity of the assessment process, and this behavior can have a detrimental effect on the student's academic performance and future prospects. Therefore, it is necessary to establish strict penalties for students who cheat on exams.</p><p></p><p>One effective punishment for cheating on exams is to invalidate the student's test results and require the student to retake the exam under strict supervision. Additionally, schools could implement a policy of zero-tolerance for cheating on exams, which could result in the student being suspended or expelled from school. These consequences would serve as a powerful deterrent to students who might be tempted to cheat.</p><p></p><p>Cheating on homework assignments and projects is also a significant problem in schools. These assignments are intended to help students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and time-management skills. Cheating on these assignments undermines the purpose of the assignment and deprives students of the opportunity to develop these skills. Therefore, schools should establish a system of penalties for students who cheat on homework assignments and projects.</p><p></p><p>One effective punishment for cheating on homework assignments and projects is to give the student a failing grade for the assignment or project. Additionally, the student could be required to redo the assignment or project, and their grade would be reduced accordingly. Schools could also implement a policy of reporting cheating incidents to colleges and universities, which could impact the student's future academic and career prospects.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, cheating in school is a significant problem that needs to be addressed with effective punishments. It is essential to establish a system of penalties that is strict enough to deter cheating behavior and promote academic integrity. By punishing students who cheat on exams, homework assignments, and projects, we can ensure that they learn the valuable life skills of honesty, hard work, and responsibility, and we can protect the integrity of the education system</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Academic integrity is a fundamental value in any educational institution, and cheating is a clear violation of this principle. Cheating undermines the educational process and creates an unfair advantage for students who do not deserve it. Therefore, it is crucial that schools take a strong stance against cheating by punishing students who engage in this behavior.</p><p></p><p>One of the most effective ways to deter cheating is to impose strict penalties that send a clear message that such behavior will not be tolerated. In this regard, suspension is an appropriate punishment for students who cheat. By suspending students who cheat, schools send a message that cheating is a serious offense that will result in severe consequences.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a suspension from school is a significant consequence that can have a lasting impact on a student's academic and personal life. It can affect their ability to graduate on time, their eligibility for scholarships, and their future career prospects. A suspension can also be a wake-up call for students who are struggling academically, reminding them of the importance of honesty and hard work.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why suspension is an appropriate punishment for cheating is that it protects the integrity of the school's academic program. When students cheat, they undermine the value of the degrees and diplomas awarded by the institution. This, in turn, can hurt the reputation of the school and its graduates. By punishing students who cheat with suspension, schools demonstrate that they take academic integrity seriously and are committed to maintaining a high standard of education.</p><p></p><p>Finally, suspending students who cheat is an essential step in helping them learn from their mistakes. By removing them from the school environment for a period of time, students can reflect on their behavior and the consequences of their actions. They can use this time to seek help, improve their study habits, and develop a stronger sense of academic integrity.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, cheating is a serious offense that undermines the educational process and creates an unfair advantage for dishonest students. Therefore, schools must take a strong stance against cheating by imposing strict penalties, including suspension. By doing so, they protect the integrity of their academic program, deter future cheating, and help students learn from their mistakes.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cheating in class is a serious offense with potential consequences for a student's academic future. It compromises the credibility of the educational system, interferes with the fairness of grades, and eventually prevents a student from developing their character. Therefore, it is crucial that schools take a firm position against cheating and discipline offenders. These are three reasons why suspension is a good deterrent for cheating.</p><p></p><p>Suspending cheaters sends a clear message that it is unacceptable. Cheating undermines the principles of honesty, integrity, and hard effort that schools want to foster in their students. Schools demonstrate that these values are more than simply platitudes by suspending cheaters, demonstrating that the school community takes these values seriously. Students who may be considering cheating in the future may be discouraged by the fear of punishment.</p><p></p><p>Suspension is a justifiable punishment for cheating. Cheating gives a student the opportunity to receive a mark that they did not merit, which can have a big impact on their academic achievement. Students who put in extra effort and honestly earn their grades, however, may feel taken advantage of and underappreciated. The act of suspending a cheating student aids in restoring the fairness of the grading system and conveys the idea that academic success should only come from perseverance and hard effort.</p><p></p><p>The student's personal development may also benefit by suspending cheaters from class. A suspension might act as a warning for students who may be engaging in cheating due to personal problems, such as worry or stress. They may find it to be a worthwhile chance to think back on what they did, ask for assistance if necessary, and focus on improving their study habits and coping mechanisms. Also, a suspension might motivate kids to make better decisions in the future by teaching them the repercussions of their behavior.</p><p></p><p>The virtues of honesty, integrity, and hard effort that schools try to impart in their students are undercut by cheating, which is a serious infraction. Students who cheat are suspended, which conveys a clear message that cheating is not acceptable, maintains the fairness of the grading scale, and gives room for personal development. In order to effectively punish cheating pupils, schools should adopt a firm anti-cheating attitude and adopt suspension.</p><p></p><p>This is <strong>NOT PLAGIARIZED ANSWER</strong>, if you want to check it out you can use plagiarism checker</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cheating is a common problem that can occur in various fields, including academic, professional, and personal settings. It is an unethical behavior that undermines the integrity and fairness of the system, causing harm to individuals and society as a whole. Therefore, it is essential to have a punishment that can deter people from cheating and maintain the trust and credibility of the system. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of punishing cheating and suggest some possible penalties that could be imposed.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, punishing cheating is necessary to deter others from engaging in similar behavior. When individuals see that there are no consequences for cheating, they may be more likely to do so themselves, as they believe they can get away with it. On the other hand, if they see that cheaters are punished severely, they will be less inclined to cheat, knowing that they risk being caught and facing the consequences. Therefore, a punishment for cheating serves as a warning to others, encouraging them to play by the rules and maintain the integrity of the system.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, punishing cheating is important to maintain the fairness and credibility of the system. Cheating undermines the hard work and effort of those who follow the rules and can lead to an unfair advantage for those who cheat. This can create a sense of frustration and demotivation among those who have been wronged, leading to a loss of trust in the system. Punishing cheating helps to ensure that everyone is on a level playing field, and that those who cheat are not rewarded for their misconduct.</p><p></p><p>Finally, punishing cheating can also serve as a way to rehabilitate the offender. By imposing a penalty, the individual is made aware of the severity of their actions and the harm they have caused. This can lead to a sense of remorse and the willingness to make amends for their behavior. Therefore, a punishment for cheating can be used as a means of education and rehabilitation, helping to prevent future instances of cheating.</p><p></p><p>In terms of possible punishments for cheating, there are several options. For example, in academic settings, cheating can result in a failing grade, suspension or expulsion from the institution, or revocation of academic credentials. In professional settings, cheating can lead to job loss, revocation of professional licenses, or even legal action. In personal relationships, cheating can result in the loss of trust and the breakdown of the relationship. Therefore, the punishment for cheating should be tailored to the specific context and severity of the offense.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, punishing cheating is essential to maintain the integrity and fairness of the system, deter others from engaging in similar behavior, and provide an opportunity for rehabilitation. Possible punishments include failing grades, suspension or expulsion, job loss, revocation of professional licenses, legal action, or the loss of trust in personal relationships. By imposing a penalty for cheating, individuals are reminded of the importance of playing by the rules and the consequences of their actions.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cheating is a dishonest act that undermines the integrity of academic, professional, or personal relationships. It can take many forms, from copying answers on a test to plagiarizing an entire paper. Regardless of the severity of the offense, cheating is a serious matter that requires appropriate consequences to deter future misconduct.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to determining the punishment for cheating, there are a few factors to consider. First, the severity of the offense should be taken into account. Did the cheating involve a minor infraction, such as copying a few answers on a quiz, or was it a more serious offense, such as stealing an exam or plagiarizing a major assignment?</p><p></p><p>Next, the context of the cheating should be considered. Was the cheating intentional, or was it the result of a misunderstanding or lack of knowledge? Was the cheating an isolated incident, or is there a pattern of misconduct?</p><p></p><p>Finally, the punishment should be appropriate to the goals of the institution or organization. In an academic setting, for example, the goal may be to ensure the integrity of the grading process and maintain academic standards. In a professional setting, the goal may be to uphold ethical standards and protect the reputation of the organization.</p><p></p><p>With these factors in mind, there are several possible punishments for cheating. In an academic setting, a common punishment is to give the student a failing grade on the assignment or test in question. In more serious cases, the student may be failed in the course or even expelled from the institution.</p><br />
