                                            Reflect on your current circumstance. Compare your technological advantage over Rizal in his time. Identify how he was able to look for knowledge? How did he manage to go about living full time without a smart phone or the Internet? Will such full life be possible today without those advances? How will you use them to your advantage? If you have an advocacy, what would it be? Will it change the world? If you encounter difficulty? How will you remind yourself to keep on going? Or will you give up, despite knowing that Rizal did not?​</a>

I'm Kate. I want to write about my mobile phone. I got it from my parents for my birthday two years ago. I like it very much and I think it's sometimes good to have it in my bag. I always keep it in my bag or in my pocket so my parents and my friends can always call me. It's got a calculator in it so I sometimes use it at school. I can use my mobile phone to connect to the Internet and look through the news or read emails. Isn't it fantastic? Last year I was on a cycling holiday with my friend. We went cycling but the weather wasn't good. It was cold and windy. It started to rain and it got dark. Suddenly my friend fell off her bike and she broke her leg. At first I didn't know what to do but I thought about my phone. It was in my backpack so I called for help. After fifteen minutes a doctor arrived. Sometimes people are not used on exploring their mobile phones which is a big problem because mobile phones plays a very important role in our daily life especially we are now in a digital world. Mobile phones can help us do our work easier and it helps us connected all throughout the world. I'm not crazy about my mobile phone but I feel safe when I have it with me. 1. Kate can't exist without her mobile phone. 2. She got her mobile phone in January. 3. She usually listens to music on her mobile phone. 4. There's a calculator in her mobile phone. 5. Her parents bought her the mobile phone two years ago..</a>

There is no reason to lack sleep since there are no smartphones or other gadgets that would make one sleep late. The scent of the sweet aroma of coffee would wake you up. </p><p>As the day starts, people would work on chores like cleaning the house or gardening. Some would even choose to paint or draw pictures.  At mid-day, mothers would start preparing food, cooking the family's favorite lunch. After eating a good meal, the family would have an afternoon nap. Some would go out to have small talks with neighbors. By the time the sun starts to set, everyone would gather inside the house to do some religious activities.  By the end of the day, when everyone has already eaten their dinner cooked by mom, everyone would be expected to sleep early. #BrainlyFast</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
