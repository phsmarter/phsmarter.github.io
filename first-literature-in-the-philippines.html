                                            3. The development of Philippine literature in English start- tality, considering various factors at work in the first years ed at a slow pace. This was no reflection on Filipino men- of the American occupation. First, it was humanly impos- sible for the Filipino nation to recover quickly from the paralyzing effects of the repression in thought and speech which has been their lot under Spanish rule. The Filipinos could not, therefore, take immediate advantage of their newly acquired right to be heard. Second, the Filipinos first had to learn a medium alien to them in its psychology, construction, sound, and spelling. Third, even if after they had learned the English language sufficiently for ordinary communication, they discovered that literary standards for English differed radically from those in the vernacular literatures (or in Spanish which formed part of the herit- age of the more fortunate).​</a>
