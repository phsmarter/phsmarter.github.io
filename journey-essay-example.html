                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Each person’s life is a journey on a contorted road dotted with bumps and craters. At certain points, the bumps could seem as high as mountains and the pits as deep as lots, making this journey called life appear quite despondent. Although occasionally, your predicaments are entirely fate’s blunders, but perchance, they are your own. Your personal characteristics roughly resemble a steering wheel for your journey. They could be positive traits, which could steer you on a more decent path; or negative traits, which could steer you to a path that’s, well… not so decent. Although you have no control over fate, you have power over your own “driving skills”, and could thus widen or narrow your chance for a smooth, prosperous journey. Also, it is beneficial to remember that you are not alone, for there are many other roads that coincide with yours, where others are conducting through their own journeys and floundering through their own bumps and craters as well. Drive together, and you could purvey support and encouragement for one another, and thus institute milder paths for all of you. Most prominently, no matter how harsh the terrain of your road becomes, just remember that you will pull through and be transformed for the better because of it.</p><p></p><p>This optimistic philosophy that I’ve adopted had been much solace to me in my own journey in becoming a successful high school student. It was not at all easy. Although fate has been overall lenient to me, it was my “driving skills” that tended to direct my course towards huge bumps. Despite my awareness of my own flaws and omissions, I still compulsorily reproached others and sought ways to exonerate myself. This was one of the worst traits I retain. It precluded me from obtaining responsibility for my choices and learning from past oversights, thus impeded my maturing process. For example, my projects were oftentimes undone till the last minute (including this one). I would think to myself, “I don’t feel like doing it today, so I’ll work on it tomorrow”. Thus the project was delayed further and further until there was no “tomorrow” for it anymore, and then I would end up working well over midnight while secretly scowling at the teacher for giving out such a tedious and inane assignment. Immaturity and refusal to admit my errors caused me to plunge into countless pits in my journey. The one positive trait that had proved to be highly efficient in boosting me out of these pits is ambition. I know that too much of it could corrupt a person, but so far it had only empowered my spirit with much-needed optimism. My greatest ambition is to become a renowned novelist; therefore every hardship and pain to me befits an inspiration for a potential novel. It is a most optimistic perception of things, and it had succoured me through many phases of emotional turmoil.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>My </strong><strong>direction</strong></p><p>(Own Experience)</p><p></p><p></p><p> I had only had a couple of friends and never really ventured out to make new friends. So, for the majority of that summer I kept to myself, and read the Twilight Saga. During my readings of the Twilight Saga, I became a major fan of the series. This was my very first ‘fandom’, of a long line that will soon come in the upcoming years. I was introduced to Tumblr, where all fan geeks like me gathered to share our feelings on books, music, and art that we liked. Through Tumblr, I was introduced fanfiction and fanart. This was how I got into drawing.</p><p></p><p>I still had no self esteem as an artist. When my mom would call me the little artist, I shrugged at this idea. In my mind, being an artist means you actually have to be good at.</p><p></p><p>The first couple drawings, as you would expect, were really terrible. I thought I was never going to become a good artist, but, for some reason, I kept trying. I needed to practice, so I looked up drawings from other people and tried to mimic. I would draw the same picture a couple times. By doing this, I was training my eyes to pick up details, without even realising at the time.</p><p></p><p>As time went on, I expanded my world by taking on more fandoms. By doing this, I expanded my fuel for more drawings. I continued to draw more often, and started to become better at it. Of course most of my drawings are fan art, but, it helped me improve my basic skills as an artist, such as detail, color, and proportion.</p><p></p><p>So we must all have perseverance. Not everything comes from luck, others come from hard work.  I am a student, striving for what I want to achieve and what can i be achieved.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>G</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dave Hood</p><p></p><p>One way to write a personal narrative in creative nonfiction is to tell a story about a journey. All journeys have a starting point and destination. The journey usually begins with some question, which the central character desires to learn from the journey.  Along the path, the character is a participant in a series of events, which impact his/her psyche. The character also faces setbacks and obstacles, encounters a crisis, participates in story that has  climax, and ends with a resolution. The journey also provides the character with new insights or illuminations, which help to answer a nagging question. Often the central character experiences an epiphany or a lesson that you learned.</p><p></p><p>This is certainly true for the creative nonfiction book, ” Into the Wild,” a true story written by Jon Krakauer,  about a young, idealistic man who abandons his possessions, gives away all of his $24,000 in a savings account, and then journeys across the United States, then to Alaska, where he dies by misadventure. It is a sad, true story of a journey about a naive man. Near death, dying from unintentional poisoning (He eat poison berries in an effort to prevent starvation), Christopher McCandless, the central character, realizes that “man cannot be an island unto himself.” Happiness must be shared.</p><p></p><p>Writing about a journey, a quest, or a pilgrimage is a popular form of creative nonfiction. Esteemed writer, E.B White, in his narrative a journey called “Walden”, shares a story about his trip to pay homage to Henry David Thoreau. (You can read it in Creative Nonfiction by Eileen Pollack) He writes about the trip by car, the surroundings at Walden pond, and personal reflections at Walden.</p><p></p><p>Author Elizabeth Gilbert wrote a bestselling book called “Eat, Pray, Love” in which she shares her journey to find herself after her marriage ends. She shares her reflections and describes the surroundings, adventures, new experiences, people she meets, cuisine, and culture while  traveling to Italy, India, Indonesia.</p><p></p><p>Not only can a writer craft essays about a journey, the writer can also write entire books about a journey. Author Michael Krasny wrote about a spiritual quest in “Spiritual Envy: An Agnostic’s Quest.” Krasny narrates a life story about his struggles with faith, his ambivalence toward religious doctrine, and his desire to answer a variety of metaphysical questions, such as Does God exist?</p><p></p><p>In this article, I’ll explain how write a personal essay or literary journalism essay about a journey, quest, or pilgrimage from a creative nonfiction perspective. First, I’ll define the difference between a journey, quest, and pilgrimage. Then I’ll explain the elements of a story, followed by an explanation of the narrative arc or story structure. Finally, I’ll identify a few tools and tips for writing about a journey, quest, or narrative.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Mas Mabuti Basahin muna ang nasa picture</p><p></p><p>This is to be continew</p><p></p><p></p><p>Then it happened. Burnout; Nervous Breakdown; Major Depressive Episode. The health professionals all had different labels. The truth was, I was broken. Pride comes before the fall. Here was the inevitable fall. In the matter of a single moment sitting in front of my computer screen, my entire life changed course. Nothing would ever be the same again. I did not realize it at the time and thought that a day off was all that was required. It was not to be. The psychologist had a serious talk to me and I realized the seriousness of the situation I found myself in. I kept wondering how I had missed all the signs? It was plain to see, constant high blood pressure, inability to sleep, growing anxiety, lack of boundaries, stress, the list was almost endless.</p><p></p><p>My journey had begun.</p><p></p><p>For the first time that I can recall I had no destination in mind. I was broken. I did not want to be anywhere or do anything. I had lost the will to live and I didn’t care. Looking back at that time I don’t even recall having thoughts. I either lay in bed or sat on a chair under a blanket. I simply existed, as if in some strange comatose state, whether this was brought on by the breakdown or the handful of tablets that I was required to take every day I am not sure. None the less I was little more than an inanimate object. My fiancé took great care of me, prepared meals, handled whatever business fallouts were taking place, encouraging me to rest and give it time, inviting me to try to make tiny steps towards recovery.</p><p></p><p>This was not how I imagined the journey would be. After all, when they say that it is about the journey, not the destination, one would think that the journey should at least be enjoyable. I could find absolutely no joy in anything.</p><p></p><p>There is also a saying that: “every cloud has a silver lining.” Fortunately, that has also proven to be true for me. My brother in law bought me a return ticket to go visit them in India, and I accepted the gift as I needed to just get away from the world. In March this year, I nervously embarked on a journey to go spend some time with them in India. I did not have any plans to do anything in India, and the main reason for me going was just to get away from everything for a while. Even if the only thing I did whilst I was in India was stay in their house for 6 weeks that would have worked for me.</p><p></p><p>Something inside me shifted though. The moment I said goodbye to my fiancé and stepdaughter and walked through to departures I knew that I was on my own from here. I knew that it was now up to me to create the context for how this journey would unfold.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong># Carry On learning</strong><br />

                        <p>My life journey has been incredible thus far, with every step I have taken growing my knowledge and understanding of the world I live in. It started out at a young age, when I was fortunate enough to have parents who encouraged me to try anything and everything. Whether it was a sport, a club, or a school subject, I was able to experience firsthand new activities, meet new people, and see new places. It was from this youthful curiosity that I began to learn about life and the world around me.</p><p></p><p>Throughout high school, I was able to focus this curiosity into different extracurricular activities and academic goals. Through rigorous classes, clubs, sports, and volunteer opportunities, I was able to make connections and form relationships with people of all backgrounds. I was given an incredible opportunity to travel throughout the United States, visiting places such as New York, California, and even the border of Mexico. I think these trips shaped my outlook on the world, introducing me to cultures I hadn't been previously exposed to, and it showed me the potential of what is out there in the world.</p><p></p><p>When it came time to choose which college I should go to, followed by what career path I should pursue, I was unaware of where this journey would take me. I knew I wanted to do something important, something that would make an impact on the world. This led me to pursue a degree in engineering, which has taken me on a path of growth and discovery. I had never been exposed to the world of engineering or technology before, but since entering this field, I have kept learning and pushing myself to my limits. I have had the pleasure of working with various people from around the world, of different backgrounds and cultures, and learning from each of them has added another layer to my journey of understanding.</p><p></p><p>No matter where this journey takes me, I will continue to strive for greatness. My dream is to create something that changes the lives of many, leaving a lasting impact on the world. As I continue to travel this path, my motivation to continue learning remains the same. With every step, I will continue to challenge myself and grow my knowledge so that I can make this dream come true.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My journey as a junior high school student has been a time of growth, learning, and discovery. During these years, I have had the opportunity to explore new subjects, meet new people, and develop new skills that will serve me well throughout my life.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant changes I experienced during my junior high school years was the shift from a more general education to a more specialized curriculum. As I moved from grade school to junior high school, I had the opportunity to study subjects in greater depth, such as science, math, and English. This allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of these subjects and prepare for the more advanced coursework that awaits me in high school and beyond.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of my junior high school journey has been the opportunity to make new friends and expand my social circle. As I entered a new school with new classmates, I had the chance to meet people from different backgrounds and with different interests. This allowed me to broaden my perspective, learn from others, and develop important social skills that will serve me well throughout my life.</p><p></p><p>Finally, my journey as a junior high school student has been characterized by a commitment to personal growth and development. I have learned the importance of hard work, dedication, and perseverance in achieving my goals, whether that be acing a test or mastering a new skill. I have also learned the value of seeking help when needed, whether that be from teachers, mentors, or peers, and the importance of taking care of my physical and mental health.</p><p></p><p>Overall, my journey as a junior high school student has been a time of growth, learning, and development. I am grateful for the experiences and opportunities that have come my way during these years and look forward to continuing my journey as I move on to high school and beyond</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There has never been a time when art critics held more power than during the second half of the twentieth century. Following the Second World War, with the relocation of the world’s artistic epicenter from Paris to New York, a different kind of war was waged in the pages of magazines across the country. As part of the larger “culture wars” of the mid-century, art critics began to take on greater influence than they’d ever held before. For a time, two critics in particular—who began as friends, and remained in the same social circles for much of their lives—set the stakes of the debates surrounding the maturation of American art that would continue for decades. The ideas about art outlined by Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg are still debated today, and the extent to which they were debated in the past has shaped entire movements of the arts. Below are ten works of criticism through which one can trace the mainstreaming of Clement Greenberg’s formalist theory, and how its dismantling led us into institutional critique and conceptual art today.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest mwaa</p><br />
