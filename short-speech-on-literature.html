It was through the baybayin that literary forms such as songs, riddles and proverbs, lyric and short poems as well as parts of epic poems were written. The bulk of these early literature however was just passed on through oral recitation and Incantation and were transcribed into the Roman alphabet only centuries later by Spanish chroniclers and other scholars.

EARLY PHILIPPINE LITERATURE (an excerpt) by Dr. Lilla Quindoza-Santiago The early inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago had a native alphabet or syllabory which among the Tagalogs was called baybayin, an inscription akin to Sanskrit. It was through the baybayin that literary forms such as songs, riddles and proverbs, lyric and short poems as well as parts of epic poems were written. The bulk of these early literature however was just passed on through oral recitation and Incantation and were transcribed into the Roman alphabet only centuries later by Spanish chroniclers and other scholars.
