                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The choices I make</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>
</p><p>People say that you make a lot of bad choices when you are young and I think they are right. The reason for that probably is because we do not believe in something until we ourselves experienced it. The choices that I made affected my life but it was actually blessings in disguise because I learned to be humble. In my family, it was not always harmonious. Sometimes, I always think that my family dislikes me so I sometimes run away from home. I ran away from home because I was badly reprimanded. I walked around the city with only a hundred peso in my pocket until I stumbled upon a makeshift house for construction workers. They shared me food and let me sleep under their unstable roof. They did not do anything bad to me and in fact, they taught me how to work. We shared stories and I discovered that they ran away from home, too, but they have more serious family problems than mine. I reflected on my self and I thought I was actually luckier. It has been a week and my parents are still looking for me when some policemen stopped by the makeshift house. They were very worried and my father was not feeling well because he is very worried, too. It was both a good and bad choice because, respectively, I have learned to appreciate my own life and become more humble and hardworking and it caused my parents so much pain.  </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/21214658</p><br />
