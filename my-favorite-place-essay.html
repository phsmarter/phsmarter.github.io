My Favorite Place
Usually when you ask people what thier favoryt place is, they will talk about a distant place - maybe a bichora
buetiful mounten. But my favoryt place is not far away at all. My favoryt place is a forest behind my hous.
Althugh the forest behind my haus is not very big, when I was litle I thout it was huge. There are so many intersting
places to play and hide. I can sit on the big rocks and have a picnic, I can claymb the tall trees. ori can look for lizards and
other litle animals
. Even tho I have played their many times. I can still spend all afterun running, playing ang hiking in the
forest behing my haus.
The forrest behind my haus is a magical place. If I am in a bad mood. I will go there to be alone and think. When
was a litle, I like to imaggine that there were magical people who lived in the forest. When I grow up and have chidren,
hope that they can leave near such a spaycial place too.</a>

My favorite place in my mother's house is the dining room. Every year my mother s house is chosen, by all of our family
members to host the holiday dinners and parties because of how elegant her dining room is.
As you walk thru the long narrow hallway on your way to the dining room you see the huge pictures of family members
hung on both sides of the smooth colorful wall. It seems like you re walking forever then you reach the door of the infamous
dining room.
You re first greeted by the fall wide almond color and trimmed in gold door. The doorknob is always cold to touch like
you re touching a block of ice. When you walk into the door the room is so cold, it feels like you re standing outside in a snow

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>A descriptive paragraph provides a vibrant experience for the reader through vivid language and descriptions of something. Unlike narrative paragraphs, which must include personal thoughts, feelings, and growth, descriptive paragraphs do not need to be personal in nature. Instead, descriptive paragraphs must focus on vividly and objectively describing something to the reader. In order to provide this vivid detail, the writer must use language that appeals to the reader’s five senses: sight, smell, sound, taste, and touch. To appeal to these senses, the writer must use descriptive language, usually in the form of adjectives, that describes the sensations felt by the senses. For instance, examine the differences between the descriptions below:Sentence 1: The tree was tall and green.Sentence 2: The soft and damp pink flowers of the dogwood tree smelled sweet in the cool spring air as the wind whistled through its yellow-green leaves.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Pa </strong><strong>brainliest </strong><strong>plss </strong></p><p><strong>na </strong><strong>banned </strong><strong>po </strong><strong>kasi acc </strong><strong>ko</strong></p><br />
