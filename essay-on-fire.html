                            5. essay explain briefly what are the advantage of solid fuel waste fired portable mechanical dryer​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Low Running Costs:</strong> Burning solid fuels can often be cheaper than traditional gas/electricity depending on your fuel of choice. Many kinds of coal are incredibly inexpensive – especially when you purchase in bulk. Many coal merchants will even offer a summer sale, so there are even more savings to be had when you buy in advance.</p><p><strong>Increased Ventilation</strong>: If your home features a solid fuel appliance, chances are it will be better ventilated than one without. The use of a chimney requires efficient ventilation so fresh air can feed the fire and remove smoke emitted from below. A well-ventilated home will also aid in keeping you cool in the winter.</p><p><strong>Easy &amp; Convenient</strong>: Lighting a fire is a very basic skill that can be learned by anyone! With some kindling &amp; a firelighter you will have a fire roaring in no time. Many modern appliances even come equipped with temperature control tools by adjusting the air flow within the chamber, so you can always find the perfect temperature for you.</p><p><strong>More Reliable:</strong> This advantage may be one of the most overlooked, however it is one of the greatest advantages to burning solid fuels vs other forms of heating. In the event of an emergency such a natural disaster, power lines can break, gas lines can run empty and effected homes can essentially become cut off from the grid. With solid fuels, you don’t rely on any such system as your heating is completely independent and more reliable. As long as there is sufficient oxygen and an ignition – your solid fuel will always produce a flame for warmth.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps.</p><p></p><br />

Fire drills should be conducted in homes as well as in schools and other public buildings First of all, having regular fire drills at home would allow all family members to practice what to do in an emergency. This practice would reduce panic during a fire and perhaps make the difference between escaping safely and being trapped. Second, having home fire drills would set a good example in the neighborhood. Nearby families may be encouraged to have their own drills. Most important having fire drills at home would probably lead people to be more safety conscious so that fires would not get started in the first place A few minutes, a few times a year can help save lives.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Essentially all four elements must be present for fire to occur, fuel, heat, oxygen, and a chemical chain reaction. Removal of any one of these essential elements will result in the fire being extinguished.The combustion process or fire is sometimes called rapid oxidation. It is similar to the formation of rust on iron or the decay of dead wood in the forest, except that the process is drastically speeded up. These stages are incipient, growth, fully developed, and decay. Compartment fire development can be described as being comprised of four stages: incipient, growth, fully developed and decay. Whatever the type of scene, a firefighter offers basic first aid and care. For example, he might perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or comfort and reassure an injured person until an ambulance arrives. If he has EMT or paramedic certification, he provides additional basic and advanced emergency treatment. </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>MY OWN EXPLANATION TAKES ME 30 MINUTES </p><p>One by one( learning) </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Fire safety and prevention are critical aspects of our daily lives. Fire outbreaks can occur at any time and place, and they can result in significant loss of lives and property. Therefore, it is essential to understand the measures we can take to prevent fires and protect ourselves in the event of a fire outbreak.</p><p></p><p>One of the primary ways to prevent fire outbreaks is to ensure that we have functioning smoke detectors in our homes and offices. Smoke detectors can alert us early enough, giving us time to evacuate before the fire spreads. We should also ensure that the detectors have fresh batteries and are tested regularly to ensure that they are functioning correctly.</p><p></p><p>Another important measure for fire prevention is to ensure that all electrical appliances and equipment are used correctly and in line with the manufacturer's guidelines. Overloading sockets and using faulty appliances can cause fires. It is essential to unplug electrical devices when they are not in use and switch off lights when leaving a room.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, we must be careful with flammable materials such as cooking oils, gasoline, and chemicals. These materials should be stored away from heat sources and in well-ventilated areas. It is crucial to follow the manufacturer's instructions when handling flammable materials and to use them in a well-ventilated area.</p><p></p><p>In the event of a fire outbreak, it is critical to remain calm and follow established fire safety procedures. This includes evacuating the building immediately and using fire exits and stairways. People should not use elevators during a fire outbreak, as they can malfunction and trap individuals inside.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, fire safety and prevention are crucial aspects of our daily lives. We must take steps to prevent fires from occurring and to protect ourselves and others in the event of a fire outbreak. This includes installing functioning smoke detectors, using electrical appliances and equipment correctly, being careful with flammable materials, and following established fire safety procedures during an outbreak. By taking these measures, we can reduce the risk of fires and protect ourselves and our properties.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Fire Safety and Prevention</p><p></p><p>Fire is a dangerous and destructive force that can cause significant damage to property and can even result in loss of life. It is essential to take preventative measures to ensure that fire incidents are avoided, and in the event of an outbreak, proper fire safety protocols are followed to minimize the risk of harm to people and property. In this essay, we will discuss the importance of fire safety and prevention, and the measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of fires.</p><p></p><p>Fire prevention is the first step towards ensuring fire safety. It involves taking measures to prevent the outbreak of fires by identifying potential fire hazards and taking steps to eliminate them. Some of the common causes of fires include electrical faults, open flames, cooking equipment, smoking, and heating appliances. By being aware of these potential fire hazards, people can take steps to eliminate them and reduce the risk of fires.</p><p></p><p>It is also essential to have the necessary fire safety equipment in place to help prevent the outbreak of fires. Smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and fire alarms are just a few examples of equipment that can be used to help prevent fires. Smoke detectors can detect the presence of smoke in the air and alert people to the presence of a fire. Fire extinguishers can be used to put out small fires before they escalate, while fire alarms can alert people to the presence of a fire and help them evacuate the building.</p><p></p><p>In addition to fire prevention, it is important to have a fire safety plan in place. This plan should outline the steps that should be taken in the event of a fire, including how to evacuate the building and how to contact the fire department. It is important to practice the fire safety plan regularly to ensure that everyone is familiar with the procedures and can act quickly in the event of a fire.</p><p></p><p>Education is also an essential part of fire safety and prevention. People should be educated on the potential fire hazards in their homes and workplaces and the steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of fires. Schools and workplaces should conduct regular fire drills to ensure that everyone knows what to do in the event of a fire.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, fire safety and prevention are essential to ensure the safety of people and property. By taking preventative measures, having the necessary fire safety equipment in place, having a fire safety plan, and educating people on fire safety, we can reduce the risk of fires and minimize the potential for harm. It is important to take these measures seriously and to make them a part of our daily routine to ensure that we are prepared in the event of a fire.</p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>An avalanche (also called a snowslide) is an event that occurs when a cohesive slab of snow lying upon a weaker layer of snow fractures and slides down a steep slope. Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical failure in the snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces of the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradual widening (loose snow avalanche). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they entrain more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough, some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which is a type of gravity current.
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>Slides of rocks or debris, behaving in a similar way to snow, are also referred to as avalanches (see rockslide[1]). The remainder of this article refers to snow avalanches, because they are the ones that occur the most in the world.</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>A wildfire, wildland fire or rural fire is an unplanned, unwanted, uncontrolled fire in an area of combustible vegetation starting in rural areas and urban areas.[1] Depending on the type of vegetation present, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a forest fire, brush fire, bushfire (in Australia), desert fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, prairie fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire.[2] Many organizations consider wildfire to mean an unplanned and unwanted fire,[3] while wildland-fire is a broader term that includes prescribed fire as well as wildland fire use (WFU; these are also called monitored response fires).[3][4]
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago.[5] The occurrence of wildfires throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.[6] Earth is an intrinsically flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation, seasonally dry climates, atmospheric oxygen, and widespread lightning and volcanic ignitions.[6]</strong><p></p><br />
