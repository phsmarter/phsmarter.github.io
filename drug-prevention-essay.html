I chose drugs that impact me a lot. It’s a sad fact that drugs are being abused among people not only in our country but also it is practiced by others especially the teenagers in our generation maybe because the lack of attention of parents to children or the friends were bad influence, but I believe it’s not excuse to be involved in such a situation like this.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Prevention of drug and alcohol abuse can start at home. Parents can talk to their children and explain the consequences of drug and alcohol abuse. Specifically talking to children while they are young can create a strong foundation for awareness of drug use. This helps parents positively influence their children, while teaching their children about boundaries.</p><p></p><p>In teaching boundaries, parents help children to understand when to deny something that can hurt them, while controlling the dynamic of an unhealthy request. Prevention talks also create deeper bonds and guidance between children and parents. Parents can establish consistency in communication, as well as guidance that can be followed for years. Preventative conversations can lead the adolescent to strengthen trust with their parent, and make wise decisions with habits, friends, interests, and influences. With a family protection. </p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Drugs are nothing but certain substances that make you addicted to them and change your lifestyle. The change that comes within your lifestyle is mostly negative. It is known to alter reality in such a way that you forget your roots and become prone to succumbing to your bad habits. The main change comes into your mental and physical wellbeing. This gives way to financial problems and negative effects on family and even professional relationships.</p><p></p><p>Drugs are not to be taken lightly as a problem. They are something that is often taken lightly and are taken within but is soon found to be irreparable mistakes. Drug use is mostly opted for when you are trying to cope up in a situation where you are emotionally tired and you feel that taking drugs would free you of the pain. This is the reason why most of the young generation falls prey to this demon.</p><p></p><p>Drug abuse is the most problematic cause of death in the world. Around 350,000 die from overdoses of smoking, drugs, and drinking as well. It is high time that we understand the seriousness of drug abuse and stay as far as possible from it.</p><br />

                        <p></p><p></p><p>Dug Abuse Essay</p><p></p><p>A drug is a substance which may have medicinal, intoxicating, performance enhancing or other effects when taken or put into a human body or the body of another animal and is not considered a food or exclusively a food. I chose drugs that impact me a lot. It’s a sad fact that drugs are being abused among people not only in our country but also it is practiced by others especially the teenagers in our generation maybe because the lack of attention of parents to children or the friends were bad influence, but I believe it’s not excuse to be involved in such a situation like this.</p><p></p><p>Prevention Of Drug Abuse In Schools Essay</p><p></p><p>It is the choice of an individual whether he/she will be influenced by or follow what others do to make their lives miserable. Drug abuse is what I would consider a pretty severe problem we have here in the Philippines. There are many different types of drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, and heroine to just list a few. These drugs are all fairly simple to produce.</p><p></p><p>Teenage drug abuse</p><p></p><p>Teenagers use drugs because they want to fit in. No one wants to be the only one not participating. No one wants to be left out.</p><p>So sometimes they make bad decisions, like taking drugs, to cover-up their insecurities. * Because they want to escape or relax. * Because they think it makes them seem grown-up. * Because they want to rebel. Sometimes people turn to drugs not so much for themselves, but to make a statement against someone else, such as their families or society in general. * Because they are curious. Adolescents are curious about having new experiences. Seeing someone doing drugs makes them more curious to know how drugs will make them feel.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ways to prevent drug abuse</p><p></p><p>The reasons above should never be an excuse to abuse ourselves. While it’s practically impossible to prevent anyone and everyone from using drugs, there are things we can all do to avoid drug and/or alcohol abuse. By sharing this knowledge with those closest to you, you yourself may be able to prevent them from doing drugs, too. Good communication with all family members, especially with our parents would be one of the effective ways for us not to sort on taking drugs when it comes to dealing with our problems.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Education and counselling:</p><p></p><p></p><p>Education and counselling are very important to face problems, stresses, disappointments and failure in life. These should be taken as part of life. One should utilize a child’s energy in some other activities like sports, music, reading, yoga and other extra curricular activities.</p><p>3. Seeking help from parents and peers:</p><p>Whenever, there is any problem, one should seek help and a guidance from parents and peers. Help should be taken from close and trusted friends. This would help young to share their feelings of anxiety and wrong doings.</p><p>4. Looking for Danger Signs:</p><p>If friends find someone using drugs or alcohol, they should bring this to the notice of parents of teacher so that appropriate measures would be taken to diagnose the illness and the causes.

Seeking Professional and Medical helps:</p><p>Highly qualified psychologists, psychia­trists and de-addiction and rehabilitation programmes can help individuals who are suffering from drug/alcohol abuse. If such help is provided to the affected persons, with sufficient efforts and will power, the patient could be completely cured and lead normal and healthy life.</p><p></p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It has been discovered that most people who struggle with drug addiction began experimenting with drugs in their teens.  Teenage drug abuse is one of the largest problems in society today and the problem grows and larger every year.  Drugs are a pervasive force in our culture today.  To expect kids not to be influenced by the culture of their time is as unrealistic as believing in the tooth fairy (Bauman 140).  Teens may feel pressured by their friends to try drugs, they may have easy access to drugs, they may use drugs to rebel against their family or society, or they may take an illegal drug because they are curious about it or the pleasure that it gives them. After interviewing my teenage cousin whom has been in several altercations.</p><p>My teenage cousin advised me that after she passed the stage of being pressured by her peers to use drugs and alcohol, she began using it to make her feel better because she was suffering from depression.  Depression is the result of chemical imbalance and environmental influence.  Drugs and alcohol are the most readily available methods of emotional anesthesia, if not on hand; they would find a substitute (Henican 141).  She would use drugs when she would think about her incarcerated dad that has been in and out of her life from birth.  Her family members would try to encourage her and would often tell her, “If you continue to do the things that you are doing, you will end up like your dad incarcerated.”  She rebels against her mother and stepfather when they try to correct her and discipline her.  She doesn’t like to follow the rules at home or school and acts like she doesn’t do anything wrong.  Something psychologically is really going on with her mentally, that is one of the side effects that drugs causes.  Seeing there is no way out feeling lonely like no one cares and no prospects for improvement leads to depression.  Depression is something that many teens deal with during their lives.</p><p></p><br />
