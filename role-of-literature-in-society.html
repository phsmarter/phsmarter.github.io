In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</a>

These features include not only grammar and syntax but also literary devices such as meter and figures of speech. 2.

The focus is to describe how social class, economy, money and power play a role in literary selections. The social class strugples in literature reflect how the low class are being dominated by the upper class in the society. The critic will dig into how the dominant groups exploit the minority groups in a text and how to redeem the status of said minority groups. 4. In this approach, the critic will look into how literature treats women such as their roles, images, portrayals, character, and chajacterization. It aims to uplift the women's status from a discriminated or silenced one into women who are equal with men. Its intention is not to overcome the men but both to have harmony and collaboration. 5. This approach in literary criticism perceives that each literary work is a product of its time and its world. It investigates how a tex: manifests the attitudes, beliefs, ideas and culture of the period it was created. In doing this, the reader or critic will look int the background of a story or a poem in order that he or she will understand the text better.
