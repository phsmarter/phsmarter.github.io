"Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 3. The PISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country is 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers, as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the PISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</a>

                                            Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. questions:1. What do you think is the stand of the author? Is s/he for or against the implementation of SHS? Justify your answer. 2. What is the central claim of the text? 3. Who do you think is the target reader of the text? Why? 4. What was currently happening when the text was written? What prompted the author to write the text? 5. Do you think there is sufficient and valid evidence against and for SHS? Justify your answer. 6. Based on your own experience, should SHS continue to be implemented?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The education of a society plays a crucial role in dictating the future and identity of the country as this valuable acquisition of knowledge has a great impact in the national development and stability of the economy. The provision of quality education and an ambient learning environment encourages the Filipino people to nurture and enhance their knowledge, potentials, and creativity. By providing quality education to the Filipino youth, we are enabling the youth of the nation to grow into globally competitive professionals, thus, offering the country with a better quality of living. </p><p></p><p>Before the Philippines broke away from their rule under Spain and the United States, their educational system was arranged according to their colonial powers.

Thus, the Department of Education or DepEd has incorporated media and technology skills, learning and innovation skills, effective communication skills, and life and career skills. Through this system, the Cebu City National Science High School shall be able to incorporate the new curriculum to the institution’s design and planning.  Unfortunately, the current facilities of the educational institution are not able to accommodate to the updated K to 12 program as more classrooms, laboratories, and ancillary rooms are related.</p><p>We should partake in things that we believe in and things that will contribute to our success. However, public education prepares you to become something you are not and grow out of your creativity. It gives you the false hope that what you have desire to become is something else because you were not taught in a way to prepare for you to exhibit yourself into the world. There are many things that is learned in school, but is soon realized on how eventually we can not use these life lessons in our lives. For example, a person who wants to be a musician is forced to intensely focus on science, math and English when it does not correspond to the musical field.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Nonetheless, the integration of media technologies in education has opened up new possibilities and opportunities for learning in the Philippines.<br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The 19th century was an unusually fertile period of thought. The ideas of evolution, progress, liberty, radical encounter with God, the struggle for existence, human control over human destiny, and universal caring were invented or substantially developed during this time.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the 19th century, the philosophers of the 18th-century Enlightenment began to have a dramatic effect on subsequent developments in philosophy. In particular, the works of Immanuel Kant gave rise to a new generation of German philosophers and began to see wider recognition internationally. Also, in a reaction to the Enlightenment, a movement called Romanticism began to develop towards the end of the 18th century. Key ideas that sparked changes in philosophy were the fast progress of science, including evolution, most notably postulated by Charles Darwin and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, and theories regarding what is today called emergent order, such as the free market of Adam Smith within nation states. Pressures for egalitarianism, and more rapid change culminated in a period of revolution and turbulence that would see philosophy change as well.</p><br />

                        The Philippine’s education system is managed by the Philippine department of education. It controls the general running of schools and colleges in the Philippines and controls the curriculum in the Philippine’s education system. It also details things such as how teachers are to be hired and what qualifications they should have. My sequence essay is based on the education of a person born in the Philippines. The country achieved independence in 1946, so before that time it was colonial powers that regulated education. Those colonial powers came from the USA and Spain. The education system changed radically since the country achieved independence. There are six years of compulsory elementary education. This starts at around the age of six and goes up to the age of 12. The date that classes start is the same across the country, though some holidays do vary. Still, the curriculum must start in all schools at the same time. This is probably because it means any exams happen at the same time across the country.<br />As a young person, you are required to start school at the age of six and keep working until you reach the age of 12. At that age, you may be able to stay at your current school for your High School education, or you may have to move to another school to get your High School education.<br /><br /><br />

"Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 3. The PISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country is 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers, as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the PISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</h2><br />

                            26. Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. questions:1. What do you think is the stand of the author? Is s/he for or against the implementation of SHS? Justify your answer. 2. What is the central claim of the text? 3. Who do you think is the target reader of the text? Why? 4. What was currently happening when the text was written? What prompted the author to write the text? 5. Do you think there is sufficient and valid evidence against and for SHS? Justify your answer. 6. Based on your own experience, should SHS continue to be implemented?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. The author's stand on the implementation of SHS is not clear from the given text. While the author presents both the commendable intention and the concerns of critics, the text does not explicitly state whether the author is for or against the implementation of SHS.</strong></p><p><strong>2. The central claim of the text is that the implementation of the K to 12 Program in the Philippines, particularly the addition of two years of Senior High School (SHS), has both positive and negative effects on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>3. The target reader of the text is likely to be educators, policymakers, and the general public who are interested in the current state of education in the Philippines and the effects of the K to 12 Program on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>4. When the text was written, the implementation of the K to 12 Program, which adds two years of Senior High School (SHS) to the Philippines' educational system, was ongoing. The author discusses the program's aim, which includes providing students with more time to master concepts and skills, preparing them for higher education and middle-level skills development, and producing lifelong learners. The author also highlights some concerns and criticisms of the program, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, and the potential loss of revenues for colleges and universities. The author also notes that while some people criticize the implementation of SHS, others praise it, indicating that it is a controversial issue that has elicited different reactions from various stakeholders. The text aims to provide information about the implementation of the K to 12 Program and to present different perspectives on its effectiveness and impact.</strong></p><p><strong>5. The text presents both the positive and negative effects of the implementation of SHS. There are valid concerns raised by critics, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, as well as the potential revenue loss of colleges and universities. However, the DepEd is optimistic that these problems will be addressed, and some private educational associations commend the implementation of the K to 12 Program. Therefore, there is evidence both for and against SHS, and it is up to policymakers and stakeholders to carefully weigh these factors when making decisions about education reform.<br />6. The effectiveness of the implementation of SHS in the Philippines is a matter of ongoing debate, and opinions may vary depending on various factors, such as personal experiences, beliefs, and the current state of education in the country. Some people may argue that the additional two years of education provide students with more time to develop their skills and prepare for their future careers. On the other hand, others may argue that it is too long and puts a strain on students and their families, especially those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Based on my knowledge, I cannot make a definitive statement on whether SHS should continue to be implemented or not. However, it is essential to evaluate the implementation of SHS continually, monitor its effects, and address any issues that may arise to ensure that it benefits its stakeholders and achieves its intended goals.</strong></p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>In the 19th century, the philosophers of the 18th-century Enlightenment began to have a dramatic effect on subsequent developments in philosophy. In particular, the works of Immanuel Kant gave rise to a new generation of German philosophers and began to see wider recognition internationally. Also, in a reaction to the Enlightenment, a movement called Romanticism began to develop towards the end of the 18th century. Key ideas that sparked changes in philosophy were the fast progress of science, including evolution, most notably postulated by Charles Darwin and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, and theories regarding what is today called emergent order, such as the free market of Adam Smith within nation states. Pressures for egalitarianism, and more rapid change culminated in a period of revolution and turbulence that would see philosophy change as well.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Sana makatulong </p><br />
