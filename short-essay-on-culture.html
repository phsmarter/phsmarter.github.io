                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>So in short, music has the power to culturally, morally, and emotionally influence our society. Thus, the more intentional we become with the sounds, messages, and moods we create and release through our music, the more powerful we will become in making deep positive impacts.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>As musicians, we are carriers of influence, whether or not we are aware of it and whether or not we intend to be. The sound and messages we release through our art form directly impact our listeners in powerful ways. This is especially true of the youth and adolescents of our society, who are still extremely malleable to the world around them. I remember sitting in the car with my two little cousins, ages five and eight, when "Get Lucky" by Daft Punk came on the radio. They both started singing every word at the top of their lungs. And when Katy Perry sang during the Super Bowl halftime show, the kids at the party sang nearly every lyric verbatim, putting me to shame because I didn't know all the lyrics, and I'm aspiring to be a pop artist. It began to shock me just how acutely youth are being impacted by the music they listened to, and how much attention they're paying to the music being played around them.</p><br />

                        <p>Many centuries ago, art was rendered inaccessible by the masses and was reserved for the few high society members who had the means of access to appreciate history in the making. Through the use of technology, art has been made hugely accessible by the ability to trade media forms, mainly through the Internet and other technological means. Much like the printing press was for literature with Gutenberg in 1445, technology has heightened art and moreover, the expression of it.</p><p></p><p>Hope it helpss</p><p></p><p>Please follow!! arigathanksss!!</p><p></p><p><strong>#CARRYONLEARNING</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Music plays a crucial role in the life and culture of Mindanao, a region located in the southern part of the Philippines. The diversity of the island's indigenous groups and the rich cultural heritage of its Muslim and Christian populations have created a unique musical landscape that is both vibrant and complex.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One of the most important functions of music in Mindanao is its ability to express and preserve the stories, traditions, and values of different communities. Traditional music, such as the "kulintang" and "agung," are often played during rituals, celebrations, and social gatherings, serving as a way for people to connect with their heritage and ancestors. Many of these musical traditions have been passed down from generation to generation and are considered an integral part of the region's cultural identity.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Music also serves as a means of communication in Mindanao, particularly among the indigenous groups who have developed intricate systems of vocal and instrumental music to convey messages and express emotions. For example, the T'boli people of South Cotabato use a type of music called "hegalong" to communicate with spirits during their ceremonies. Similarly, the Manobo people of Bukidnon use their "kudyapi" instrument to express their love, sorrow, and joy.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Beyond its cultural significance, music in Mindanao has also played a critical role in social and political movements. During the Marcos dictatorship, for example, musicians used their music as a form of protest against the oppressive regime. The song "Bayan Ko" became an anthem for democracy and freedom, inspiring Filipinos to fight for their rights.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, the importance of music in Mindanao cannot be overstated. It serves as a vessel for cultural expression and communication, a tool for preserving traditions and values, and a catalyst for social change. As the region continues to evolve and face new challenges, music will undoubtedly continue to play a vital role in shaping its identity and future.<br /></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>HAVE A GOOD DAY KIDDO:))<br />

Many people have contributed to the advancement of technology over the years. However, some people think that technological advances will destroy our society as well as nature. They believe that this new technology should be banned because it could cause many problems such as pollution, war, and destruction of natural resources. Some countries even ban certain types of technologies or limit how much technology their citizens use so they don't get too dependent on them. For example, there are places where electricity is only provided during daylight hours. There are also places where cell phones aren’t allowed at night. Other countries try to protect themselves from these negative effects through regulation. If an invention doesn't harm anyone else then its okay to let it happen but if it does harm others then it shouldn't occur. This way everyone's rights are protected.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Philippines, a country home to many food and agricultural staples. It has more than seven thousand islands attracting tourists from all over the world. These islands are rich in local delicacies and wide varieties in the different styles of street food. From these originates a unique food called Balut which is an unusual delicacy made here in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>Balut is a chicken or duck egg which is half boiled and then eaten directly from the shell. It is commonly sold as a street food in The Philippines; you can often see it being sold in the streets across the country.</p><p></p><p>Balut is a sixteen to twenty-one day old fertilised egg of a duck or chicken. The egg is then boiled with not only the yolk present inside but also the embryo.</p><p></p><p>It is considered to be one of The Philippines most famous and iconic delicacies and is eaten by cracking open the shell and having it with a bit of salt and vinegar. Some tourists like the idea of trying something new which makes this an attractive delicacy. Others are revolted by the idea of eating the fetus of a chicken.</p><p></p><p>So, where did this exotic food come from? </p><p>Balut originated in the Philippines in the early 1900’s. The Philippine people were influenced by the Chinese presence back in 1885. Since then they have been preparing and eating Balut as an exotic dish.</p><p></p><p>With the large migration of FIlipinos has come the rise in demand for Balut across the globe. You can now easily find Balut across many major western nations by simply paying a visit to a local FIlipino supermarket.</p><p></p><p>Balut holds a particular cultural importance in Philippine history. It has been discovered that the concept of eating fertilised duck eggs began in the 17th century – due to influence from the Chinese, Thai, and Laotians.</p><p></p><p>A lot of socio-cultural factors dominate Balut market. These factors are different from the nutritional values. as it is a good source of protein and calcium. But that is not the primary reason why it is loved by FIlipinos.</p><p></p><p>So what is the appeal of Balut?</p><p></p><p>It is simply a delicious affordable snack.
