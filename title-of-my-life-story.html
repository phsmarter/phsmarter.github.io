                                            One peaceful night, he dreamed of a monster named Covido. It was a virus that could harm a person whom he touched and talked with. "Oh, please don't come near me. I promise I will be a good child and I will obey my parents." Dodong was trembling and crying out of nervousness. He was searching for the alcohol to let the monster away from him. Unluckily, he could not find the alcohol or sanitizer. Covido was coming near him trying to reach and hug him. Suddenly, when Dodong opened his eyes and wiped his sweat in his forehead, he just realized that he was just dreaming. This time, he did the sign of the cross and prayed. He thanked God for keeping him and his family safe during this pandemic. Then, he promised that he will follow his parent's advice in observing and following the protocol to stop the spreading of COVID 19. Let us answer the questions, if you truly understood the story. 1. What is the title of the story you have read? Dodong's Dream 2. Who are the characters in the story? Dodong, and couido 3. Do you really think that the story happens in real life? Why/ why not?

The Story of My Life by Helen Keller Excerpt from Chapter IV Autobiography The most important day I remember in all my life is the one on which my teacher, Anne Mansfield Sullivan, came to me. I am filled with wonder when I consider the immeasurable contrasts between the two lives which it connects. One day, while I was playing with my new doll, Miss Sullivan put my big rag doll into my lap also, spell ed "d-o-l-l" and tried to make me understand that "d-o-1-l" applied to both. Miss Sullivan had tried to impress it upon me that "m-ug" is mug and that "w-a-t-e-r" is water, but I persisted in confounding the two. I learned a great many new words that day. I do not remember what they all were; but I do know that mother, father, sister, teacher were among them-words that were to make the world blossom for me. Title of the Story: 1.

LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.
QUESTION:

The Story of My Life by Helen Keller Excerpt from Chapter IV Autobiography The most important day I remember in all my life is the one on which my teacher, Anne Mansfield Sullivan, came to me. I am filled with wonder when I consider the immeasurable contrasts between the two lives which it connects. One day, while I was playing with my new doll, Miss Sullivan put my big rag doll into my lap also, spell ed "d-o-l-1" and tried to make me understand that "d-o-i-l" applied to both. Miss Sullivan had tried to impress it upon me that "m-ug" is mug and that "w-a-t-e-r" is water, but I persisted in confounding the two. I learned a great many new words that day. I do not remember what they all were; but I do know that mother, father, sister, teacher were among them-words that were to make the world blossom for me. 1.

LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

Take this example from Oscar Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest:</p><p></p><p>ALGERNON: Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?</p><p>LANE: I didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.</p><p>ALGERNON: I’m sorry for that, for your sake. I don’t play accurately—anyone can play accurately—but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.</p><p>LANE: Yes, sir.</p><p>ALGERNON: And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?</p><br />

                        ➬ Laughter is the best medicine. Title - LAUGHTERIntroduction - Laughter is a powerful medicine. It attracts people in ways that cause healthy physical and emotional changes in the body. Laughter boosts your immune system, improves your mood, reduces pain, and protects you from the negative effects of stress.(Optional if you want the introduction to be longer) Nothing works faster or more consistently to restore balance to your mind and body than a good laugh. Humor lifts your spirits, gives you hope, connects you to others, and keeps you grounded, focused, and alert. It also aids in the release of anger and the forgiveness of others. Body - We used to laugh hundreds of times a day as children, but as adults, life becomes more serious and laughter becomes less frequent. However, by actively seeking out opportunities for humor and laughter, you can improve your emotional health, strengthen your relationships, find greater happiness, and even add years to your life. Conclusion - Nothing dispels rage and conflict like a good laugh. Looking for the humorous side of things can help you put problems into perspective and move on from confrontations without harboring bitterness or resentment.#Goodluck <p></p><br />

The Story of My Life by Helen Keller Excerpt from Chapter IV Autobiography The most important day I remember in all my life is the one on which my teacher, Anne Mansfield Sullivan, came to me. I am filled with wonder when I consider the immeasurable contrasts between the two lives which it connects. One day, while I was playing with my new doll, Miss Sullivan put my big rag doll into my lap also, spell ed "d-o-l-1" and tried to make me understand that "d-o-i-l" applied to both. Miss Sullivan had tried to impress it upon me that "m-ug" is mug and that "w-a-t-e-r" is water, but I persisted in confounding the two. I learned a great many new words that day. I do not remember what they all were; but I do know that mother, father, sister, teacher were among them-words that were to make the world blossom for me. 1.
