Teenage Pregnancy in the Philippines The issue of teenage pregnancy is widespread in various parts of the country. Today, we face the painful reality that at a very young age, young people have children of their own. During the World Population Day Forum held in Quezon City last July 2019, the Commission on Population (Popcom) raised concerns about early and unplanned pregnancies by citing that around 500 teenage girls have given birth in the country every day as more adolescents engage in premarital sex. Popcom said some 196,000 Filipinos between the ages of 15 and 19 years old get pregnant each year. In the Philippines, according to the 2013 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) and the 2013 Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality Study (YAFSS), the number of women aged 15-19 who have begun childbearing increased from eight percent in 2003 to 10 percent in 2013.</a>

Coronavirus disease commonly called COVID-19 is an infectious
disease which originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In the
Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) reported the first case of
COVID-19 with a 38-year-old female Chinese national. Most people who are 
positive with the virus experienced cough, fever, shortness of breath, and pneumonia. Unfortunately, if a person is asymptomatic there are no symptoms. But infection can be prevented by washing our hands or using disinfectant like alcohol and not touching the face. Many people around the world died because of this virus. So, the best thing that we can do is to follow the safety protocols, to pray, and to protect ourselves from COVID-19.

It would be in the best interest of the country if President Marcos appoints a “permanent” Department of Health secretary, especially since the World Health Organization warned of the emergence of new, deadlier variants of the COVID-19 virus, according to a congressman. “A permanent DOH chief is needed to lead the country in the race for world-class health care,” House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan said, noting that Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire was just designated as “officer-in-charge.”The leader of the 28-member official opposition bloc in the House of Representatives also observed that it has been nearly six months since Marcos took over the reins of power in June 30, but that he has “not nominated” any health secretary yet. The DOH portfolio is very important, even as Libanan prefers that national government “quickly modernize the country’s health care system, and position the Philippines as a global medical hub just like Singapore.”“We should aspire to be like Singapore, which receives more than 160,000 foreign patients who undergo over 70 kinds of medical treatments or procedures every year,” the congressman from party-list 4Ps said. “In fact, a growing number of wealthy Filipinos are already flying to Singapore just to seek medical treatment,” Libanan pointed out. The House leader believes the “Philippines has all the assets needed – including highly trained physicians, nurses, medical technologists and pharmacists – to advance as an international medical center for foreign patients looking for world-class health care.” “In fact, Filipino health care professionals are also admired around the world as the most caring. We have to capitalize on this,” Libanan stressed. “This is not just about medical tourism. This is also about providing every Filipino, rich or poor, access to world-class medical treatment services through our public health system,” he said. At the same time, Libanan called for effective public-private partnerships to put the Philippines at the forefront of medical developments. “We must also develop complimentary medical research and education capacities through international collaborations,” he proposed. “If necessary, Congress should provide tax incentives to lure new international medical schools and research facilities to operate here.”Libanan likewise pressed for a multi-year program to simultaneously modernize the UP-Philippine General Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, and the Lung Center of the Philippines, among others.​</a>

Years had passed, but no ark was made. Disappointed, God called Noah for an explanation,Noah trembled before God and explained why the project had been derailed.First, he confirmed that the Mayor would only give him the permit if his nephew's construction company wouldbuild it. Second, the congressman wanted 30% of the price as his commission. Third, the workers contractedformed a union and went on strike for higher pay. Fourth, all of a sudden, the left-leaning groups protestedthe selective inclusion of the people in the ark, especially the male and the female designations, which wereoffensive to the gays and lesbians. Fifth, the Senate had a hearing in aid of legislation and summoned Noahfor a lengthy inquisition because he could not invoke executive privilege and confidentiality. Sixth, the Senateruled that it violated the separation of Church and State. Finally, the President of the Republic of thePhilippines would only allow it if a tarpaulin would be made to shou that it was his project, "Towards a StrongRepublic', and so Temporary Restraining Order was issued on the project. With these, God desperatelyconcluded that he didn't have to send a flood to destroy this nation for "THIS NATION IS ALREADYENGAGED IN SELF-DESTRUCTION!"PA tulong nmn po Summary mo yan​</a>

The Philippines had an average reading score of 340, more than 200 points below China (555) and more than 100 points less than the OECD average (487).In the Philippines, boys’ and girls’ performances in reading both ranked lowest among PISA-participating countries.“Reading proficiency is essential for a wide variety of human activities - from following instructions in a manual; to finding out the who, what, when, where, and why of an event; to communicating with others for a specific purpose or transaction,” the summary of the PISA 2018 results reads.The Philippines also placed the second-lowest in mathematics (353), along with Panama, and science (357). Only the Dominican Republic scored lower in these categories.China also led the ranking in mathematics and science. The OECD average for mathematics is 489 and the average for science is 483.“Results from PISA indicate the quality and equity of learning outcomes attained around the world, and allow educators and policymakers to learn from the policies and practices applied in other countries,” a post on the OECD website reads.According to the PISA 2018 profile of the Philippines, socio-economic status accounts for 18% of the variance in reading performance in the country, compared to the OECD average of 12%.The country has the largest percentage of low performers in reading among socio-economically disadvantaged students.The profile noted that average class sizes of 15-year olds in the Philippines are the largest, and the ratio of students to teaching staff in socio-economically disadvantaged schools is the highest.The Philippines also had the highest percentage of students reporting being bullied at least a few times a month.Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they did not expect high marks based on National Achievement Test results, according to a report by The STAR.Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they were not expecting high marks for the Philippines, noting the results of the National Achievement Test which showed low proficiency levels in Science, Math and English​</a>

In the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) reported the first case of COVID-19 with a 38- year-old female Chinese national.

                            5. Make a summary about the topic below and explain why it belongs to that type of qualitative research. 
Teenage Pregnancy in the Philippines The issue of teenage pregnancy is widespread in various parts of the country. Today, we face the painful reality that at a very young age, young people have children of their own. During the World Population Day Forum held in Quezon City last July 2019, the Commission on Population (Popcom) raised concerns about early and unplanned pregnancies by citing that around 500 teenage girls have given birth in the country every day as more adolescents engage in premarital sex. Popcom said some 196,000 Filipinos between the ages of 15 and 19 years old get pregnant each year. In the Philippines, according to the 2013 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) and the 2013 Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality Study (YAFSS), the number of women aged 15-19 who have begun childbearing increased from eight percent in 2003 to 10 percent in 2013.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Teenage pregnancy, also known as adolescent pregnancy, is pregnancy in a female under the age of 20, according to the WHO. Pregnancy can occur with sexual intercourse after the start of ovulation, which can be before the first menstrual period (menarche) but usually occurs after the onset of periods. The main objective of the research was to explore how young women responded to finding out they were pregnant, who they talked to, who supported them, and how their behaviours were influenced by local services, including access to sex education and contraception advice.</p><br />

Coronavirus disease commonly called COVID-19 is an infectious
disease which originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In the
Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) reported the first case of
COVID-19 with a 38-year-old female Chinese national. Most people who are 
positive with the virus experienced cough, fever, shortness of breath, and pneumonia. Unfortunately, if a person is asymptomatic there are no symptoms. But infection can be prevented by washing our hands or using disinfectant like alcohol and not touching the face. Many people around the world died because of this virus. So, the best thing that we can do is to follow the safety protocols, to pray, and to protect ourselves from COVID-19.

                            8. Coronavirus disease commonly called COVID-19 is an infectious disease which originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) reported the first case of COVID-19 with a 38-year-old female Chinese national. Most people who are positive with the virus experienced cough, fever, shortness of breath, and pneumonia. Unfortunately, if a person is asymptomatic there are no symptoms. But infection can be prevented by washing our hands or using disinfectant like alcohol and not touching the face. Many people around the world died because of this virus. So, the best thing that we can do is to follow the safety protocols, to pray, and to protect ourselves from COVID-19.what is the summary of the passage? ​</h2><br />

It would be in the best interest of the country if President Marcos appoints a “permanent” Department of Health secretary, especially since the World Health Organization warned of the emergence of new, deadlier variants of the COVID-19 virus, according to a congressman. “A permanent DOH chief is needed to lead the country in the race for world-class health care,” House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan said, noting that Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire was just designated as “officer-in-charge.”The leader of the 28-member official opposition bloc in the House of Representatives also observed that it has been nearly six months since Marcos took over the reins of power in June 30, but that he has “not nominated” any health secretary yet. The DOH portfolio is very important, even as Libanan prefers that national government “quickly modernize the country’s health care system, and position the Philippines as a global medical hub just like Singapore.”“We should aspire to be like Singapore, which receives more than 160,000 foreign patients who undergo over 70 kinds of medical treatments or procedures every year,” the congressman from party-list 4Ps said. “In fact, a growing number of wealthy Filipinos are already flying to Singapore just to seek medical treatment,” Libanan pointed out. The House leader believes the “Philippines has all the assets needed – including highly trained physicians, nurses, medical technologists and pharmacists – to advance as an international medical center for foreign patients looking for world-class health care.” “In fact, Filipino health care professionals are also admired around the world as the most caring. We have to capitalize on this,” Libanan stressed. “This is not just about medical tourism. This is also about providing every Filipino, rich or poor, access to world-class medical treatment services through our public health system,” he said. At the same time, Libanan called for effective public-private partnerships to put the Philippines at the forefront of medical developments. “We must also develop complimentary medical research and education capacities through international collaborations,” he proposed. “If necessary, Congress should provide tax incentives to lure new international medical schools and research facilities to operate here.”Libanan likewise pressed for a multi-year program to simultaneously modernize the UP-Philippine General Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, and the Lung Center of the Philippines, among others.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan has urged President Marcos to appoint a permanent Department of Health (DOH) secretary. Libanan believes that this is necessary in order to lead the country in its fight against the COVID-19 virus and its potential new, deadlier variants. He noted that Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire is currently only serving as "officer-in-charge" of the DOH. Libanan also believes that the Philippines has the potential to become a global medical hub like Singapore. He called for effective public-private partnerships and tax incentives to attract international medical schools and research facilities to the country.<p></p><br />

Philippines lowest in reading comprehension reaction paperPhilippines lowest in reading comprehension among 79 countriesBy Ratziel San Juan (Philstar.com) - December 3, 2019 Among 79 participating countries and economies, the Philippines scored the lowest in reading comprehension in the 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), according to the results released Tuesday.PISA is a worldwide study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that examines students’ knowledge in reading, mathematics, and science.Reading was the main subject assessed among 15-year old students in the 2018 PISA. The Philippines had an average reading score of 340, more than 200 points below China (555) and more than 100 points less than the OECD average (487).In the Philippines, boys’ and girls’ performances in reading both ranked lowest among PISA-participating countries.“Reading proficiency is essential for a wide variety of human activities - from following instructions in a manual; to finding out the who, what, when, where, and why of an event; to communicating with others for a specific purpose or transaction,” the summary of the PISA 2018 results reads.The Philippines also placed the second-lowest in mathematics (353), along with Panama, and science (357). Only the Dominican Republic scored lower in these categories.China also led the ranking in mathematics and science. The OECD average for mathematics is 489 and the average for science is 483.“Results from PISA indicate the quality and equity of learning outcomes attained around the world, and allow educators and policymakers to learn from the policies and practices applied in other countries,” a post on the OECD website reads.According to the PISA 2018 profile of the Philippines, socio-economic status accounts for 18% of the variance in reading performance in the country, compared to the OECD average of 12%.The country has the largest percentage of low performers in reading among socio-economically disadvantaged students.The profile noted that average class sizes of 15-year olds in the Philippines are the largest, and the ratio of students to teaching staff in socio-economically disadvantaged schools is the highest.The Philippines also had the highest percentage of students reporting being bullied at least a few times a month.Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they did not expect high marks based on National Achievement Test results, according to a report by The STAR.Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they were not expecting high marks for the Philippines, noting the results of the National Achievement Test which showed low proficiency levels in Science, Math and English​</h2><br />
