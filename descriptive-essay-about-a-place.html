For a descriptive essay, it always needs to describe. It is one paragraph long (three to five sentences). It needs to let the reader know what you are trying to write about.

For example: It was a cold, grey day in December; only three weeks away from New Year. 2. Create an atmosphere. For example: The road outside was hustling and bustling with Christmas shoppers. 3. Surprise the reader. For example: Who was creating the chaos in the street?​</a>

We have known each other for years, so I watched her growing up and transforming from a small, noisy girl to a confident young woman. I met Ann when we were six and were shy kids who did not even know how to communicate properly. I remember she was standing on the stairs of her house watching me play nearby. She was interested but afraid of talking to me, mostly because she had just moved in and knew no one in the neighborhood. Ann had blond, almost white hair, a round face, and small lips, and she was very thin. Interestingly, she has changed much since that time, especially her hair that became darker and changed its structure.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. When I was a child, my family went on a road trip across the country. One of our stops was at a national park in Wyoming. We decided to go on a hike and were amazed by the beauty of the landscape around us. As we were walking, we came across a group of bighorn sheep grazing nearby. My siblings and I were thrilled to see such magnificent animals up close. However, the highlight of the hike was when we stumbled upon a waterfall. The sound of the rushing water was deafening, but the sight of it was breathtaking. The sun was shining down on the water, creating a rainbow in the mist. We sat there in awe for what felt like hours, taking in all the beauty nature had to offer. It was a moment I will never forget.</p><p></p>2. My favorite place to visit is my grandmother's house in the countryside. The drive up to her house is surrounded by lush greenery, and the air is fresh and crisp. Her house is perched on top of a hill, overlooking acres of rolling farmland. As I walk through the front door, the aroma of her home-cooked meals fills the air. Her living room is cozy and warm, with a fireplace and comfortable furniture. Her bookshelf is filled with classic novels and history books. The best part of her house, however, is the porch. It wraps around the entire house and has the most stunning view. I can sit there for hours, reading a book or just gazing out at the breathtaking scenery. A slight breeze blows through the porch, carrying with it the sound of birds chirping and leaves rustling. It's my favorite place to relax and escape the stresses of daily life.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>#Brainlyme!! <p></p><p></p><br />

                            19. Activity 3.3: Looking into Different Parts of a Descriptive Essay A. Introduction The introduction is an important part of an essay. For a descriptive essay, it always needs to describe. It is one paragraph long (three to five sentences). It needs to let the reader know what you are trying to write about. It also needs to begin in a way that will make the reader want to go on and find out what happens. It could: 1. Tell the time and place you are writing about - set the scene. For example: It was a cold, grey day in December; only three weeks away from New Year. 2. Create an atmosphere. For example: The road outside was hustling and bustling with Christmas shoppers. 3. Surprise the reader. For example: Who was creating the chaos in the street?​</h2><br />

Against any opponent but a careful entomologist with a cardboard box, the mantis is a lethal hunter and master of camouflage. Its four front legs, head and thorax are covered in delicate structures resembling colorful flower petals. In appearance, it looks like nothing so much as a praying mantis covered in beautiful painted fans.</p><p>As for its behavior, like any good mantis, it is an ambush predator. It takes full advantage of its unique appearance, settling amongst the petals of orchids and awaiting visiting insects. It favors butterflies and moths for its meals, but will happily take any insect on offer. Indeed, it need not even be an insect: particularly voracious orchid mantises have been known to feed on small lizards, frogs, mice and even birds.</p><p>Its behavior among its own kind is no different. Like many mantises, orchid mantises are opportunistic cannibals. They don't go out of their way to devour their own kind, but should one stray into striking range of another when it's feeling peckish, it may well become a meal.coronatus is not recorded as performing the praying mantis's infamous reproductive cannibalism, however.</p><p>Its relationship to humans is neutral, verging on positive. H. coronatus is not an ally of the committed gardener like the aphid-devouring ladybug, but it will nibble on any pests that present themselves. Aside from that, the orchid mantis is only valuable to humans for its extraordinary beauty.</p><p></p><p>Hymenopus coronatus is an example of a unique form of beauty that exists only in nature, careless of human judgment, designed for function rather than form, but still capable of making an observer catch their breath at its strange loveliness.</p><p></p><p><strong>Ps:</strong><strong> </strong>Siguro ibahin mo na lang ng konti </p><br />

During the pandemic, while we were stuck in our rooms hoping to find the cure, frontliners were working 24/7 for us. Tiring and sleepless days they have gone through just for our benefit. They were sweating profusely in their medical and thick hazmat suits. Tight facemasks start to leave a mark on their faces. And having to use multiple masks, frontliners were catching up their breaths making it hard to talk. Additionally, one of their challenges was managing, not only the outbreak, but also taking care of the patients. But regardless, despite the stress, pressure, anxiousness, and tiredness, they were still determined to get the job done. And for that, they are truly the definition of modern-day heroes.</p><br />
