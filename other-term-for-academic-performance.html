In this thesis study, the retrospective study design used correlational methods to determine the difficulties of students in terms of reading comprehension. The study was based on analysis of reading comprehension levels and academic performance of the Grade 8 students in Sta. Cruz Institute. The correlational was used to determine prevalence and relationships among variables. A questionnaire was used in this study as an instrument to gather the necessary information needed from the respondents. The questionnaire is composed of two sets. The first set provides the questions necessary to determine the profile of the students. The second set on the other hand, provides for the questions to determine their level of difficulty in reading comprehension that affects their academic performance. The school is a Private Catholic School. They choose this location for their study because it is much efficient for their effort, time, and money in conducting their study since the chosen respondents are the students of the school. The respondents of the study consisted of Junior High School Students of Sta. Cruz Institute who asked about the Level of Difficulty in Reading Comprehension of the Grade 8 students. The main instrument used was questionnaire or survey particularly in rating scale, where the respondents answer the answer sheets themselves from the pointers listed from the questionnaire.

Everyone is exposed to stress at some time in their lives, that uncomfortable situation that af- fects our sense of well-being and quality of life 2. These students face, social, emotional and physi- cal and family problems which may affect their learning ability and academic performance (Fish &amp; Nies, 1996; Chewgrahan, Rogers &amp; Yassin, 2003). 3. Some people are simply not bothered by situa- tions that other perceives to be stressful (Glavin et al. 1991). 4. "Increased stress increases productivity up to a point, after which things rapidly deteriorate," said Paul J. Rosch, M.D. (2007), and President of the American Institute of Stress. Using stress con- structively depends on understanding where that line is between stress as performance enhancer and stress as stumbling block. 5. A layperson may define stress in terms of pres- sure, tension, unpleasant external forces or an emotional response (Ogden, 2004, P.234​</a>

                                            ACTIVITY #2. Identify in which section of the research paper each of these extracts is likely to appear and write it beside the extract. Use the 12 section names that were referred to in ACTIVITY#1. You don't need to try to understand the exact content of each extract. Just look for clues that help you find the answer.1.As youths look for sources of information, emotional understanding and cues for the expression of their emerging social and personal identity, they often find music to provide them with valuable meanings (Zillman and Gan, 1987). 2. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of teen pop lyrics and their significance at the personal and sociocultural level.3.In our analysis, we included all the artists featured on the Disney Channel Network (hereafter, DCN) during the third week of December 2000 in order to draw a broad sample of contemporary teen pop performers. We chose the DCN because it is one of only two TV cable channels whose programming is dedicated TIV exclusively to pre-adolescents and adolescents. Whereas the label 'rock' has often been used as an umbrella term to catch just about any genre other than classical, one particular style that has been largely ignored by academic observers is teen pop. The influence of teen pop in pre-adolescent and adolescent.4.culture can no longer be ignored given its increasingly dominant role in music sales, TV and radio airplay, the proliferation of popular female performers and all-boy bands, and the integration of individual teen pop stars into advertising campaigns by Fortune 500 corporations (e.g., Burger King, McDonald's, PepsiCo, Inc.).5. While reading these lyrics, we encountered numerous stories of obsessive thinking, potent feelings of attachment, and mentions of much emotional and physical support received and offered through care and sex that seem to guarantee these lovers vital stimulation and freedom. In short, dependence on love seems to be a form of perceived self-insufficiency, a feeling that one cannot bear one's existence by oneself. Teen pop music writers and performers narrate vividly the details of these feelings of insufficiency.​pasagot po thanks</a>

In this thesis study, the retrospective study design used correlational methods to determine the difficulties of students in terms of reading comprehension. The study was based on analysis of reading comprehension levels and academic performance of the Grade 8 students in Sta. Cruz Institute. The correlational was used to determine prevalence and relationships among variables. A questionnaire was used in this study as an instrument to gather the necessary information needed from the respondents. The questionnaire is composed of two sets. The first set provides the questions necessary to determine the profile of the students. The second set on the other hand, provides for the questions to determine their level of difficulty in reading comprehension that affects their academic performance. The school is a Private Catholic School. They choose this location for their study because it is much efficient for their effort, time, and money in conducting their study since the chosen respondents are the students of the school. The respondents of the study consisted of Junior High School Students of Sta. Cruz Institute who asked about the Level of Difficulty in Reading Comprehension of the Grade 8 students. The main instrument used was questionnaire or survey particularly in rating scale, where the respondents answer the answer sheets themselves from the pointers listed from the questionnaire. It was developed by the researchers although some of the questionnaires were based from other studies and resources available in the books.​</h2><br />

Everyone is exposed to stress at some time in their lives, that uncomfortable situation that af- fects our sense of well-being and quality of life 2. These students face, social, emotional and physi- cal and family problems which may affect their learning ability and academic performance (Fish &amp; Nies, 1996; Chewgrahan, Rogers &amp; Yassin, 2003). 3. Some people are simply not bothered by situa- tions that other perceives to be stressful (Glavin et al. 1991). 4. "Increased stress increases productivity up to a point, after which things rapidly deteriorate," said Paul J. Rosch, M.D. (2007), and President of the American Institute of Stress. Using stress con- structively depends on understanding where that line is between stress as performance enhancer and stress as stumbling block. 5. A layperson may define stress in terms of pres- sure, tension, unpleasant external forces or an emotional response (Ogden, 2004, P.234​</h2><br />

Use the 12 section names that were referred to in ACTIVITY#1. You don't need to try to understand the exact content of each extract. Just look for clues that help you find the answer.1.As youths look for sources of information, emotional understanding and cues for the expression of their emerging social and personal identity, they often find music to provide them with valuable meanings (Zillman and Gan, 1987). 2. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of teen pop lyrics and their significance at the personal and sociocultural level.3.In our analysis, we included all the artists featured on the Disney Channel Network (hereafter, DCN) during the third week of December 2000 in order to draw a broad sample of contemporary teen pop performers. We chose the DCN because it is one of only two TV cable channels whose programming is dedicated TIV exclusively to pre-adolescents and adolescents. Whereas the label 'rock' has often been used as an umbrella term to catch just about any genre other than classical, one particular style that has been largely ignored by academic observers is teen pop. The influence of teen pop in pre-adolescent and adolescent.4.culture can no longer be ignored given its increasingly dominant role in music sales, TV and radio airplay, the proliferation of popular female performers and all-boy bands, and the integration of individual teen pop stars into advertising campaigns by Fortune 500 corporations (e.g., Burger King, McDonald's, PepsiCo, Inc.).5. While reading these lyrics, we encountered numerous stories of obsessive thinking, potent feelings of attachment, and mentions of much emotional and physical support received and offered through care and sex that seem to guarantee these lovers vital stimulation and freedom. In short, dependence on love seems to be a form of perceived self-insufficiency, a feeling that one cannot bear one's existence by oneself. Teen pop music writers and performers narrate vividly the details of these feelings of insufficiency.​pasagot po thanks</h2><br />
