                                            identify whether the speech below is memorized, extemporaneous or impromptu.1. My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2. "So I'd like you all to charge your glasses and join me in toasting the new Mr and Mrs Brown! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom" "Wishing them all the health, wealth and happiness in the world, I'd like you all to join me in toasting the happy couple3. I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my careerand wnat will l'become? As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4. On behalf of the Government of Vietnam, I would like to convey my warmest welcome to all distinguished delegates and guests attending the Vietnam Business Summit on the occasion of the 2017 APEC Economic Leaders' Week. May I extend my warmest greetings to all distinguished guests and delegations, representatives from organizations and enterprises, experts and investors Vietnamese and international alike.​</a>

                                            Activity 5.1. AUTOBIOGRAPHY Autobiography of a StudentMy name is Elizabeth Austen. I was born on May 2, 2002 in Marseille, France. I was raised as a child of two cultures: American and French. Although my parents were born in the USA, they left for Marseille after their wedding because of career goals. My father is a translator, and my mother is an art consultant, so the atmosphere of our house was creative and artistic.It was difficult for me to make friends with French peers. That’s why I have always communicated with adults who were my parents’ friends or colleagues. Since childhood, I have had a thirst for knowledge and new discoveries, and elder friends were happy to share their memories and life experiences with a little, curious girl.I have a talent for learning languages and studying art. That’s not surprising taking into account my environment. When I was a teenager, I dreamed of becoming a writer. I still store my notebooks as a memory about my first drafts.Later on, I understood that my heart belongs to art. I spent much time in my mother’s office listening to her impromptu lectures about famous paintings. Her lessons along with her stories about the USA have inspired me to go to the United States and attend the California College of the Arts to get a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art History.My main belief in life is that everything should be in harmony. People have to keep balance in all spheres of life: society, family, work, friendship, and others. Studying art is my personal way to keep balance. I’m driven by my passion to visit all cities with a rich artistic history: Venice, Rome, London, San-Francisco, Tokyo, and so many others. These journeys will not only improve my professional skills but also will help to learn more about myself and people.I believe that studying at the California College of the Arts will allow me to become a real professional with a mature art taste and extensive knowledge of art history. In the future, I will follow my mother’s footsteps in order to help people discover the beautiful world of art. If my career as an art consultant isn’t successful, I will dedicate my life to teaching future generations of students and cultivating their love of fine arts.1. Who are the characters?2.

                                            Have you been curious of when and where did life possibly start on Earth? During the 1800s, geologists and the naturalists found several forms of physical evidence that confirmed that Earth is very old. The evidence includes: fossils of ancient sea life on dry land far from oceans, this supported the idea that the Earth changed over time and some dry land today was once covered by oceans; the many layers of rock allowed the people to realize that rock layers represent the order in which rocks and fossils appeared, thus they were able to trace the history of Earth and life on Earth; lastly, the indications that volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and erosion that happened long ago shaped much of the Earth’s surface and supported the idea of an older Earth. This module will help you understand the historical development of the concept of life based on emerging pieces of evidence. This will trace back the events, processes, and living organisms existed on earth from the earliest time to present.

                                            Dreams remain fuel of every nation over the world as the diversity put hold on us whatever our race, religion, culture, language and history. It has the mankind to create and embody the empowerment of ideals, principles in life, importance of education, patriotism, and the belief that the youth are tomorrow's hope. These are how Dr. Jose Rizal dreamed and eventually evoked for the continuity of his powerful existence for the Filipinos beyond the future. He is still here - lasts forever!
 This is the very bible facts about the so-called National Hero (by the Filipinos) of the Philippines, Dr. José Rizal, that you didn't probably know. His life and works, and everything in the past that you have really want to know. Also, I have my own research and perception. It's history!
 Who cares? Well, you're a worthy Filipino, not a Japanese or an alien. Our history is the republic. Therefore, our republic is the history. Stand firmly.

                        <p>I was born and raised in a small town in the countryside. I grew up with my parents and two siblings, and we were very close as a family. I went to a local elementary and high school, and I was always very interested in learning and exploring new things. After graduating, I attended a nearby college and studied literature. I then moved to the city to pursue a career in writing and publishing. Over the years, I have had many adventures and experiences that have shaped me into the person I am today. I am grateful for the support and love of my family and friends, and I am excited for what the future holds.</p><br />

                            2. what is my life history? why is it important to reflect on my Life as an ordinary person?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>what is my life history?</strong></p><p>Life stories do not only describe our lives, they define them. These stories do far more than re-tell what happened to us, they also set the stage for what will happen to us.
</p><p>
We have all met the person who carries a negative life story. It might focus on limitations or bad luck. It might blame someone or something. But the message is strong. I can't do things now because of my past experience.
</p><p>
We have also met the person who seems to emanate possibility and joy. Someone who says my life story is about how I respond to challenges, how I appreciate what I have.

Imagine that every morning as you get out of bed, you reach down and pick up a briefcase filled with your life story. Then you carry it with you all day. What does yours say?
</p><p>
Does your story say you have suffered loss or been hurt so deeply that you will never get over it? Or does your story say, "Life is hard sometimes, but I am resourceful, not to mention still breathing, and I have free choice and the ability to change patterns that don't work for me."
</p><p>
These are generalizations, I know. But you can fill in your own blanks. The point is simple: a life story tells you who you are, and that definition will have a profound effect on how you live you life.</p><p></p><p><strong>why is it important to reflect on my Life as an ordinary person?</strong></p><p>Self-reflection will assist you in processing your emotions and thoughts.

                            9. identify whether the speech below is memorized, extemporaneous or impromptu.1. My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2. "So I'd like you all to charge your glasses and join me in toasting the new Mr and Mrs Brown! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom" "Wishing them all the health, wealth and happiness in the world, I'd like you all to join me in toasting the happy couple3. I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my careerand wnat will l'become? As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4. On behalf of the Government of Vietnam, I would like to convey my warmest welcome to all distinguished delegates and guests attending the Vietnam Business Summit on the occasion of the 2017 APEC Economic Leaders' Week. May I extend my warmest greetings to all distinguished guests and delegations, representatives from organizations and enterprises, experts and investors Vietnamese and international alike.​</h2><br />

                            14. Activity 5.1. AUTOBIOGRAPHY Autobiography of a StudentMy name is Elizabeth Austen. I was born on May 2, 2002 in Marseille, France. I was raised as a child of two cultures: American and French. Although my parents were born in the USA, they left for Marseille after their wedding because of career goals. My father is a translator, and my mother is an art consultant, so the atmosphere of our house was creative and artistic.It was difficult for me to make friends with French peers. That’s why I have always communicated with adults who were my parents’ friends or colleagues. Since childhood, I have had a thirst for knowledge and new discoveries, and elder friends were happy to share their memories and life experiences with a little, curious girl.I have a talent for learning languages and studying art. That’s not surprising taking into account my environment. When I was a teenager, I dreamed of becoming a writer. I still store my notebooks as a memory about my first drafts.Later on, I understood that my heart belongs to art. I spent much time in my mother’s office listening to her impromptu lectures about famous paintings. Her lessons along with her stories about the USA have inspired me to go to the United States and attend the California College of the Arts to get a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art History.My main belief in life is that everything should be in harmony. People have to keep balance in all spheres of life: society, family, work, friendship, and others. Studying art is my personal way to keep balance. I’m driven by my passion to visit all cities with a rich artistic history: Venice, Rome, London, San-Francisco, Tokyo, and so many others. These journeys will not only improve my professional skills but also will help to learn more about myself and people.I believe that studying at the California College of the Arts will allow me to become a real professional with a mature art taste and extensive knowledge of art history. In the future, I will follow my mother’s footsteps in order to help people discover the beautiful world of art. If my career as an art consultant isn’t successful, I will dedicate my life to teaching future generations of students and cultivating their love of fine arts.1. Who are the characters?2.

                            15. Have you been curious of when and where did life possibly start on Earth? During the 1800s, geologists and the naturalists found several forms of physical evidence that confirmed that Earth is very old. The evidence includes: fossils of ancient sea life on dry land far from oceans, this supported the idea that the Earth changed over time and some dry land today was once covered by oceans; the many layers of rock allowed the people to realize that rock layers represent the order in which rocks and fossils appeared, thus they were able to trace the history of Earth and life on Earth; lastly, the indications that volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and erosion that happened long ago shaped much of the Earth’s surface and supported the idea of an older Earth. This module will help you understand the historical development of the concept of life based on emerging pieces of evidence. This will trace back the events, processes, and living organisms existed on earth from the earliest time to present.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.	Go back to Philippine history or newspaper in the late 80s and find out how the acronym "GG" came out. Whom was it notably ascribed to? Why?  </p><p>GG means galunggong. In the Philippines, the measure of high inflation and economic depression is the price of galunggong (Blue Mackerel fish). This is because it is the cheapest food that Filipinos can eat.  </p><p>2.	What particular period in the persona's life did he relate "Ligo" to? Explain why.  </p><p>The Ligo was articulated by the author during his university days.  He explained that it was food in the ‘70s whenever there is a rally.  </p><p>3.	What did he refer to as "Balara Hilton"? Explain its implication on the politics and the life of Filipino during the Marcos regime.  </p><p>Balara Hilton is a street near UP Diliman. It’s a ramshackle house for cheaper food. The implication of it is that during the ‘70s, student rallies and picket lines were more often.  </p><p>4.	Explain what the persona means when he said : "he was indentured to City Bank for life".
</p><p>Indenture means a contract between individuals within a set time period. This refers to loans, inheritance and etc. As the author has said that because he is living in the United States and that cash is no longer king but plastic money. Because of credit and loans, he becomes a slave to corporate life and consumerism.  </p><p>5.	Why does the persona consider seafood as "one of the lousiest ironies in this country"?
</p><p>The author said that the country is rich in seafood, however, the irony is that the country is in extreme poverty. Despite the wealth in resources of the country, the locals themselves can’t afford it.  </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/13226232</p><p></p><br />

                            25. Dreams remain fuel of every nation over the world as the diversity put hold on us whatever our race, religion, culture, language and history. It has the mankind to create and embody the empowerment of ideals, principles in life, importance of education, patriotism, and the belief that the youth are tomorrow's hope. These are how Dr. Jose Rizal dreamed and eventually evoked for the continuity of his powerful existence for the Filipinos beyond the future. He is still here - lasts forever!
 This is the very bible facts about the so-called National Hero (by the Filipinos) of the Philippines, Dr. José Rizal, that you didn't probably know. His life and works, and everything in the past that you have really want to know. Also, I have my own research and perception. It's history!
 Who cares? Well, you're a worthy Filipino, not a Japanese or an alien. Our history is the republic. Therefore, our republic is the history. Stand firmly.
