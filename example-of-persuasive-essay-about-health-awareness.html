                        <p><strong>Answer:The choice to live a healthier lifestyle is usually made during one's youth, with sports, visits to the gym, and a generally active lifestyle leading to improved health. With obesity on the rise throughout most developed nations like United Kingdom and America, as the combination of junk food and stationary visual media creates a generation of people adverse to physical activity, the need to raise awareness about healthy living has never been greater. For members of my generation, who are in their late thirties or early forties, there are many legitimate reasons to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Unlike most other activities in life, exercising, and eating nutritionally balanced diet present a positive choice with clear advantages and no drawbacks. When you are physically fit as an adult, the benefits also extend to your emotional well being, providing a constructive outlet for negative feelings to be released in a constructive environment. Healthy living can also provide tremendous financial benefits, in the form of savings on groceries or the reduced likelihood of medical expenses, which is especially enticing considering the current economic climate. The following reasons to adopt a healthier lifestyle present the argument that eating right and exercising regularly are choices you simply can't afford to neglect.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        HEALTH AWARENESSS<p></p><p><strong>Health</strong> is our wealth.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p></p><p>Today, I want to talk to you about a critical issue that affects us all: evacuating an area in times of emergency. In particular, I want to persuade those of you who may be hesitant to evacuate during a crisis that it is vital to do so.</p><p></p><p>I understand that leaving your home and possessions behind can be a daunting prospect, but sometimes, it is necessary to preserve your life and the lives of your loved ones. In the face of natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, staying behind can be a fatal decision. Therefore, I implore you to take the necessary steps to evacuate when advised to do so.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, it is essential to remember that emergency personnel, such as firefighters and rescue workers, are trained to handle these situations. They are there to help, but they need you to follow their instructions. If they ask you to evacuate, it is because they believe that it is in your best interest to do so. By staying behind, you not only put yourself at risk but also those who may have to rescue you.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, your home can be replaced, but your life cannot. No material possession is worth risking your life for. Your house, your car, your belongings can all be replaced, but your life is precious and irreplaceable. It is vital to value your life above all else.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, when you evacuate, you are not alone. You are part of a community that is facing the same crisis, and the evacuation center is there to help you. The center provides food, shelter, and medical care if needed. You will have access to resources that will help you and your family through this difficult time.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, I urge you all to take evacuation orders seriously. Remember that your life is precious, and emergency personnel are there to help. Do not hesitate to evacuate when advised to do so. By doing so, you will not only be saving your life but also that of your loved ones. Thank you.</p><br />

From improved cardiovascular health to weight loss and stress reduction, the benefits of running are numerous and well-documented. In this essay, I will discuss the healthful benefits of running and why it is an excellent choice for anyone looking to improve their physical and mental well-being.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, running is an excellent form of cardiovascular exercise. When you run, your heart and lungs work together to pump oxygen-rich blood throughout your body, improving your cardiovascular health and reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other chronic illnesses. Running can also help to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels, further reducing your risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><p></p><p>In addition to its cardiovascular benefits, running is also an effective way to lose weight and maintain a healthy body weight. When you run, your body burns calories at a high rate, helping you to shed excess weight and build muscle tone. Running can also help to improve your metabolism, making it easier to maintain a healthy weight over time.</p><p></p><p>Another benefit of running is its ability to reduce stress and improve mental health. Running releases endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals, which can help to reduce anxiety and depression and improve overall mood. Running can also provide a sense of accomplishment and boost self-esteem, which can be beneficial for individuals struggling with mental health issues.</p><p></p><p>Finally, running can be a fun and social activity, providing opportunities for individuals to connect with others and build friendships. Running clubs and groups are common in many communities, offering a supportive and motivating environment for individuals to pursue their fitness goals.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, running provides numerous healthful benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, weight loss, stress reduction, and improved mental health. Whether you are a seasoned runner or just starting out, incorporating running into your exercise routine can be an excellent choice for improving your overall health and well-being. So, if you haven't already, lace up your running shoes and start reaping the many benefits of this popular form of exercise!</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

All of that sounds simple enough, but simply doesn’t always mean easy. You’ll need a good strategy to break some of those bad habits. Knowing you need to change something usually isn’t enough motivation to do it. You may even think there’s a good reason you do it.</p><p></p><p>For example, sometimes people who smoke feel like smoke breaks are the only times they can step away from their work during the day.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Good morning everyone!</p><p></p><p>My name is [name], and I am here today to talk to you about why you should stay in your evacuate area in the face of disaster.</p><p></p><p>Now, I know this may seem like a difficult concept to understand. It's common to want to escape danger and seek safety, but sometimes staying put is the best choice for you and your family.</p><p></p><p>The first thing to consider is the cost involved in evacuation. Taking a family away from their home and finding alternative housing can be expensive. Leaving your home may also mean leaving behind your belongings. It may also mean taking children out of school and disrupting their normal routines.</p><p></p><p>The second benefit of staying in your evacuate area is that some of the infrastructure may still be salvageable even after a disaster. Power, water and other vital services may be available and ready to be used, therefore reducing the cost of rebuilding.</p><p></p><p>The third benefit is the sense of community. People who stay in the evacuate area are likely to band together in order to rebuild their homes and their lives. This can create a strong bond between you and your new neighbours which can be invaluable following a disaster.</p><p></p><p>Finally, staying put can actually be the safest option in some cases. It can be safer to stay in your home rather than attempting to evacuate an unstable area. In addition, staying put may be the only option if you have special needs that require electricity or other services that are not available elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, I urge you to consider the cost, benefits, and safety when making a decision about staying or evacuating. In some cases, staying put can actually be the best choice. So please, take the time to evaluate your situation and make the decision that's best for you and your loved ones.</p><p></p><p>Thank you.</p><p>here↑</p><br />

                            19. Example of persuasive essay about cellphone</h2><br />
                        <p>Today, almost any parent can use a cellphone to ask their children about their whereabouts, occupation, or health. At the same time, most parents can remember the days when cellphones did not exist, and children were factually left on their own for at least half of the day. I believe cellphones today pose a great distraction for students—especially higher-end smartphones that provide numerous opportunities for entertainment—and thus should be prohibited from use in schools; but at the same time, I stand for not prohibiting cellphones from students’ possession entirely, since they allow parents to monitor their children’s safety.
</p><p>
</p><p>The first and foremost reason why cellphones should be prohibited from use in schools is that they pose a significant disruption in the educational process (School Security). The most obvious manifestation of such disruption is cheating during exams or other tests: access to the Internet, electronic books, and consulting with peers through mobile Skype right from the classroom. Phone rings, incoming message signals, and/or games interfere with the educational process by distracting teachers and students from classes. Even if the sound is turned off, a phone’s vibration still distracts students.</p><p></p><br />
