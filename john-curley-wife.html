He entered and saw that her favorite statuette was broken. At that moment someone ran out of the room. John tried to catch up with the stranger. But in the street the lenses on his eyeglasses fogged up because of cold weather. He could see nothing, giving the stranger the opportunity to disappear. John told this story to a policeman but he refused to investigate the case. The cop asked him to stop lying and admit that it was he who had broken the statuette. Was John's story actually fake?​</a>

                        sum of their age is 60<br />lito is 12 yrs older, therefore lito's wife is 48 yrs old<p>Let X be the age of lito's wife.<br />      X+12 be lito's age since he is 12 yrs older than his wife. <br /> We add these equations and equate it to 60.<br />X+X+12=60<br />Combine like terms and transpose 12 to the right.<br />2X=48<br />Divide both sides by 2<br />X=24<br />So, lito's wife is 24 yrs old.<br />To find lito's age we just add 12 to 24 , lito is 36 yrs old</p><br />
