                            3. (Essay) why Socialism is better than democracy​</h2><br />
                        <p>Socialism is an economic and political system that emphasizes collective ownership and control of the means of production, distribution, and exchange. The goal is to eliminate private ownership and create a society where resources are distributed based on need, rather than profit.</p><p>Democracy, on the other hand, is a political system that emphasizes individual rights and freedoms, as well as the power of the people to elect their leaders and make decisions through a system of voting and representation.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>While both socialism and democracy have their strengths and weaknesses, some argue that socialism is better than democracy because it prioritizes the needs of the collective over the needs of the individual. In a socialist society, resources are distributed based on need, rather than the ability to pay. This means that everyone has access to basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare, regardless of their income or social status.</p><p></p><p>In a democratic society, however, resources are often distributed based on wealth and power. This can lead to inequality and a lack of access to basic necessities for those who cannot afford them.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, socialism emphasizes cooperation and community, rather than competition and individualism. This can lead to a more cohesive and harmonious society, where people work together for the common good.</p><p></p><p>However, critics of socialism argue that it can lead to a lack of innovation and motivation, as there is no incentive for individuals to work harder or be more productive. They also argue that socialism can lead to a lack of personal freedom and individual rights, as the government has more control over people's lives and decisions.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the debate between socialism and democracy is complex and multifaceted, and there is no clear answer as to which system is better. It is up to each individual to weigh the pros and cons and decide which system aligns best with their values and beliefs. </p><p></p>PADAYON! and maybe some small gesture of making my answer the brainiest thank you! &lt;3 <p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Argumentative essayChristine RobinsonSocialism is a classic economic theory that developed in the 1820’s. It derives from theconcept that people should be able to live comfortably, be supplied with the necessities oflife, and ultimately be equal in all aspects by advocating for the community to control themeans of production. While converting to a full form of socialism would be very dangerousand complicated, we can start to transition and explore a more mild form of it, calleddemocratic socialism. Democratic socialism is when you keep the democratic side of oursociety, keep a loose form of a competitive economy, but support the lower class and comecloser to abolishing our toxic class system. This would occur in higher taxation to supportthe lower class, much better and accessible healthcare and welfare,a limit on theaccumulation of private property, and more government run industries. The ultimate goal ofsocialism, and any form of it, is to reduce class differences and try to support anyone thatneeds to be supported. It sounds amazing, but of course like most things political, it hascons. In this essay I'll be covering the pros of democratic socialism and also answering andaddressing arguments that are made against it.</p><p></p><p>#carry on learning</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>These two concepts are so broad that it is not entirely clear how one can say that Socialism is better than Democracy. However, when it comes to political issues, the principle of Socialism is often considered more complete and just.</p><p></p><p>In Socialism, the economy is centered on the people and not on wealthy corporations. Instead of setting the profits of wealthy business owners, workers and other citizens have the right to production and earnings from their jobs. In this way, excessive wealth gaps in society are avoided and the condition of the poor is improved.</p><p></p><p>In Democracy, power is in the hands of the people through voting. However, in practice, power is in the hands of a few wealthy individuals and corporations because of their ability to spread money in politics. Thus, citizens do not always achieve their true welfare due to the control of some of the sources of power.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if we are talking about political issues, Socialism can provide equal opportunities and equality in society. However, it is important to remember that no system is perfect and has its own limitations and challenges.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The importance of socmovements is the role in society is kinda not necessarily to be able yo achieve an agenda or solely change laws but social movement's role is to allow people the opportunity to come together, speak their mind, and make people aware of an issue that is close to their heart, the social movements are a prime or main example of our first amendment rights. Being able to practice free speech, organize peaceful protests and having the power to make a difference in our government are all great privileges of living in our country. Good Governance is defined to be the dynamic interaction between people, structures, processes and traditions; the act of good governance is composed of pillars, namely legitimacy, participation With this in mind, our group has determined that while good governance is a necessity for all governing bodies, not a lot of people are aware of what good governance entails and its effects on them. For the Philippines in particular. It can be argued that being aware of the different areas of good governance could give citizens a clearer picture as to what specific actions they can do to improve certain weak areas.</p><br />

While both systems aim to provide for the welfare of the people, democracy is a better form of governance than socialism for several reasons.<br /><br />Firstly, democracy promotes individual freedoms and rights. It allows citizens to freely express their opinions, beliefs, and thoughts without fear of retaliation. In contrast, socialism often requires individuals to surrender some of their freedoms for the greater good of society. This can lead to a suppression of individualism and creativity, which can hinder progress and development.<br /><br />Moreover, democracy encourages competition and innovation. It provides a level playing field for individuals and businesses to compete and succeed based on merit and hard work. Socialism, on the other hand, often limits competition by enforcing regulations and redistributing wealth. This can lead to a lack of motivation and incentive for individuals to strive for success, which can hinder economic growth.<br /><br />Another advantage of democracy is that it provides a system of checks and balances. This ensures that no one person or group has too much power, preventing corruption and abuse of power. In a socialist system, the government holds all the power, which can lead to authoritarianism and dictatorship.<br /><br />Additionally, democracy allows for a diversity of opinions and viewpoints. This creates a robust and inclusive society where people can express themselves freely and contribute to society in their unique ways. Socialism often requires everyone to conform to a particular ideology, which can lead to homogeneity and conformity.<br /><br />Lastly, democracy promotes transparency and accountability. The government is held accountable to the people through free and fair elections, providing an opportunity for citizens to remove leaders who do not act in their best interests. In a socialist system, the government is often not held accountable, leading to corruption and abuse of power.<br /><br />In conclusion, democracy is a better form of governance than socialism as it promotes individual freedoms and rights, encourages competition and innovation, provides a system of checks and balances, allows for a diversity of opinions and viewpoints, and promotes transparency and accountability. While socialism may appear to provide for the welfare of the people, it often comes at the expense of individual freedoms and progress. Democracy, on the other hand, creates a thriving and inclusive society that benefits everyone.<br />

We don’t often realize that we can change the status quo – we can define for ourselves what democracy means for us. We can have a role in influencing decisions that affect us on a regular basis – not just when we vote.</p><p> </p><p>People across the country are coming together to share their ideas and opinions with others and to work together to create better communities on a wide range of issues such as education, food security, racial equity, community-police relations, and building prosperity.

                        <p><strong>Participatory democracy earns justice and equality, so I'll choose it. Because citizens in a participatory democracy have the power to make policy decisions directly, and politicians are responsible for putting those policies into effect. It is more appropriate in our situation than representative democracy, since if you have money, influence, and a well-known name, you are more likely to be a leader, even if you are unqualified. If representative democracy persists, our country will never improve and will remain at its lowest point.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Democracy in Nigeria has been repeatedly promised by those in power for decades, but promises seem to fall short of their mark and Nigeria remains to be anything but a true democracy. For a democracy to be successful the people of a country need to feel like they matter, their vote matters, and that the government cares about them. A true democracy is “people initiated, people promoted, sustained by the people for the benefit of the people”, (Ogunleye, 2005) but in a country swept with corruption the only thing sustained by the people is the oil industry and croplands. Nigeria may be far from a working democracy but at least initiatives have existed to put one into place. For Nigeria’s future, it is not impossible to create a sustainable democracy, but a lot of work must be done.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pako brainliest po kung tama </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The 2010 campaign has drawn to a close, and it’s time to distill my experiences after registering hundreds of miles by land, sea, and air crisscrossing the country as a party-list candidate.
</p><p>
</p><p>On the purely physical side, my shaking thousands of hands—I estimated some 3,500 in one two-hour period in the public market in Angeles, Pampanga—has apparently given my right arm a life of its own, like that of Dr. Strangelove or one of Jim Carrey’s characters. It twitches uncontrollably when not in action, as if waiting impatiently to be fed.
</p><p>There is no doubt in my mind that Philippine democracy is alive. Everywhere I went, there was intense interest in the candidates, particularly the presidential candidates, with many pausing from their labors to inquire which presidential nominee I favored and what program my party Akbayan had to offer. Everywhere the courtship of the voter was intense. Gone are the days when the “command vote” for a candidate could be considered sufficient to deliver victory. Except in the remotest places, the “market vote” has increased in both size and decisiveness. The market vote is no statistical abstraction for candidates: In almost every municipality and city, it has become de rigueur for candidates to present and sell themselves in the public market, trying to shake every hand within reach, even the wet hands of fish and meat vendors embarrassed to extend them.
</p><p>
</p><p>Most of the time, the cynics say, the people are at the mercy of the politicians. Maybe, but for at least three months every three years, the politicians are at the mercy of the voters.
</p><p>
</p><p>Philippine democracy is alive, but is it well?
</p><p>
</p><p>It is difficult to answer in the affirmative. The reason for this goes beyond the fact that come election day, scores will have been gunned down and huge sums will have been passed out to buy votes.
</p><p>
</p><p>What worries me, more than the violence and the vote-buying, of which we will always have a good dosage of, is the skyrocketing cost of elections. P9 billion is now said to be a conservative estimate for a presidential run, and P1.1 billion for somebody running for the Senate is said to be a low figure. For a candidate for Congress, P450 million is definitely on the low side. Most of these sums are spent on media outreach, particularly television. One is tempted to say the media is king. It might be more appropriate to say that the market is king, since it is the demand for advertising space, in a system where there are few legal constraints on electoral spending on media exposure, that raises its price many times over in the course of the 12-week election period.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>  <strong>1        </strong><br />          The status of democracy in the Philippines is a complex and multifaceted issue. On one hand, the Philippines is a democratic country with regular elections, a free press, and a relatively active civil society. On the other hand, the country has a long history of corruption, political violence, and human rights abuses, which have undermined the integrity and effectiveness of its democratic institutions.</p><p></p><p>          One of the major challenges facing democracy in the Philippines is the concentration of power in the hands of a few elites. The country has a long history of oligarchic rule, with a small group of powerful families and businesses controlling much of the country's wealth and political power. This has led to widespread inequality and a lack of representation for the majority of Filipinos, particularly those in rural and marginalized communities.</p><p></p><p>          Another major challenge is the high level of corruption in the country. The Philippines ranks poorly on international measures of corruption, with high levels of both petty and grand corruption. This has led to a lack of trust in the government and democratic institutions, and has contributed to a sense of cynicism and disillusionment among the general public.</p><p></p><p>          Despite these challenges, there are also positive signs for democracy in the Philippines. The country has a vibrant civil society, with a strong tradition of advocacy and activism. There are also a number of strong democratic movements and organizations working to promote greater transparency, accountability, and participation in the political process.</p><p></p><p>          Overall, the status of democracy in the Philippines is mixed. While the country has made progress in building democratic institutions, there are still significant challenges to overcome in terms of inequality, corruption, and the concentration of power. However, with continued efforts by civil society and democratic movements, it is possible for the Philippines to continue to build a more inclusive and effective democracy.</p><p><strong>________________________________________________________</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>300 Essay words about true majority democracy</p><p></p><p>True majority democracy is a form of governance that allows for the fair representation of the larger population and their preferences. The concept of democratic rule is rooted in the idea of equal voice and power given to every citizen, regardless of their socio-economic or political status. In a true majority democracy, every vote counts and the public has the power to influence, shape, and ultimately determine the course of the nation's government. It is a system of government that emphasizes the value of the people’s participation, and through this participation, their voices are heard and their needs addressed.</p><p></p><p>In a true majority democracy, all citizens participate equally in the decision-making process that affects their daily lives. The views and opinions of each member of the society are given due consideration and proportionate weight in the formation of public policies. In addition, the majority holds the power, but that power is tempered by respect for minority rights. This means that while the views and opinions of the minority may not be the most popular, they are still valued and considered in the decision-making process.</p><p></p><p>The essence of true majority democracy lies in ensuring that the right to vote is respected and the people's will is upheld. It requires a transparent and impartial system that is free of corruption, oppression, and discrimination. It is vital that a fair balance is maintained between the needs of the public and those of the government, ensuring that the rights and interests of the people always come first.</p><p></p><p>Overall, true majority democracy is a system of government that is anchored on the ideals of freedom, equality, participation, and justice. It provides an inclusive environment where all citizens can contribute their ideas, opinions, and visions of a better society. In conclusion, true majority democracy is about honoring the aspirations, needs, and rights of the people, and allowing them to actively participate in the democratic process that governs their lives.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Democracy is a system of government where the entire population or eligible members of the state have the opportunity to vote on issues directly or send someone that they elect to make those decisions on their behalf. It is a governing structure where rule comes from the people instead of the military or state. Although it is an option that is usually associated with the United States, the Declaration of Independence makes no word of this option.</p><p></p><p>The founding fathers of the United States actually feared the idea of democratic rule. James Madison mentioned in one of the federalist papers that this form of government could lead to confusion, instability, and injustice.
