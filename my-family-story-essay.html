                                            "Are You A Carrot, Egg or Coffee Bean?" A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved a new one arose. Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water. In the first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil without saying a word. In about twenty minute she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee into a bowl. Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me what you see?" "Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied. She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. She then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled, as she tasted its rich aroma. The daughter then asked, "What's the point, mother?" Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity... boiling water - but each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior. But, after being through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling water they had changed the water. "Which are you?" she asked the daughter. "When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?" Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength? Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after death, a break up, a financial hardship, or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and a hardened heart? Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you. When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest do you elevate to another level? How do you handle adversity? ARE YOU A CARROT, AN EGG, OR A COFFEE BEAN?make an essay using this guide questions:1. what is the story about?2. what message does it convey?3. as a family how can you apply the lessons you learned from the story?​</a>

Then, write the hook and the thesis statement on the boxes below._____ According to recent reports, cigarette smoking in youth is getting serious. Global Youth Tobacco Survey 2011 (GYTS), a school-based national survey, showed that 13.7 percent of students are currently using tobacco. Although 92 percent of the surveyed schools already included tobacco control in their curriculum, it was not a priority in schools, division offices, and local government units. Thus, the Department of Education (DepEd) called for the effective implementation of a cohesive and comprehensive tobacco control program in schools through a new policy, DepEd Order No. 48, s. 2016._____ However, despite thousands of programs to reduce youth smoking and hundreds of thousands of media stories on the dangers of tobacco use, generation after generation continues to use these deadly products, and family after family continues to suffer the devastating consequences. Ultimately, students should be intensively educated on the harms of tobacco use and health hazards of smoking including giving corrective actions to offenders. This is not only to save them from the “slow death” but to secure the nation’s public and economic health in the future.____ Therefore, DepEd Order No. 48 is a very vital policy, which should be followed and applied to all schools and DepEd offices to completely trash the ash and for everyone to savor a breath of fresh air.____ No surprise, cigarette smoking can literally “take your breath away.” It’s no secret that tobacco has finally been linked to being a bad drug which wreaks havoc on your body. Its avoidance is a general goal but for many years now, the issue on cigarette smoking particularly in schools still hasn’t declined. That’s why we should advocate in educating the youth on the adverse effects of tobacco and make it clear that just starting to smoke can end up giving them lifetime problems.Hook: _____________Thesis Statement: ____________​</a>

                            5. "Are You A Carrot, Egg or Coffee Bean?" A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved a new one arose. Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water. In the first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil without saying a word. In about twenty minute she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee into a bowl. Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me what you see?" "Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied. She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. She then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled, as she tasted its rich aroma. The daughter then asked, "What's the point, mother?" Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity... boiling water - but each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior. But, after being through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling water they had changed the water. "Which are you?" she asked the daughter. "When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?" Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength? Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after death, a break up, a financial hardship, or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and a hardened heart? Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you. When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest do you elevate to another level? How do you handle adversity? ARE YOU A CARROT, AN EGG, OR A COFFEE BEAN?make an essay using this guide questions:1. what is the story about?2. what message does it convey?3. as a family how can you apply the lessons you learned from the story?​</h2><br />

                            8. Activity 1: YOU’RE MY NUMBER ONEArrange the following paragraphs logically to form the parts of an argumentative essay by putting the numbers 1 to 4 on the space before the textbox. Then, write the hook and the thesis statement on the boxes below._____ According to recent reports, cigarette smoking in youth is getting serious. Global Youth Tobacco Survey 2011 (GYTS), a school-based national survey, showed that 13.7 percent of students are currently using tobacco. Although 92 percent of the surveyed schools already included tobacco control in their curriculum, it was not a priority in schools, division offices, and local government units. Thus, the Department of Education (DepEd) called for the effective implementation of a cohesive and comprehensive tobacco control program in schools through a new policy, DepEd Order No. 48, s. 2016._____ However, despite thousands of programs to reduce youth smoking and hundreds of thousands of media stories on the dangers of tobacco use, generation after generation continues to use these deadly products, and family after family continues to suffer the devastating consequences. Ultimately, students should be intensively educated on the harms of tobacco use and health hazards of smoking including giving corrective actions to offenders. This is not only to save them from the “slow death” but to secure the nation’s public and economic health in the future.____ Therefore, DepEd Order No. 48 is a very vital policy, which should be followed and applied to all schools and DepEd offices to completely trash the ash and for everyone to savor a breath of fresh air.____ No surprise, cigarette smoking can literally “take your breath away.” It’s no secret that tobacco has finally been linked to being a bad drug which wreaks havoc on your body. Its avoidance is a general goal but for many years now, the issue on cigarette smoking particularly in schools still hasn’t declined. That’s why we should advocate in educating the youth on the adverse effects of tobacco and make it clear that just starting to smoke can end up giving them lifetime problems.Hook: _____________Thesis Statement: ____________​</h2><br />
