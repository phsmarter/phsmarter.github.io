                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Kitchen Safety And Sanitation</p><p></p><p>Do you follow the proper safety and sanitation guidelines in your kitchen? You probably think that your kitchen is safe and you're not at risk of food poison. Well, there is a lot more about safety and sanitation that you should know.</p><p></p><p>Microorganisms are tiny living creatures that are only visible through a microscope. Parasites are organisms that get their nutrients from other living organisms. Microorganisms and parasites are everywhere in your kitchen. These are what can cause much food poisoning. You probably think that they don't live in your kitchen because you keep it clean, right? Think again.</p><p></p><p>Have you ever heard of cross contamination? That is when you let microorganisms from one food get into another. Of course, you're wondering how this could happen. Well, cross contamination can happen in many different ways. It can happen by simply not washing your kitchen appliances after each use. This means that you have to wash your can opener and your cutting board after each use. For example, if you cut raw meat on your cutting board, then you chop fresh vegetables on the same board without washing it, you are cross contaminating your food.</p><p></p><p>Washing your hands is a very important practice in kitchen safety and sanitation. You should always try to keep your hands clean. It is a good idea to wash your hands 20 seconds before handling food. remember to always wash your hands after using the toilet, blowing your nose, or touching your hair or your face. Germs can easily be spread if the careful precautions are not taken.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        There are already countless of rules and regulations being implemented and not all of them are being strictly followed by the people. One of the most common safety rules that are often being ignored are traffic rules. In general. People tend to follow rules when there are people watching. More so if there are officers watching. I saw drivers not stopping on the stop signs, unloading on a 'no loading or unloading' spots, parking on a 'no parking' spaces, and going over assigned speed limit. <br />If no traffic officer is watching. Especially during night time. Thus, resulting to accidents. Accidents that shouldn't have happened had everyone posses integrity to abide rules, with eyes watching or none. <br /><br />

                        One of the safety rules in the community that
citizens always ignore is the traffic lights rule. Most of the people don't
heed the traffic lights signal because of lots of reasons, they maybe in a
hurry or no officers' are watching so no one's gonna get caught or simply
because it's more fun to cross the street seemingly chasing the cars. Chasing
those vehicles provides thrill and excitement for those who are adventurous
people and always, this practice leads them to trouble and even worst
unfortunate events such as fatal accidents. People should stop risking
something precious especially their lives for fleeting pleasure such as
excitement or thrill because our life is worth more than that. We should know
where to find pleasure and how to find it in the safest way possible and surely
it's not found in chasing cars in the busy streets of the metropolis.

When their basic safety needs aren't met, children are at risk for not feeling comfortable at school and may stop showing up, or they may remain on edge throughout the day. Promoting school safety creates an open space for kids to explore, learn and grow.<br /><br />Keeping Children Safe at School<br /><br />A safe learning environment is essential for students of all ages. Without it they are unable to focus on learning the skills needed for a successful education and future. When violence is part of the educational setting, all students are affected in some way. Even though your child may not be the actual victim of violence in school, there is a very good chance that he or she will witness violent acts throughout the educational years. Research continues to illustrate children who feel unsafe at school perform worse academically and are more at risk for getting involved in drugs and delinquency.<br /><br />The issue of school safety is a major concern at all levels of government, from local to federal. School boards meet with teachers and parents to listen to their concerns and suggest solutions. State and federal governments are taking steps to improve school safety and law enforcement as the nation realizes the importance of this issue and how it impacts children's futures.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
