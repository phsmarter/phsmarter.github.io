                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Forced to make a choice, it is much better to be feared than loved. This is because men, by nature, are “ungrateful, fickle, dissembling, anxious to flee danger, and covetous of gain.” In times of remote danger, they are willing to take risks for their prince, but if the danger is real, they turn against their prince.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sorry kung mali</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Agree with me lol</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>My instinctive response: Love trumps fear. But the more I think about it, the more I wonder whether a good leader needs to/should be loved or feared to thrive at all.</p><p></p><p>To me, a good leader is respectable and respectful. A motivator with a vision that transcends themselves. A good leader prioritizes his or her people, establishes trusting relationships with them and empowers them to fulfill their own goals along the way. </p><p></p><p></p><br />

An organization's success or failure can depend entirely on how well or poorly a leader does their job.</p><p></p><p>For a <strong>leader</strong>,<strong> love</strong> is a risky emotion. It is quite inconsistent and erratic. For years, people may worship you, but when you do something they don't like, they start brandishing their pitchforks. The gravity holding things together is insufficient. Because effective leadership<strong> </strong>necessitates giving and receiving constructive criticism, it can also result in a personality cult that might undermine the foundation you are trying to build.</p><p></p><p>However,<strong> fear</strong> is worse. At first glance, it appears to be the stronger glue. Unfortunately, the thing with <strong>fear</strong> is that you typically do something to cause it. And your actions frequently create adversaries. One day, you'll cause someone to<strong> fear </strong>you more than the thing they <strong>love</strong>. and they're going to charge you for it.<strong> Fear</strong>-based leadership entails always looking behind you for the cloaked assailant. Knowing that no one will shed tears for your loss</p><p></p><p>I believe a <strong>leader</strong> shouldn't look for either <strong>love</strong> or <strong>fear</strong>. If a <strong>leader </strong>wants to be genuinely effective and stable, they should put more emphasis on <strong>respect</strong>. In my opinion, <strong>respect</strong> is the strongest adhesive because it must be earned. It depends on your behavior rather than your charisma, making it simpler to acquire and more difficult to lose than<strong> love</strong>.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Learn more about the related topic by visiting the link below:</strong></p><p>brainly.ph/question/1049663</p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        about FEAR<br />Fear is a part of life. It is part of the range of feelings that humans experience on a daily basis. In our culture, fear has come to be experienced as negative. However, the truth is that fear is a perfectly normal feeling to experience and we would all feel a lot better if we simply allowed ourselves to feel it fully. If we do not we will have somatic symptoms of fear that are much more painful than simply allowing the feeling to be felt<br /><br />about LOVE<br />omantic relationships are the spice of life, they make us feel alive in a way that nothing else can. Genuine romance exists when two people show that they care for each other through small acts of love and affection. We feel loved and cared for when we know that our significant other is thinking about how to give us the most pleasure. Romance is the key to keeping the sparks flying. Without it, any relationship will soon lose its shine.<br /><br />about DEATH<br /><br />ince the beginning of time, humans have lived their sometimes grand and sometimes ordinary lives, and have thereafter been laid to rest in countless graves and tombs. Death is something that, in a peculiar way, unites people everywhere, regardless of their social status, race, religious beliefs, or country of residence. This curious aspect of human nature inspired countless famous poets to contemplate, and write about, man's mortality.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

                            14. In what way did king acricius show he feared more for his life than he loved his daughter</h2><br />
                        <p>Since King Acrisius was told by the Oracle of Delphi that he will never father a son, and the son of his daughter will kill him , the King showed fear for his life than he loved his daughter by ensuring that Danae would never have children.  He shut and guarded her in a house built of bronze and sunk underground. He hoped that in this way, he would not have to kill her and thus would spare his own life.</p><br />

                            15. 2. Issue: Who is a better leader: Someone who is loved or someone who is feared?Evidence​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If someone was loved or feared, it depends but for my opinion, i pick feared. a leader should be brave because if i pick loved, that person wants to be loved instead of leading the people.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>And here comes in the question whether it is better to be loved rather than feared or feared rather than loved. It might perhaps be answered that we should wish to be both; but since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved.”</p><p></p><p>“Love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.” – Niccolo Machiavelli in The Prince Chapter XVII</p><p></p><p>Before delving deeper into what makes a better leader, let’s first ask the question: What is generally considered as “better”? Is it the achievement of productivity goals? Or is it focusing on the wellbeing of its stakeholders despite the end results?</p><p></p><p>The 15th century political theorist Machiavelli believed that a leader must be feared but not hated if he could not be both feared and loved. A natural cynic of human nature, he viewed people as fickle and unreliable, only willing to help when danger is distant. His infamous work The Prince would influence the likes of Hitler and Stalin who utilized fear as their greatest weapon in bringing about the imperilment of the masses.</p><p></p><p>You could say that Machiavelli idealized the philosophy that “the ends justify the means”; hence, as long as the state is thriving and order is in place, then morally ambiguous methods to achieve this goal are justifiable. Critics would argue that as policies in effect of this idealism may infringe upon human rights, the idea alone is unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, prominent leaders in history such as Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi were loved by their peers and respected for their will while their messages still speak out to the masses up to this day. Taking these comparisons at face value, both love and fear clearly appear to be effective motivators of human nature. Therefore, how can we determine whether one is more effective than the other?</p><p></p><p>The focus on individualism has been emphasized in the modern age, prioritizing the basic human rights of society and its members. If modern business corporations would utilize fear to instill discipline on its workers, overstepping certain boundaries may count as an entrenchment of human rights which would negatively impact the corporation’s reputation and operations. Being loved, on the other hand, may be misconstrued as a weakness that could be exploited.</p><p></p><p>Despite Machiavelli’s cynical views on humanity, I find that his outlooks on a leader contradict those of the human being. If the latter could be capable of trust and betrayal, and thus be unpredictable, how could a leader only assume the trait of a singular faction? It paints the leader to be entirely one-dimensional without considering the idiosyncrasies of the human entity. It is true that the ideal leader must be both feared and loved; however, the extremities of either should not be present in an effective leader.</p><p></p><p>If we ask ourselves what makes the two motivators so effective, the common ground would be a sense of respect. Let’s say there’s a school project and one has been assigned as a leader. The leader sets up strict deadlines for each member and enforces a rule that non-compliance would be taken to the facilitator; therefore, a member learns to fear the implications of not cooperating. If the leader is able to effectively enforce discipline in achieving their goal, this will beget respect from the members. On the other hand, a loved leader may be one who gives consideration to the members, acknowledging issues that the members themselves cannot control. With this, the members feel as if they are heard, urging them to respect their leader and comply to the best of their ability.</p><p></p><p>A leader must be able to perform a variety of roles and wear the appropriate hats for certain situations. He/she cannot be limited or kept in a box as what Machiavelli points out. While a loved leader is admired and respected by all, fear balances this out by intimidating those who step out of line by enforcing discipline and order. Therefore, a “better” leader is able to accomplish his/her goals, but not at the expense of his/her members. He/she must acknowledge that the goal must include the wellbeing of his/her subordinates.</p><p></p><p>Thus, to answer the question: the better leader is one who is multifaceted, intuitive, and able to adapt to any situation. He/she must know when to be feared and when to be loved.</p><br />

However, the oracle that was delivered to him was that he will be killed by his own grandson. Afraid of this, he imprisoned his then childless and unmarried daughter in a high tower where no man can ever enter. However, Zeus, the God of the Sky, had taken a liking to Danae.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Niccolò Machiavelli was a political theorist from the Renaissance period. In his most notable work, The Prince, he writes, "It is better to be feared than to be loved, if one cannot be both." He argues that fear is a better motivator than love, which is why it is the more effective tool for leaders.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sana po maka help.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Whichever leadership style you choose, team members and employees thrive when they feel valued.  They cannot feel valued when they are ruled with fear.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>When a person of authority is genuine, he/she will naturally attract like minds.  You get what you give. And the best part is, respectfully sincere, frank and forthright behavior  has a habit of spreading.</p><p></p><p>This lesson is a focal point of the book.  The book centers on the adventures of two tigers, Kali and Ashoka – two leaders who have the same goals and similarly-abled tribe members, yet one seemed to govern better than the other.  One was loved and respected.  The other was feared and hated. Why is there even a difference?  And why won’t the “hated” leader simply change his management style?</p><p></p><p>The captivating story may be one filled with wild animals, but the parallelism to real life is remarkable.  We do have leaders who lead by fear as much as leaders who lead by being loved and respected.  One could always argue, “whatever works”.  But then… for how long?  And what consequences does fear bring when the going gets tough? Will your team members be in the trenches with you?
