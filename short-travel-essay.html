                                            Argumentative Essay Wooden-hulled pump boats were given an extension to continue plying Iloilo- Guimaras Strait until December, 2020 after the Certificate of Public Convenience expired in September. As we all know, wooden-hulled boats is the easiest transportation where fare is affordable for everyone, local or foreign commuters, and travel time is as short as 15 to 20 minutes only. For decades, these boats have served thousands of people from all walks of life from all parts of the world and has aided in boosting the province's economy. Having these wooden-hulled boats nowhere in the wharves of Guimaras - Jordan and Buenavista, the province will never be the same.Questions:1. What is the topic all about?2.

Read the following narrative essay: 
Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!" He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.” (Source: http://examples.yourdictionary.com/narrative-essay-examples.html#eJbghHSKyA7cV5Mm.99)

Read the following narrative essay: 
I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

 If you have ever climbed a mountain, you know how exciting it is to realize you are about to get on top of one of the world’s roofs! Especially for the first time when you do not yet know what to expect or how it is going to be like.I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me. The Carpathian Mountains are not too high. If you compare them to, say, the Caucasian Mountains, the Carpathians look more like hills – although on average, they are about 4500 feet high. Anyways, this is more than enough for a novice, and I am glad my experience of climbing mountains started there.</a>

It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.

                                            He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein. The eaa which is in the shortest supply is called the ‘limiting’ amino acid. In general, animal proteins tend to be high quality while vegetable proteins tend to be low quality. The exception is soy protein which is quite high quality. What is the strategy used in the development of the paragraph?Select one:a.Etymologyb.Connotationc.Comparisond.Intensive definitione.Contrastf.Extensive definitiong.DenotationCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 3Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Read the following excerpt from the short story, Dead Stars by Paz Marquez Benitez: Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

 If you have ever climbed a mountain, you know how exciting it is to realize you are about to get on top of one of the world’s roofs! Especially for the first time when you do not yet know what to expect or how it is going to be like.I can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me. The Carpathian Mountains are not too high. If you compare them to, say, the Caucasian Mountains, the Carpathians look more like hills – although on average, they are about 4500 feet high. Anyways, this is more than enough for a novice, and I am glad my experience of climbing mountains started there.</h2><br />

                            20. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

-Read the following excerpt from the short story, Dead Stars by Paz Marquez Benitez:  Alfredo remembered that period with a wonder not unmixed with shame. That was less than four years ago.

-Read the following example of a definition paragraph:  Soren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194).  What is the strategy used in the development of the paragraph?

Falling action is the part of a story where the consequences or changes of situation start to arise. Simile is the figurative speech that shows two things exactly the same. First person pertains to the main character of the story. This is commonly the first introduced character or subject from the story. Flashback is the process of reminiscing or looking back from the past. It is part of stories sometimes. Denotation means the literal and true meaning and definition of words. Objective description is fact-based writing or description. The word "Narration" was derived from the latin word, narrare. <br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>                                  Why Traveling Alone is a Great Idea</p><p></p><p>                They said that traveling is therapeutic. It can clear out your mind from negativities and stress. Traveling alone is a great idea because you are free to go wherever you want and do whatever you would like to do. When you are alone, you don't have somebody to compromise with and no baggage to deal with. If you are alone, you can decide for yourself and you can take charge of your money well. One can even make friends while traveling especially if you chose to stay on an island and go resort or bar hopping. If your purpose is to find yourself and purpose, then being alone is  a perfect idea. You will have all the moment to yourself. You will be able to meditate and reflect on what's going with your life. Who knows, while doing it, you can find the answers and solutions to your problems or find the one that you've been looking for. </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
