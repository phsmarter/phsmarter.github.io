                                            Every Filipina is a source of endless possibilities. Her person embraces
the roles of responsible daughter, steadfast sister, generous aunt, indifferent
employee, consistent ex-lover, bill settler, a person who knows exactly how-to
uncomplicated matters for each member of the family; yet, she knows not how
to identify what she has long wanted for herself. She may have won the battle
against men for equal opportunity; but she has lost and forgotten the spirit that
drove her to win the battle. She can hardly recognize herself, perhaps, who
she had been, as an individual who once had an underrated self-image. But
declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair inthe formerly man’s world then needs disambiguation. Did she fight for selfactualization because she wanted to pursue a career in the field of her choiceor, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple its
function? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter.Perhaps she thinks of herself as messiah, and uses the same strength andfreedom that she has acquired from her battle for equality to save and rescueher family. She has become indifferent to her needs again- caged, caged inher pretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwaveringconfidence; she uses her resources and takes responsibility of her family; sheexercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; she works hardfor others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginably powerful person, who does everything she can possibly think ofand defies anyone who challenges her otherwise.She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself.She has enough compassion for her family; yet, she has not left any forherself.

Textbook Lesson 3: The learner understands the human person as an embodied spirit REFLECTION: Take some time to look at your body in front of the mirror. Identify those parts you like most about your body. Identify those parts you hate the most. Write everything down in a tabulated form. One column for likes, another for dislikes. Now focus on the column of dislikes. For each item you write, focus on the things that you won't be able to do or miss if that body part is lost, destroyed or severely injured. Write at least one down for each body part you dislike. Going back to the same column of dislikes, think of your many achievements and ask your self whether or not it was possible to achieve those if the body parts you dislike were injured or permanently destroyed. Finally, think of all your dreams and aspirations. Ask your self if it is possible to achieve those dreams and aspirations if your disliked body part were injured or permanently destroyed. After asking your self these questions, write a long letter in a paper of reconciliation addressing your body expressing everything you fell about it.​</a>

Identify those parts you like most about your body. Identify those parts you hate the most. Write everything down in a tabulated form. One column for likes, another for dislikes. Now focus on the column of dislikes. For each item you write, focus on the things that you won't be able to do or miss if that body part is lost, destroyed or severely injured. Write at least one down for each body part you dislike. Going back to the same column of dislikes, think of your many achievements and ask your self whether or not it was possible to achieve those if the body parts you dislike were injured or permanently destroyed. Finally, think of all your dreams and aspirations. Ask your self if it is possible to achieve those dreams and aspirations if your disliked body part were injured or permanently destroyed. After asking your self these questions, write a long letter in a paper of reconciliation addressing your body expressing everything you fell about it.​</a>

                            1. Make a Reflection Paper about the Dangers of Too much Self-Love</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Narcissism is a term that has been thrown around a lot lately. We are often told that in order to love others we must love ourselves. While this may be true, you must be careful not to take it too far, as the dangers of too much narcissism are harmful. . Confidence and self-esteem are important, but too much narcissism can lead to unhealthy self-centered narcissism. This can neglect others and make them feel unimportant and unappreciated. No one likes a selfish person and this type of behavior can cause you to lose friends and relationships and alienate you from the world.Too much narcissism can also narrow your horizons. Individuals begin to think only of themselves and are indifferent to their surroundings. They begin to show their superiority over others, forgetting that their goals and aspirations are related to those of others. They become self-centered and self-centered, and their mindset changes from contributing to society to benefiting only themselves. These unhealthy behaviors can lead to anger, loneliness, and isolation. Another danger of excessive narcissism is its ability to hide the truth. It's important to have a positive outlook on life, but too much narcissism can cause you to think of yourself as the center of the universe and that everything around you is influenced by you. These thoughts can be misleading and lead to a lack of understanding that can be harmful.In conclusion, self-love is an important aspect of human growth and development, but it is important to balance it with humility and compassion. If a person's self-esteem is too high, he thinks only of himself, ignores others and starts to cause conflicts. Therefore, it is very important to have a healthy attitude towards self-love so that we do not harm ourselves and those around us.<p></p><br />

                            7. Every Filipina is a source of endless possibilities. Her person embraces
the roles of responsible daughter, steadfast sister, generous aunt, indifferent
employee, consistent ex-lover, bill settler, a person who knows exactly how-to
uncomplicated matters for each member of the family; yet, she knows not how
to identify what she has long wanted for herself. She may have won the battle
against men for equal opportunity; but she has lost and forgotten the spirit that
drove her to win the battle. She can hardly recognize herself, perhaps, who
she had been, as an individual who once had an underrated self-image. But
declining economy remains clear to her.Now, her true objective in her display of deliberate obsession to fair inthe formerly man’s world then needs disambiguation. Did she fight for selfactualization because she wanted to pursue a career in the field of her choiceor, did she fight for the inadequacies of men in her family that cripple its
function? Her present actions seemingly prove her presence for the latter.Perhaps she thinks of herself as messiah, and uses the same strength andfreedom that she has acquired from her battle for equality to save and rescueher family. She has become indifferent to her needs again- caged, caged inher pretense. She flaunts her strength, her talents, her unwaveringconfidence; she uses her resources and takes responsibility of her family; sheexercises her freedom to penetrate fields she can be good at; she works hardfor others and forgets about her own self, again. She has turned into an unimaginably powerful person, who does everything she can possibly think ofand defies anyone who challenges her otherwise.She is the spirit who overshadows even the real person within herself.She has enough compassion for her family; yet, she has not left any forherself.

But take it from us: Fitness modeling jobs are highly competitive, demand absolute discipline, and are hard to come by—so even an ultra-fit dude could go months without booking a campaign. Signing on with a talent agency ups your chances of getting work—one example is Sports + Lifestyle Unlimited (which has offices in the fitness-industry hubs of Portland, Oregon and Los Angeles). And you don’t need us to tell you that getting magazine-worthy abs is no easy feat. </p><br />
