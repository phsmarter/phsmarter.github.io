                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Industrial arts is an educational program which features fabrication of objects in wood or metal using a variety of hand, power, or machine tools. Industrial Arts is commonly referred to as Technology Education. It may include small engine repair and automobile maintenance, and all programs usually cover technical drawing as part of the curricula. As an educational term, industrial arts dates from 1904 when Charles R. Richards of Teachers College, Columbia University, New York suggested it to replace manual training.<p></p>In the United States, industrial arts classes are colloquially known as "shop class"; these programs expose children to the basics of home repair, manual craftsmanship, and machine safety. Most industrial arts programs were established in comprehensive rather than dedicated vocational schools and focused on a broad range of skills rather than on a specific vocational training. In 1980, the name of industrial arts education in New York State was changed to "technology education" during what was called the "Figuring Project". The project goal was to increase students' technological literacy.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PA BRENLEST PO TYSM</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Industrial Arts is defined as the study of the skills needed to work with tools and machinery.</p><p>WELDING</p><p></p><p>Welding is an essential component of many industries such as the automotive industry, the construction industry, the aviation industry, and more. Without this form of metal work, so many things, including many buildings, gates, and fences, small kitchen appliances, vehicles - and even space travel - would not exist.</p><p>From cars to planes and bridges to buildings, welding keeps our economy moving. It's the backbone of our world. While we don't always notice every weld under the hood or behind the walls, welding plays an integral role in keeping people safe and advancing our quality of life.</p><p></p><p>&lt;3</p><br />
