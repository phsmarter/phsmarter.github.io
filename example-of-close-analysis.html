Early stages of developing fish and human both have gill slits. In fish they develop into gills, but in humans they disappear before birth.8.

The human arm is composed of the same set of bones just as the arms of lizard but may not have the same function.10.	Penguins and fish have fin-like structures to help them navigate through their aquatic environments.​</a>

                        1. The correct answer is D. DNA analysis. <p>DNA analysis can provide information about the genetic similarity between different species or populations, which can help to determine their evolutionary relationships and whether they share a common ancestor. Antennae and wings structure, habitat distribution, and life span can provide some information about the ecological and physical characteristics of the species, but they are not as direct or reliable indicators of evolutionary relationships as DNA analysis.</p><p></p>2.  The correct answer is C. III only. <p>I is incorrect because analogous structures are structures that are similar in function but not in structure. </p><p></p><p>II is incorrect because homologous structures have a similar genetic origin but may have different functions.</p><p></p><p>III is correct because the arm of a human and the foreleg of a cat have a similar bone structure and are considered homologous structures. </p><p></p><p>IV is incorrect because the wings of a bird and butterfly have different structures and different genetic origins, but have evolved to have a similar function of flight.</p><p></p>3. B. In struggle for existence, <p>the fittest would survive is NOT a principle of Lamarck's theory of evolution. This is actually a principle of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.
