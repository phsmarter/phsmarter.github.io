                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The statement is incorrect. Listening is an essential skill that is beneficial both in the classroom and in the workplace, as it helps us to more effectively interact with and understand others. Working on listening in the classroom can help to develop active listening skills which can then be used in day-to-day social interactions, such as conversations with friends, family and colleagues. Listening requires attention and focus, so it is important that students are aware of the importance of this practice and are given the opportunity to hone their listening skills both in the classroom and outside of it.</p><br />
