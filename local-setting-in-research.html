Choose the most appropriate explanation to the meaning of the following quotation on qualitative research.
“The worse thing that contemporary qualitative research can imply is that, in this post-modern age, anything goes. The trick is to produce intelligent, disciplined work on the very edge of the abyss.” ― David Silverman
Select one:
a.
The unique capabilities of online and mobile qualitative research can be under modern category and they are very much useful in qualitative research.
b.
Qualitative research is everyday life research. The issues to be addressed are in the beautiful places where problems are least expected to arise such as home, school, church, tourist spots, etc.
c.
The importance of context and meaning are the reasons to get the depth of explorations in qualitative research. The setting of the problem and multiple ways to get data from the locale will surely help the researcher to explain the unexplainable.
d.
The messy analysis and inductive approach is the qualitative characteristic describe in this quotation. It involves multilayered process which may include anything but the inductive approach will shape the result into an intelligent and disciplined work that will really make a difference.
e.
The flexible design of qualitative research is illustrated in the quotation since it can be modified from modern to conservative or vice-versa depending on the need of the study. The skill set required of the researcher is the key to interpret unpredictable findings.</a>

On the other hand, write capital w if the statement describes theweaknesses of qualitative research.1. Basically, its strengths are its capacity to give rich information about therespondents.2. Provide in-depth information on individual cases.3. Unravels complex phenomena embedded in local context.4. Data gathering is often time-consuming.5. Relays subject's experiences and perspectives in unusual details.6. Interpretation of results is usually biased because it is influenced by theresearcher's perspective.7. Conclusions are not generalizable because the subject are few and sometimespossess unique characteristics compared to typical respondents.8. Determines possible causes of a particular event in another perspective asthat given by quantitative research.9. Permits approaches that are responsive to local conditions and stakeholdersneed.10. Presents several options in the conduct of the research.11. Tolerates shifts in focus based on research results.12. Describe rich phenomena situated in some exceptional environments.13. Analysis of data takes longer than that in quantitative research.14. Allows flexibility in research-related processes.15. Enables data to be collected in natural setting.​</a>

Choose the most appropriate explanation to the meaning of the following quotation on qualitative research.
“The worse thing that contemporary qualitative research can imply is that, in this post-modern age, anything goes. The trick is to produce intelligent, disciplined work on the very edge of the abyss.” ― David Silverman
Select one:
a.
The unique capabilities of online and mobile qualitative research can be under modern category and they are very much useful in qualitative research.
b.
Qualitative research is everyday life research. The issues to be addressed are in the beautiful places where problems are least expected to arise such as home, school, church, tourist spots, etc.
c.
The importance of context and meaning are the reasons to get the depth of explorations in qualitative research. The setting of the problem and multiple ways to get data from the locale will surely help the researcher to explain the unexplainable.
d.
The messy analysis and inductive approach is the qualitative characteristic describe in this quotation. It involves multilayered process which may include anything but the inductive approach will shape the result into an intelligent and disciplined work that will really make a difference.
e.
The flexible design of qualitative research is illustrated in the quotation since it can be modified from modern to conservative or vice-versa depending on the need of the study. The skill set required of the researcher is the key to interpret unpredictable findings.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p> Key PointsThe first step of the scientific method is to ask a question, describe a problem, and identify the specific area of interest. The topic should be narrow enough to study within the context of a particular test but also broad enough to have a more general practical or theoretical merit.For many sociologists, the goal is to conduct research which may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro level to the macro level.Like other sciences, sociology relies on the systematic, careful collection of measurements or counts of relevant quantities to be considered valid. Given that sociology deals with topics that are often difficult to measure, this generally involves operationalizing relevant terms.<p></p>Key Termsoperational definition: A showing of something — such as a variable, term, or object — in terms of the specific process or set of validation tests used to determine its presence and quantity.operationalization: In humanities, operationalization is the process of defining a fuzzy concept so as to make the concept clearly distinguishable or measurable and to understand it in terms of empirical observations.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>hope it's help pa brainliest po pls <br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Rationale: The high school experience can be a challenging time for students as they navigate academic, social, and emotional demands. In recent years, there has been an increasing concern about the mental health and well-being of high school students, with studies indicating high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression among this population. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the educational landscape, exacerbating existing challenges and creating new ones. While there have been studies on the experiences of high school students, there is a need for more specific research that focuses on their coping strategies. This study aims to explore the experiences and coping strategies of senior high school students in order to provide insights that can inform interventions and support systems for this population.</p><p></p><p>Setting: The study will be conducted in senior high schools in [insert location], which is a diverse urban area with a mix of public and private schools. The schools were selected based on their willingness to participate in the study, as well as their diversity in terms of student population, academic performance, and socio-economic status.</p><p></p><p>Terms/variables: The experiences of senior high school students will be explored, including their academic and social experiences, as well as their stressors and challenges. Coping strategies will also be investigated, which can include a range of behaviors and attitudes such as seeking support from family and friends, engaging in physical activity, and using social media. It is important to define and clarify these concepts to ensure consistency in the study and to avoid confusion or misinterpretation of results.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
