Because of poverty, individuals go through their whole time on earth without first items. A poor is a powerless individual who neither can address his issues nor his family.

                            11. Speech about COVID-19 pandemic/impact(300 words)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>in the world we are in a fight of our lives against the coronavirus. It has affected many people including myself. I'm now at home every day and it really is affecting me socially. Not being able to speak to friends and see people I see on a regular basis is hard for me. Also, now that school is closed for the rest of the year it has really had an effect on my school life. I am not used to being at home all the time and working on the computer. I'm usually in a classroom surrounded by my peers. However, I am human so I will learn to adapt, but for now it is hard.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>It has affected me personally in the social and educational aspect, but I know around the city of Detroit it's affecting others as well. In Detroit, which is one of the cities around the country hit hard by the virus, the pandemic has also affected the youth. Youth are now forced to stay home instead of going to school and spending time with friends. Most kids need to be outside and with people to release their energy and socialize. Now this cannot happen, because the virus has affected us so much. One thing we also see happening is food insecurities and social distancing. Due to what is happening in the world, people are very much afraid and cautious about food supply and interactions with people. People are afraid and are told to stay inside, so we stock up supplies that will last them about a month. Usually people get stuff that we will last them about two weeks, but now we need to stay home as much as we can.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>With social distancing, we now separate ourselves from other parts of society. This has made me feel very much disconnected from my friends. Humans are made to be out and about and socialize with beings on Earth. These unfortunate events have led many people to be disconnected from society. This has allowed my mind to go to the dark side, where my fears come out. My main fear is “How long will my life be on pause?” I’m afraid of how long I will be stuck in the house and can’t see my friends. Will it be a couple more weeks or will it be a couple months?</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>The Boys &amp; Girls Club has helped me a lot during this crisis. Just for a couple hours, I’m able to forget about the real world and have a good time. This is because the club has come to us. The Virtual Club has helped me still talk to people and meet new people as well. BGCSM has helped me through a lot of things in my life these past few years. So, I know for sure it helps other kids through these tough times. This experience with BGCSM virtually is helping lighten my heart, through my darkest time</p><br />

                            12. Positive and negative trait or characteristics personality of pilipinos 100 to 300 word speech​</h2><br />
                        <br />Positive Traits:<br />1. Hospitality - Filipinos are known for their warm and welcoming nature, making them some of the most hospitable people in the world.<br />2. Strong Family Ties - Filipinos place a great emphasis on family and the bonds that tie them together.<br />3. Resilience - Despite facing numerous challenges, Filipinos have shown time and again that they are resilient and can overcome adversity.<br />4. Creativity - Filipinos are known for their creativity and ingenuity, especially in the arts and entertainment industry.<br />5. Faith and Spirituality - Religion plays a significant role in the lives of many Filipinos, with a majority of the population being Roman Catholic.<br /><br />Negative Traits:<br />1. Crab Mentality - Filipinos are sometimes known for their tendency to pull others down, especially those who succeed or achieve more than them.<br />2. Lack of Discipline - The Philippine culture is sometimes criticized for being lax in rules and discipline.<br />3. Colonial Mentality - Filipinos, due to their history of colonization, may sometimes have a mindset that favors foreign things over their own.<br />4. Procrastination - Filipinos may have a habit of putting things off until the last minute.<br />5. "Bahala Na" Attitude - Filipinos sometimes have a tendency to leave things to chance or fate instead of taking action and being proactive.<br /><br />These traits, both positive and negative, are not unique to Filipinos and are present in other cultures as well. It is important to recognize these traits and work on improving ourselves while celebrating the positive aspects of our culture.<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Filipinos are known for their unique personality and characteristics that make them stand out from the rest of the world. As with any culture, Filipinos have both positive and negative traits that have been shaped by their history, traditions, and environment. In this speech, I will discuss some of the positive and negative personality traits of Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>Let’s start with the positive traits. Filipinos are known for their hospitality, warmth, and friendliness. They have a strong sense of family and community, and are always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. This trait is deeply ingrained in Filipino culture, and is evident in the way they treat guests and strangers alike. Filipinos are also known for their resilience and determination, especially in times of adversity. They have a strong sense of faith and optimism, and believe that things will always work out in the end.</p><p></p><p>However, Filipinos also have some negative traits that they need to work on. One of the most prominent negative traits is “crab mentality”, which refers to the tendency of some Filipinos to pull down others who are succeeding or doing well in life. This trait is often driven by jealousy or insecurity, and can be detrimental to both the individual and the community. Another negative trait is “mañana habit”, which refers to the tendency to procrastinate or put off tasks until the last minute. This trait can lead to missed opportunities and a lack of productivity.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Filipinos can be too passive or non-confrontational when it comes to addressing issues or problems. They may avoid conflicts or difficult conversations, which can lead to misunderstandings or unaddressed concerns. This trait can also be detrimental to personal growth and development.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Filipinos have both positive and negative personality traits that shape their behavior and interactions with others. While their hospitality, resilience, and determination are admirable traits, they must also work on addressing negative traits such as crab mentality, mañana habit, and non-confrontation. By recognizing and addressing these negative traits, Filipinos can continue to build on their positive traits and make progress towards personal and societal growth.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>A broken family is a family that is not together and often has parents who are separated or divorced. It can be a difficult and challenging situation for children who have to navigate the complexities of a family that is no longer whole.</p><p></p><p>One of the most challenging aspects of a broken family is the feeling of loneliness. Children may feel alone, abandoned, or unloved, which can lead to feelings of sadness and depression. They may also feel angry, confused, and frustrated as they try to make sense of the changes happening around them.</p><p></p><p>In addition, a broken family can lead to financial difficulties, as one parent may be left to support the family on their own. This can lead to stress and strain on the family, as they struggle to make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>Despite these challenges, there are many positive things that can come out of a broken family. For example, children may become more independent and self-sufficient, as they learn to take care of themselves and their siblings. They may also develop strong bonds with other family members, such as grandparents or aunts and uncles.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, a broken family can be a difficult and challenging situation for children. However, with love, support, and perseverance, they can overcome these challenges and thrive.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>What the adjective words in the essay? </p><p></p><p>The adjectives used in the essay are:</p><p></p><p>difficult</p><p>challenging</p><p>whole</p><p>lonely</p><p>abandoned</p><p>unloved</p><p>sad</p><p>depressed</p><p>angry</p><p>confused</p><p>frustrated</p><p>positive</p><p>independent</p><p>self-sufficient</p><p>strong</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

The flame roasting, the snow coming, the music action,</strong></p><p><strong>it's all so wonderful, gorgeous, and brilliant. I like Christmas could happen soon each</strong></p><p><strong>Difficult to contend with thing about Christmas, because still people who charge that it's one faith's day</strong></p><p><strong>have no trouble getting to Yule parties, consuming Christmas dinners, listening to Christmas music and,</strong></p><p><strong>oh yeah, getting Christmas presents. Apart from this Super Bowl, it's actually the only better thing of</strong></p><p><strong>season, and might get the best position if you didn''t get to deal with the trauma that is December at the</strong></p><p><strong>mall. If there's one thing this earth recognizes America for, it's consuming. And no time do we eat with less</strong></p><p><strong>feeling than prayer, where we inexplicably spend " meal " around 3pm and get into the food coma while</strong></p><p><strong>watching the city Lions lose for the rest of the afternoon. It's likewise that one day where people move</strong></p><p><strong>their houses to families they just remember, demonstrating that even though we're overworked, stressed-</strong></p><p><strong>out, and just go like six days off a year, we're still thankful we don''t live in Spain.</strong></p><p><strong>In Denmark we're important about this counting to Christmas day. Yes, day. Danish Christmas is on this</strong></p><p><strong>Eve of this 24th. (Wiegand, C., Dec. 2017) yet</strong></p><p><strong>Some of our traditions are only this; traditions for no different cause than to inform us it is Christmas time.</strong></p><p><strong>It couldn't take Christmas without the ham for dinner, or without rotten nut pie for sweet. These are only</strong></p><p><strong>entertaining small things that think Christmas is here. There is nothing extraordinary or important about</strong></p><p><strong>them; they only exist after so many years of discovering them.ar. I try to be diplomatic about most topics,</strong></p><p><strong>and I have attempted to remain tactful about the topic, but I can't. The day is also special and magical to</strong></p><p><strong>match with others. I am not offending people with different opinions, as I like grace, Holloween, freedom</strong></p><p><strong>time, New year's, and more, but I only think that Christmas tops over these holidays.</strong></p><p></p><br />

A child always needs the warmth and love of their parents. As we grow older, we learn to become more independent and do not need our parents as much. However, they are always there when we need them, and they will ever love us. As they grow older, they need our help and attention. Moving on with our lives and forgetting about them affects them, and they feel lonely. We need to be there for them the same way they were with us.</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Over 100 years have passed since these words were written, and yet the challenge to us, the Filipino youth, is as relevant as ever. As young adults on the quest of discovering who we are and who we are meant to be, the role of nation building has been firmly placed in our hands. Mentors from generations before have done their part in shaping the nation and are grooming us, the Filipino youth, to be the next change agents.
</p><p>
</p><p>In our short stay here, we have witnessed the tragic effects of our nation’s most lamentable social ills: the orchestrated misuse of government funds, the systemic violation of basic human rights, and the continuous loss of life and property due to abandonment and greed.
</p><p>
</p><p>Through all of these, it has become more and more apparent that our nation needs more Filipinos than citizens.It is easy to imbibe “Filipino Pride” in our moments of triumph – with every win of Manny Pacquiao, every article on the Philippines as the projected thriving economy of the next decade, and every tourist video espousing the natural beauty of our motherland.
</p><p>
</p><p>But being Filipino is much more than a celebration of our collective successes; it is also an inheritance of the not-so-beautiful aspects of this country: its culture of impunity, widespread poverty, and institutional corruption, among others.</p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><p></p><br />

Poverty is primarily a result of inequality and corruption, and not due to the number of people living in a certain area.</p><p></p><p>Inequality is a fundamental issue that results in a small group of people having the majority of resources and wealth, while the vast majority of people have little to no access to basic necessities like food, clean water, and healthcare. This inequality is perpetuated by systemic issues such as unequal distribution of resources, biased economic policies, and inadequate social safety nets. The wealthy have access to quality education and job opportunities while the poor are denied access to these essential tools. As a result, the cycle of poverty continues.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, corruption also plays a significant role in poverty. When people in power use their position to gain wealth and power for themselves, they are actively taking resources away from those in need. Corruption also leads to a lack of transparency and accountability, which means that resources meant to help the poor are often misused or stolen, leaving those in need without any aid.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it is crucial to recognize that overpopulation is not the main cause of poverty. While population growth can lead to increased strain on resources, it is not the root cause of poverty. Countries with high population densities such as Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong have managed to develop successful economies and provide their citizens with a high standard of living.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, poverty is a complex issue that cannot be solely attributed to overpopulation. It is caused by inequality and corruption, which perpetuate a vicious cycle of poverty. To eradicate poverty, we need to address these systemic issues and promote equitable distribution of resources and opportunities. We must also fight corruption and ensure that resources meant for the poor are not misused or stolen. It is time for us to come together and work towards a future where poverty is no longer a reality. Thank you.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Almost all theories of human development agree upon the fact that society is the key factor in the development of a human being. This is what teaches people to learn how the world is organized and structured by means of communication and provides them with the possibility to evaluate themselves through the perception of other individuals. However, I strongly disagree that society is the key factor in shaping a personality.<p></p>First, it starts influencing a person only after a certain age, usually when an individual is not younger than three, which means that the basis of the personality has already been shaped by the family. It means that the community will undoubtedly influence the character, values, and ideas of a person, but only up to a point where it will face the barrier of the values acquired in a family.<p></p>Further on, I firmly believe that any person has a definite set of inborn features and inclinations. If you try to observe even a very little baby, you will see that even at the youngest possible age, they possess their unique personality, being calm or active, stubborn or obedient, cautious or reckless. These features can be modified and changed slightly, but it is absolutely impossible to eliminate them completely.<p></p>So, despite the huge influence of society on the formation of a human being as a personality, the leading role still belongs to the family and nature. The person is born with a personality, and what we can do as teachers and parents is only adapt it slightly.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>@CarryonLearning<br />
