                            6. writing essay how do media literacy, information literacy and technology literacy and media and information literacy differ in terms of use​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Being “literate” in media use is in basic terms how much a person truly understands about the chosen form of media they most use. If you understand that news organizations do what’s called “agenda-setting” you know that the gatekeepers of those information outlets (whether in print or online) decide what kind of messages will be delivered even up to and including how the messages are structured. If you believe them to be impartial and don’t understand the context, you are not fully media literate.
</p><p>
</p><p>Information literacy is based on content analysis. How much of what the writer is trying to say do you understand? Think about all those tests you took as a kid for scores on “reading comprehension.” If you are very literate in your ability to analyze the meaning behind the information you receive you would possess a high degree of comprehension. In that case, distinguish between what is true and what is propaganda (as an example).
</p><p>
</p><p>Information technology is how information is managed using machine knowledge, algorithms, and software platforms that compute the information in manageable bits and bytes. It also includes the server technology and architecture infrastructure that allows different programs to communicate with each other even though some code may be wildly different across a platform. It isn’t related to communication theory in any way because it requires intervention by a third source and is generally seen as a mathematical construct.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This paper studies how the field of librarianship can help counteract the phenomenon of fake news and misinformation. A literature review was conducted to identify the current themes, patterns, correlations and gaps within the existing literature on fake news, information literacy and librarianship. Findings centre on defining fake news, analysing contemporary and emerging information literacy frameworks, and outlining the current efforts and initiatives exercised by libraries to refute the spread of fake news and educate communities on how to navigate through an era of untruth and disinformation. The paper outlines effective initiatives developed by those within the Library and Information Systems (LIS) profession while highlighting considerations and recommendations as to how librarians can continue to enhance their role in the digital age and make successful contributions to the professional field.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po thank you :)</p><br />

                            9. Essay about what is 
literacy</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Literacy is the process of learning whereby an individual gains the ability to understand and convey written information, gain new skills from the information, teach those skills and apply the acquired knowledge and skills for the benefit of the society. Here the key words are gain, ability to understand, teach, apply, and for a benefit. However, different people have defined literacy differently in different periods. Traditionally, people defined literacy as the ability to read, appropriately use written information and appropriately write in a range of contexts (Winch, 2007, p. 20). However, there have been new aspects arising from the definition.This definition does not involve critical thinking in the application of the information retrieved from the written sources. It remains insufficient since it does not account for several aspects that are significant as far as literacy is concerned.Most people perceive that literacy comprises of a set of several tangible skills, which include the cognitive skills of reading and writing. These skills ought to be independent of the context of acquiring them and the background of the individual who acquires them (Adams, 1993, p. 24). The individual should be able to decode phonetics, spelling, word recognition and vocabulary. This implies that one should not depend on pictures to denote meaning. There is emphasis on both the ability to understand orally given information and the ability to present it as written literature An addition to the contemporary definitions of literacy is that it should be a learning process in which, individuals continually acquire knowledge and skills and use those skills for the benefit of the society (Rogoff, 2003, p. 6). According to National Inquiry into the Teaching of Literacy, learning to read and the teaching of reading is usually included within the broader area of literacy (2005, p. 7). Therefore, the literacy learning system should focus on strategies that are investigative, reflective, tailored, tested, embedded, purposively practiced and shared</p><p>In conclusion, literacy includes gaining knowledge, being able to understand, to teach, to apply, and to use for a specific benefit. These aspects are equally important and therefore absence of either may translate to illiteracy. For this reason, when assessing literacy level, it is important to consider all the aspects. It applies in all fields.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For my reflective essay I am exploring the notion of 21st century skills as the key idea that relates to our class readings. The set of progressive qualities being examined applies to the skills needed to be a successful contributing member of an envisaged future society. Defining 21st century skills is an imprecise calculation of present day trends that make short term projections. Understanding the skills that will be needed in the future assists in developing a teaching curriculum that prepares students for the jobs of the future. We are in the beginning of the 21st century now and today we can see how jobs and industry have been changing because of advances in technology. The interesting element concerning teaching 21st century skills is that we are also entering into a new era of social change described as the Information Age, which changes the dynamics of previous models for teaching and learning.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I just search it and i also read it, soo hope its helps to u:)</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>An essay is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own argument — but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of a letter, a paper, an article, a pamphlet, and a short story. Essays have traditionally been sub-classified as formal and informal. Formal essays are characterized by "serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length," whereas the informal essay is characterized by "the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme," etc.[1]</p><p></p><p>Essays of Michel de Montaigne</p><p></p><p>Essays are commonly used as literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays (e.g., Alexander Pope's An Essay on Criticism and An Essay on Man). While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Thomas Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population are counterexamples.</p><p></p><p>In some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major part of formal education. Secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills; admission essays are often used by universities in selecting applicants, and in the humanities and social sciences essays are often used as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams.</p><p></p><p>The concept of an "essay" has been extended to other media beyond writing. A film essay is a movie that often incorporates documentary filmmaking styles and focuses more on the evolution of a theme or idea. A photographic essay covers a topic with a linked series of photographs that may have accompanying text or captions.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The word ‘literacy’ means an ability to read and write. In a civilized country, every citizen should learn how to read and write. If not, he is called an illiterate person. An illiterate person has to face many practical difficulties in life.</p><p></p><p>As he is unable to read or write, he cannot read a letter addressed to him by his near and dear ones. He cannot calculate his own income and expenses, nor can keep his own accounts. Morally and psychologically, he feels insecure and weak, and hence suffers from an inferiority complex.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, every person in the society should try to become literate. If it was not possible in an early age, a grown-up man can yet learn how to read and write in his advanced stage of life. Literacy will help him also in gaining common knowledge in various subjects, which will make him a “complete man.</p><p></p><p>An illiterate man is generally exploited by the clever men in the society. They take full advantage of his ignorance of the language or wisdom. The illiterate men become like dancing dolls at the hands of the clever persons. They suffer in many ways in life.</p><p></p><p>Now-a-days, the Indian governments have taken a litera­cy drive all over the country. They are sending teachers into the remote corners of the villages of India in order to educate the people, irrespective of their age or profession.</p><p></p><p>The programme of education has taken a bold step, and the results are encouraging. The students and the educated youth should come forward to join the literacy movement since launched by the government of India.</p><p></p><p>Classes can be held in a primary school or in any other suitable place that is available in the area chosen for literacy movement. Teaching can be arranged in the morning or in the evening.</p><p>The students may be peasants, mill workers, or traders, the poor or the rich. Education must be free and vol­untary. The students are to be supplied with the books, and taught first how to read them, and then, how to write the scripts, imitating the printed letters in the books.</p><p></p><p>It has been seen that the people of India have remark­ably responded to this drive, and shown great interest in adult education, apart from the education of the young ones.</p><p></p><p>The percentage of literate persons in India has considerably increased in comparison with the figures of the earlier years. It is found that in the villages, the young and the old men and women assemble and sit together to take lessons from the teachers who have been specially trained and appointed for the purpose of teaching the illiterate mass.</p><p></p><p>The students should also come forward voluntarily to actively participate in this noble literacy drive and make their country free from the curse of illiteracy.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The rise of the global COVID-19 pandemic has caused economic repercussions across the United States. Efforts to contain the spreading coronavirus have caused a surge in layoffs, resulting in the loss of jobs in a variety of industries, including restaurants, bars and entertainment venues, airlines, hotels, automakers and manufacturing. U.S. stocks saw their biggest weekly drop since the financial crisis of 2008. U.S. Department of Labor figures from late March showed that the record for the most new unemployment claims filed in a single week was shattered. Suddenly, there are more jobless Americans than during the Great Recession or in the aftermath of major natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires and floods. </p><p></p><p>There have been some attempts to alleviate the immediate problem, chiefly the $2 trillion economic stimulus bill (H.R. 748). In addition, the Federal Reserve, joined by other government agencies, has called on the financial services industry to meet the financial needs of people affected by COVID-19. Some of the country's largest financial institutions, including Citibank, Wells Fargo and American Express, have responded with measures to help their customers cope.</p><p></p><p>Another way to help American workers—now and in the future—is to improve their financial literacy. April is National Financial Literacy Month. To observe this during the current crisis may seem absurd or insensitive, but it is an opportune time to focus on the importance of employee financial education.</p><p></p><p>The Need to Improve Financial Literacy</p><p></p><p>More than 30 percent of the thousands of participants in a Charles Schwab assessment said they don't have a written financial plan because they think it's too complicated or they don't have enough time to work on one. More than 20 percent of people polled by the National Financial Educators Council said they don't have anyone to turn to for trusted financial guidance.</p><p></p><p>As a financial and HR professional, I believe that CHROs must forge partnerships with CFOs to improve the financial literacy of employees. I have seen many of these partnerships succeed. Organizations whose HR and finance functions work together to meet the growing demand for financial and compliance training can realize valuable returns on this investment in collaboration.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>In my opinion, information literacy is the comprehension of ideas and messages that are shared in whatever form they take — verbal, nonverbal, digital or analog. When you have the ability to grasp a concept or have studied a subject, you would be considered literate because you “get it.”</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>In my opinion, information literacy is the comprehension of ideas and messages that are shared in whatever form they take — verbal, nonverbal, digital or analog. When you have the ability to grasp a concept or have studied a subject, you would be considered literate because you “get it.”In technology, it’s a pretty similar process. On the surface, you either grasp the value of any given technological advancement and it’s benefits, or you don’t. If you are talking about anything specific about technology, say, that computers are networked, our phones work from wireless connections, or that the term “in the cloud” means electronic files stored on servers, etc. you would be considerably literate in your knowledge without being a developer or technologist.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>In my opinion, information literacy is the comprehension of ideas and messages that are shared in whatever form they take — verbal, nonverbal, digital or analog.

I’m literate enough to understand how cars operate, but I’m not a mechanic.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>In my opinion, information literacy is the comprehension of ideas and messages that are shared in whatever form they take — verbal, nonverbal, digital or analog.
