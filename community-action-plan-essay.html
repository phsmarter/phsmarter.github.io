The plan describes what the community wants to achieve, what activities are required during a specified time period, and what resources (money, people, and materials) are needed to be successful. A community action plan becomes a framework for implementing the activities that are decided by the community itself. What's the aim of community planning of social services? - It is a method how strengthening the social cohesion of the community. - It is a method how to support social inclusion and prevent social exclusion of individuals and groups.
