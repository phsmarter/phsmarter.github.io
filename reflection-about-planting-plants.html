                            2. reflection about method in planting?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>As Christian community developers, we can find ourselves wondering if the seeds we plant will ever poke their heads out of the ground. How long must we wait? Will we have to replant? Will we ever see evidence of our efforts? As a social justice activist, much of my life is spent planting seeds without much evidence of growth, placing hopes and ideals into proverbial dirt, hoping for fruit. As I have thought through activism and gardening’s intersection I have drawn the following correlations. We need:
</p><p>Timing – Timing is essential. Nothing is done on a whim. It takes time for plants to transition from a controlled environment to outside unpredictable elements. Regardless of what you cultivate independently, the time to stand up for community is not randomly chosen but carefully considered and approached sustainably.
</p><p>Spring Foundation – The strength of roots depend on the quality of the soil.  Jesus talks about the importance of soil enabling seeds to take root. In activism,  hearts need to be softened. Dirt that is packed down and rocky is not a place to sow seeds of substance. As we walk together toward shared liberation we can feel hardened, cynical or “rocky.” Foundations of faith and hope are essential to life and growth.
</p><p>Patience – Even with the perfect setting for a seed to take root, waiting is unavoidable. Under the surface, work is slow and unseen. It’s easy to get frustrated and impatient. Commitment to the process and patience sustains the life above. You have to learn to wait.
</p><p>Resilience – Last year, like every year, I began my seeds in an indoor greenhouse and waited until the threat of Colorado snow had passed before planting. After a month, a series of hail storms destroyed the small plants. Four months of efforts, gone. I’d have to wait until next year to begin again.
</p><p>There can be months of careful work and sometimes no product to show. I have been a part of community efforts that have succeeded and more that have “failed.” But, each time we come to a place of loss, we begin again.
</p><p>Rootedness – We need to remain planted and dig deeper roots within ourselves and each other. Strong, mature roots keep us planted and committed to the process of transormation regardless of what comes our way.
</p><p>As we focus our attention on this year’s conference theme: “Rooted,” I’d encourage us all to reflect on the seeds of hope we are planting. Think of the joys and disappointments that have yielded the fruits of our efforts along the way and take time to celebrate! Celebrate that regardless of what the year has brought, we can remain committed to join Christ’s call to work toward the restoration of our broken world. We will reap a harvest if we don’t give up. (Galatians 6:9)
</p><p>My personal activism journey has been driven by my front row seat to the process of what God is stirring in my community. I had no comprehension of how longevity would test my commitment to this journey, but I know that the work we share alongside our communities is process-driven and not product-driven.</p><p>The work of planting seeds has no guarantees, but there is always a choice to hope.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Plants provide us with food, fiber, shelter, medicine, and fuel. The basic food for all organisms is produced by green plants. In the process of food production, oxygen is released. This oxygen, which we obtain from the air we breathe, is essential to life.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>&lt;33</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Plants are really important for the planet and for all living things. Plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen from their leaves, which humans and other animals need to breathe. Living things need plants to live they eat them and live in them. Plants help to clean water too. Plants play a very important role in our lives. They make up a large part of our diet, as well as being used to make medicines, soaps, furniture, textiles, tyres and much more.

                        <p>When I was in school, one of the sure projects each batch had was to plant mongo seeds in a cup (or pot) and let it grow. Students were given similar mongo seeds to plant, water, and take care of to make it grow. After the specified time, student were asked to bring the seeds to school. Even though they were given same seeds, they ended up differently. Some looked healthy, some looked dry, while some did not survive at all. The teacher then explains that a lot of things affect the growth of the seeds - air, sunshine, soil, water, etc.</p><p></p><p>This is true with our faith as well. We have the same source, God, but we end up differently. A lot of things affect our growth, and some are beyond our control. But God just asks us to plant seeds, something we can all do. Share God to others. Tell of what he has done in our lives. Love others, especially the unlovable, the way we are loved by God.  Be fair and just with our dealings with others, even if we have the option not to. We just need to do our best, knowing that we cannot control a lot of things, so we just lift the rest to God.</p><p></p><p>Father God,</p><p>Thank you for today. Thank you for another day to live. Thank you for another day to rest and spend time with people important to me. Lord, I pray that I be a faithful sower. May i just do my best to plant seeds for your kingdom, and just trust in you, knowing that you will be the one to make the seeds grow and bear fruit for your kingdom. Amen.</p><p></p><p>Blessed day!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The cell is considered as the basic unit/machinery of life because all organisms are made of cells.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Planting trees is a learning environment because it provides healthy and beautiful places for children to play and learn. We can make it as a school project. By using tree planting, we can instill a sense of environmental awareness amongst youths or in school ages</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>We arrived ( I about thirty minutes late because i got lost trying to walk) early in the morning, grabbed a couple shovels and started digging.</p><p>Each student was to plant 4 small karamunting trees as a way to improve the environment by lessening carbon emissions we put out everyday via transport, improper disposal, and using technology. This experience taught students how to plant trees properly and how to make the difference.</p><p></p><p>What aspect caused you the most anxiety?</p><p>When I heard we would be planting four trees each I was anxious and a little disappointed but enjoyed getting dirty and taking some stress out with the very small shovel. I have planted things like flowers and small plants but not trees and i suppose I was intimidated by the the steep slope and tools. Seeing the tree successfully in the ground and knowing that it will grow tall like the others surrounding it is the ultimate highlight of my experience.</p><p></p><p>Was there any aspect of the experience that suprised you?</p><p>I was suprised to learn that the karamunting tree has become an endangered species and was relieved that the forestry department and the BEACA plecturers ares taking the initiative to rebuild the species quantity. Physically I was suprised at how quickly I was able to plant the trees. Planting a single tree involves hard work but once you get the hang of planting one tree, the rest aren't nearly as difficult.</p><p></p><p>What were the three most important things you learnt from the experience?</p><p>1. the proper way to plant a tree - including measurements and furtalizers.</p><p>2. That the karamunting tree is a part of the endangered species list and our efforts to help take this species off the list is a step toward a more stable environment.</p><p>3. 2 is only possible if the maintenance of the tree is taken care of.</p><p></p><p>Which aspects would you include in your future behavior based on your learnings from this experience?</p><p></p><p>Planting the trees felt good and I enjoy helping make our environment a better habitat for all. Therefore, if there are tree planting activities I am much more likely to participate. Next time though I would like to plant more than four trees. I now look at a tree differently- I find myself taking the time to think of the growth stages and have become to appreciate a tall healthy tree. It is unfrotunate that it takes so long for a tree to grow and then it's just cut down for quick scratch paper but thats the world we live in. It's fortunate however, that there are people who go out of their way to help the environment like the BEACA professors and lecturers in collaborating to raise awareness of environmental matters and show students how to make a difference.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe. Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding. Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and homes for many birds and mammals.</p><br />
