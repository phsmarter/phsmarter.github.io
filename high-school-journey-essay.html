It was a rollercoaster ride filled with ups and downs, challenges and triumphs, failures and successes. Nonetheless, I am grateful for the lessons and experiences that have molded me into the person that I am today.</p><p></p><p>My journey began with a lot of excitement and enthusiasm.

I struggled with some subjects, and I had to put in extra effort to keep up. There were times when I felt overwhelmed, especially during exam weeks, but I persevered and pushed through.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant lessons I learned was the importance of time management. Junior high school meant having more responsibilities and deadlines to meet. I had to juggle academics, extracurricular activities, and personal interests, which taught me the value of prioritizing and planning. It also allowed me to develop good habits that I still practice today.</p><p></p><p>Apart from academic pursuits, junior high school gave me the opportunity to explore various extracurricular activities. I joined the school band, participated in sports events, and even joined theater productions. These experiences not only allowed me to discover my interests and passions but also helped me develop my social skills and build lasting friendships.</p><p></p><p>As I approach the end of my junior high school journey, I am filled with a sense of pride and accomplishment. Despite the challenges and setbacks, I have grown in various aspects, and I am more confident and determined to take on new challenges that come my way.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, my journey as a junior high school student was not easy, but it was definitely worth it. It has taught me valuable life lessons, allowed me to discover my passions, and helped me develop my skills and talents.

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>My senior high school journey may not be easy especially the fact we are all affected amidst  the pandemic and to what is happening right now. Though we only meet our classmates and teachers virtually, at least I've got to know what kind of person they are based on what I only observed. Even there are a lot of circumstances each and everyone of us has faced, we still got to reach other peoples hand, understand their situations, and offer better solutions that may help them. By this, it made me a bit inspired and motivated to do all the modules by seeing them exerting efforts just to reach their dream career and future plans for their life and humanity. </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My journey as a junior high school student has been a time of growth, learning, and discovery. During these years, I have had the opportunity to explore new subjects, meet new people, and develop new skills that will serve me well throughout my life.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant changes I experienced during my junior high school years was the shift from a more general education to a more specialized curriculum. As I moved from grade school to junior high school, I had the opportunity to study subjects in greater depth, such as science, math, and English. This allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of these subjects and prepare for the more advanced coursework that awaits me in high school and beyond.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of my junior high school journey has been the opportunity to make new friends and expand my social circle. As I entered a new school with new classmates, I had the chance to meet people from different backgrounds and with different interests. This allowed me to broaden my perspective, learn from others, and develop important social skills that will serve me well throughout my life.</p><p></p><p>Finally, my journey as a junior high school student has been characterized by a commitment to personal growth and development. I have learned the importance of hard work, dedication, and perseverance in achieving my goals, whether that be acing a test or mastering a new skill. I have also learned the value of seeking help when needed, whether that be from teachers, mentors, or peers, and the importance of taking care of my physical and mental health.</p><p></p><p>Overall, my journey as a junior high school student has been a time of growth, learning, and development. I am grateful for the experiences and opportunities that have come my way during these years and look forward to continuing my journey as I move on to high school and beyond</p><br />

                            12. journey in life essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Each person’s life is a journey on a contorted road dotted with bumps and craters. At certain points, the bumps could seem as high as mountains and the pits as deep as lots, making this journey called life appear quite despondent. Although occasionally, your predicaments are entirely fate’s blunders, but perchance, they are your own. Your personal characteristics roughly resemble a steering wheel for your journey. They could be positive traits, which could steer you on a more decent path; or negative traits, which could steer you to a path that’s, well… not so decent. Although you have no control over fate, you have power over your own “driving skills”, and could thus widen or narrow your chance for a smooth, prosperous journey. Also, it is beneficial to remember that you are not alone, for there are many other roads that coincide with yours, where others are conducting through their own journeys and floundering through their own bumps and craters as well. Drive together, and you could purvey support and encouragement for one another, and thus institute milder paths for all of you. Most prominently, no matter how harsh the terrain of your road becomes, just remember that you will pull through and be transformed for the better because of it.</p><p></p><p>This optimistic philosophy that I’ve adopted had been much solace to me in my own journey in becoming a successful high school student. It was not at all easy. Although fate has been overall lenient to me, it was my “driving skills” that tended to direct my course towards huge bumps. Despite my awareness of my own flaws and omissions, I still compulsorily reproached others and sought ways to exonerate myself. This was one of the worst traits I retain. It precluded me from obtaining responsibility for my choices and learning from past oversights, thus impeded my maturing process. For example, my projects were oftentimes undone till the last minute (including this one). I would think to myself, “I don’t feel like doing it today, so I’ll work on it tomorrow”. Thus the project was delayed further and further until there was no “tomorrow” for it anymore, and then I would end up working well over midnight while secretly scowling at the teacher for giving out such a tedious and inane assignment. Immaturity and refusal to admit my errors caused me to plunge into countless pits in my journey. The one positive trait that had proved to be highly efficient in boosting me out of these pits is ambition. I know that too much of it could corrupt a person, but so far it had only empowered my spirit with much-needed optimism. My greatest ambition is to become a renowned novelist; therefore every hardship and pain to me befits an inspiration for a potential novel. It is a most optimistic perception of things, and it had succoured me through many phases of emotional turmoil.</p><br />

                            18. Create an essay about your journey in school year that has no covid vs. Now in modular distance learning. Nonsense=report ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student the face to face class is fun because you see your friends, you get to the places you want after a long day at school. There are also many new teachers, classmates and friends. In fact, it is easier to study face to face because this way you feel better because they are able to explain things that you can't understand. Now that the pandemic has begun I am a bit worried about the new ways of teaching that the government considered necessary for social distancing. Adjusting to a new routine is hard. Since we moved to distance learning, most of all I'm glad that schooling hasn't stopped altogether and that in the future we won't have to learn the whole programe at once. So far, lessons don't go as well as they once did in face to face class. Online learning is more exotic than going to school. I like it, but it has some drawbacks. Some are serious, others are not. Sitting at home is fun, but to be honest, it is much more tiring to sit and study at the computer all day long. Many children get pains in the eyes, so there should be a longer break after two lessons. Often, we don't even understand the teacher because of the Internet problems. Sometimes the sound goes off. The idea of studying at home is good, because we still need to learn, but I don't like it so much. It is difficult because we are all learning to work in such an environment now, both teachers and students. Another difficulty is that we need computers, headphones, and microphones. online learning puts more pressure on me as a student and tests my ability to concentrate on academics outside the classroom. I believe that online learning is an effective educational instrument during the pandemic that neither poses risks to the health and lives of people, nor ceases the learning process. However, I still prefer traditional way of learning with its face-to-face lectures and real-life interactive classrooms.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I am a student who studies well for the good nf my future, and I can say that face to face learning is more fun because there is a great opportunity for students as well as their teachers to interact. many things happen in the classroom, there are stories and there are noisy classmates they are your classmates who are often scolded by teachers. Then the school events, your classmates often show off their clothes just to win the events and the other subjects you need to practice like in mapeh, often absent and because there is an excuse letter then to atleast somehow to make your adviser informed. Now in modular class, another type of gaining acces to education due to the presence of pandemic around the world, implemented by DepED to survive the educational poverty that the country is facing. unlike face to face and online aced learning, and modular learning is difficult because students lack interaction with their teachers to seek guidance and help about the tasks assigned to them. The situation seems to be the same when it comes to online paced learning, students are often stressed and many also say that students learn more in f2f classes than in modular and online class learning</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There has never been a time when art critics held more power than during the second half of the twentieth century. Following the Second World War, with the relocation of the world’s artistic epicenter from Paris to New York, a different kind of war was waged in the pages of magazines across the country. As part of the larger “culture wars” of the mid-century, art critics began to take on greater influence than they’d ever held before. For a time, two critics in particular—who began as friends, and remained in the same social circles for much of their lives—set the stakes of the debates surrounding the maturation of American art that would continue for decades. The ideas about art outlined by Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg are still debated today, and the extent to which they were debated in the past has shaped entire movements of the arts. Below are ten works of criticism through which one can trace the mainstreaming of Clement Greenberg’s formalist theory, and how its dismantling led us into institutional critique and conceptual art today.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest mwaa</p><br />

I know that you have been struggling to keep everything together, and it's okay if you don't know exactly how you're going to do it. But I want you to know that it's okay if things get hard sometimes.</p><p></p><p>I know that there are some days when it feels like you have no idea what is going on in your life, but I want to tell you that it's okay not to have all the answers right away—you just need to keep moving forward and keep taking risks even when they seem scary or impossible. Remember: if at first, you don't succeed, try again!</p><p></p><p>You might feel like everyone else around you seems like they have their lives figured out, but let me tell you something: they don't! Even though they might seem like they're happy and confident, they are probably struggling just as much as we are with figuring out who they are and where they belong in this world. And all of us together make up a beautiful mosaic of humanity! So remember: be kind!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>My </strong><strong>direction</strong></p><p>(Own Experience)</p><p></p><p></p><p> I had only had a couple of friends and never really ventured out to make new friends. So, for the majority of that summer I kept to myself, and read the Twilight Saga. During my readings of the Twilight Saga, I became a major fan of the series. This was my very first ‘fandom’, of a long line that will soon come in the upcoming years. I was introduced to Tumblr, where all fan geeks like me gathered to share our feelings on books, music, and art that we liked. Through Tumblr, I was introduced fanfiction and fanart. This was how I got into drawing.</p><p></p><p>I still had no self esteem as an artist. When my mom would call me the little artist, I shrugged at this idea. In my mind, being an artist means you actually have to be good at.</p><p></p><p>The first couple drawings, as you would expect, were really terrible. I thought I was never going to become a good artist, but, for some reason, I kept trying. I needed to practice, so I looked up drawings from other people and tried to mimic. I would draw the same picture a couple times. By doing this, I was training my eyes to pick up details, without even realising at the time.</p><p></p><p>As time went on, I expanded my world by taking on more fandoms. By doing this, I expanded my fuel for more drawings. I continued to draw more often, and started to become better at it. Of course most of my drawings are fan art, but, it helped me improve my basic skills as an artist, such as detail, color, and proportion.</p><p></p><p>So we must all have perseverance. Not everything comes from luck, others come from hard work.  I am a student, striving for what I want to achieve and what can i be achieved.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>G</strong></p><br />

Even there are a lot of circumstances each and everyone of us has faced, we still got to reach other peoples hand, understand their situations, and offer better solutions that may help them. By this, it made me a bit inspired and motivated to do all the modules by seeing them exerting efforts just to reach their dream career and future plans for their life and humanity.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Yan Sana makatulong sayo pre</p><br />
