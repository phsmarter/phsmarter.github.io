Our today's occasion is an outstanding event for all of us as another academic year has come to an end. This means that another group of students graduate from our school and is to start its way into the 'adult life'. 1) ______, this 'adult life' seems to be less appealing and more terrifying with its close oncoming. 2) ____, there are a few important things I am eager to tell our graduates. 3) _____is: do not be afraid of the changes that come to your life; they are crucial, unpredictable, and overwhelming but you are able to deal with them. 4) ______, just built your own way and remember that your families and friends are always there to provide you with any needed support. 5). ______, please, keep in mind the fact that we are graduating after you and look up for you as the examples and inspirations, so, do not be up to anything you would not like us to do. I believe that would be the most suitable advice and recommendation you can hear from someone my age. 6) ________, follow always unto what you really want. 7) _______, I would like to highlight is the crucial value of your dreams as, like the great Steve Jobs pointed out, the way to success is to "dream bigger", and this tool is available for everyone. There has barely been one person in the world that had never failed, so, you, most probably, will not become such an exception. 8)_______, do not limit yourself by the fear of losing, you will lose one day anyway, and this occasion is unpredictable and unpreventable. It may sound absolutely discouraging but have a think about it: if there is nothing to hold you back, everything is possible. With this in mind, make a bold, confident, and reckless step in the life, hurry to fall, 9)_________ the sooner you will do this, the more time you will have for getting back to the top. 10)________ do not let the obstacles and failures stop you as they are just other twists of a great life adventure you are to embark on and we are looking forward to witness. Thank you and congratulations!​</a>

                                            "Josefina"(By May Shynne J. Torralba)Josefina was different from the rest of the girls in the class. She was with theboys most of the time and she liked to play with things that are usually played byboys. Everyone knew that she was an orphan. She was only ten years old when sheleft home to forget the heartaches brought by the tragic death of her parents. Shethought that it was best to leave home and go on with her life under the roof andguidance of her auntie and uncle.In school, she never showed weakness. Her classmates liked her because shewas courageous and agile. She was not afraid to fight with boys. Her curly hair wasalways tied up to show her neatly shaved undercut. Though she was a bit different,her classmates gave the same mutual respect towards her. This made Josefinaexpressed herself freely- from the way she dressed up to the way she carried herself.Nobody dare or care talked about her personal feeling. Not until one morning...Marcelina, her classmate, saw Josefina ran outside the gate of the school. Outof curiosity, she followed her. She called for her but Josefina kept on running untilshe was hidden behind the big tamarind tree. She saw Josefina wailing while herright hand was bleeding for punching the trunk of the tree. Reluctantly, Marcelinashowed herself to her with sympathetic look. Without a single word, Marcelina tookher hand and wiped it until it was clean. Upon hearing the silence, Marcelina tookthe opportunity to ask her classmate. "What happened?" she sighed before shebrought the words out of her mouth. Josefina looked at her and responded clearly."I am scared. I overheard that my auntie and uncle are giving me away because theycould not afford the provision needed to raise me. I don't want to but I was left withno choice. I don't know how other people would treat and accept me. They mightonly laughed and mocked at me because I am different." Marcelina felt herclassmate's honest confession. Then, she comforted her. "You think so much ofthings that has not yet happened. Is it really a sarcastic mouth that scares you orthat small voice inside you? You just need to be you... that is all. No matter whathappens remember that we are always here to comfort you and boost you up." Shepatted her shoulder and smirked to uplift her. The conversation made Josefina feltlighter hence, they made their way back to school.Questions1. Who are the characters in the story?2. Where and when did the story happen?3.

Then, on the space provided before the number, write N if the paragraph isNarrative, E if Expository, P if Persuasive and EX if Explanatory.1. School uniforms are good for the development of children. First of all, everyone is dressed unified. So no one has"better” clothes than others and no one can threaten others only because of their clothes. In many schools ganging up on othersbecause of what they are wearing is already normal and uniforms are a way to protect the children from such acts.School uniforms also keep everyone from having to buy expensive brand of clothes to be part of the society, which relievesespecially the parents and takes the pressure of being "cool" awayfrom the children. School uniforms also help to put, off children being overly concerned about keeping up with the latestfashions. This gives young children more time to concentrate on more important developmental things. Of course, there arealso critics, who say that school uniforms make the children lose their own individuality but in general it is possible to say, thatschool uniforms have a good influence on most children. (Expository)2. The school fair is right around the corner, and tickets have just gone on sale. We are selling a limited number of ticketsat discounts, so move fast and get yours while they are still available. This is going to be an event you will not want to miss!(Persuasive)3. Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of itsbeautiful experiences. But, despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which I am sure I willcarry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. (Narrative)4. Studies have shown that lucky people tend to be far more open to new experiences. Those who are unlucky arecreatures of habit, never varying from one day to the next. If you want to be lucky, add some variety to your life. Meet newpeople, go to the new places, and increase the possibility of those chance opportunities the “lucky' people always seem to runinto. (Persuasive)5. Pat Mora's poem, "Echoes," vividly describes the meaning and mood of the poem by using sensory images. At thebeginning of the poem it was talking about white wine and cool dresses which give you a feel of upperclass elegance. Yet when itwent from the white wine to the white uniform it changed the class of the hostess and the maid. When it mentioned that themaid's smile wavered when the speaker started to talk to her, it showed the level of amazement that the maid felt. However, theend, when it talks about hearing the cruel comment of “just drop the cups and plates / on the grass," it gave the poem a feelingof darkness as the poem told how the speaker stood in silence which describes her contradicting feelings. Towardsthe end of the poem the roar and flash help the reader envision the speaker's rage for the cruelty that is being calmed in a racistsociety. (Explanatory)D.

                            4. "Josefina"(By May Shynne J. Torralba)Josefina was different from the rest of the girls in the class. She was with theboys most of the time and she liked to play with things that are usually played byboys. Everyone knew that she was an orphan. She was only ten years old when sheleft home to forget the heartaches brought by the tragic death of her parents. Shethought that it was best to leave home and go on with her life under the roof andguidance of her auntie and uncle.In school, she never showed weakness. Her classmates liked her because shewas courageous and agile. She was not afraid to fight with boys. Her curly hair wasalways tied up to show her neatly shaved undercut. Though she was a bit different,her classmates gave the same mutual respect towards her. This made Josefinaexpressed herself freely- from the way she dressed up to the way she carried herself.Nobody dare or care talked about her personal feeling. Not until one morning...Marcelina, her classmate, saw Josefina ran outside the gate of the school. Outof curiosity, she followed her. She called for her but Josefina kept on running untilshe was hidden behind the big tamarind tree. She saw Josefina wailing while herright hand was bleeding for punching the trunk of the tree. Reluctantly, Marcelinashowed herself to her with sympathetic look. Without a single word, Marcelina tookher hand and wiped it until it was clean. Upon hearing the silence, Marcelina tookthe opportunity to ask her classmate. "What happened?" she sighed before shebrought the words out of her mouth. Josefina looked at her and responded clearly."I am scared. I overheard that my auntie and uncle are giving me away because theycould not afford the provision needed to raise me. I don't want to but I was left withno choice. I don't know how other people would treat and accept me. They mightonly laughed and mocked at me because I am different." Marcelina felt herclassmate's honest confession. Then, she comforted her. "You think so much ofthings that has not yet happened. Is it really a sarcastic mouth that scares you orthat small voice inside you? You just need to be you... that is all. No matter whathappens remember that we are always here to comfort you and boost you up." Shepatted her shoulder and smirked to uplift her. The conversation made Josefina feltlighter hence, they made their way back to school.Questions1. Who are the characters in the story?2. Where and when did the story happen?3.

School uniforms are good for the development of children. First of all, everyone is dressed unified. So no one has"better” clothes than others and no one can threaten others only because of their clothes. In many schools ganging up on othersbecause of what they are wearing is already normal and uniforms are a way to protect the children from such acts.School uniforms also keep everyone from having to buy expensive brand of clothes to be part of the society, which relievesespecially the parents and takes the pressure of being "cool" awayfrom the children. School uniforms also help to put, off children being overly concerned about keeping up with the latestfashions. This gives young children more time to concentrate on more important developmental things. Of course, there arealso critics, who say that school uniforms make the children lose their own individuality but in general it is possible to say, thatschool uniforms have a good influence on most children. (Expository)2. The school fair is right around the corner, and tickets have just gone on sale. We are selling a limited number of ticketsat discounts, so move fast and get yours while they are still available. This is going to be an event you will not want to miss!(Persuasive)3. Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of itsbeautiful experiences. But, despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which I am sure I willcarry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. (Narrative)4. Studies have shown that lucky people tend to be far more open to new experiences. Those who are unlucky arecreatures of habit, never varying from one day to the next. If you want to be lucky, add some variety to your life. Meet newpeople, go to the new places, and increase the possibility of those chance opportunities the “lucky' people always seem to runinto. (Persuasive)5. Pat Mora's poem, "Echoes," vividly describes the meaning and mood of the poem by using sensory images. At thebeginning of the poem it was talking about white wine and cool dresses which give you a feel of upperclass elegance.
