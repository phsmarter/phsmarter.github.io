                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We all know the effects the pandemic had on the world economy as well as how people function in society. Without a doubt, the pandemic has caused difficulties for everyone, affecting their lifestyles, work, school and how they interact with others. As for a university student living in Japan, I would like to express that the situation is not as dire as other parts of the world. The way that the Japanese government is dealing with Covid-19 is admirable, the fact that the government is not forcing harsh restrictions, rather enforcing that people go through the necessary daily interactions whilst keeping everyone safe. On top of that, the Japanese culture of respecting others' health and safety clearly shined during this pandemic. Japanese people, even before Covid-19, wear masks commonly in order to avoid any possible transmission of diseases. So when the Covid-19 hit, the Japanese population was ready and the fact that everyone is wearing a mask makes it way less worrisome.</p><p></p><p>I for one, have been at peace living in japan during this difficult time as Tokyo International University has switched to an Online teaching system which has been way more effective than I expected. Japan has kept everything calm and peaceful as the people are informed about the latest Covid-19 news but there is no panic within the country. If I were to be somewhere else in the world, I would have to live in quarantine with countless restrictions which would probably affect my mental state. The support for students from both the university and the Japanese government has been exceptional. If a pandemic similar to Covid-19 ever happens again, I am confident that TIU and Japan will be able to keep everyone safe.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>c. Reasons why Online gaming is addictive</p><p></p><p>More than 2 billion individuals play computer games around the world, and the market for computer games is on target to turn into a $90 billion industry in America by 2020. The normal gamer plays for around 6 hours consistently. For most players, everything being equal, playing computer games is a pleasant interest – an approach to unwind, associate with companions, and appreciate a test. Lamentably, for certain players, a computer game side interest can grow into a habit-forming jumble that assumes control over their lives.  </p><p>
</p><p>Lately, the cell phone has outperformed the PC and the control center as the most widely recognized gaming gadget, with computer games now accessible on applications and online media. Besides, enormously multiplayer online pretending games (MMORPGs) keep on being gigantically mainstream. Consistently, games like League of Legends, World of Warcraft, Fortnite, Final Fantasy, and The Elder Scrolls Online bring a great many players into their virtual universes. Around 160 million Americans play MMORPGs and other Internet-based games each day.  </p><p>
</p><p>Comprehend that the measure of time that somebody spends playing a computer game doesn't really demonstrate that they have a fixation. All things considered, somebody could spend numerous hours playing a computer game since they appreciate it, yet they could likewise stop absent a lot of trouble. Paradoxically, an individual may have a dependence on a computer game on the off chance that they can't quit playing it, despite the fact that they realize they ought to. They're mindful that the computer game is making them disregard their family, companions, work, and training, yet they continue to play at any rate since they feel best behind the screen.  </p><p>
</p><p>Besides, computer games influence the mind similarly to habit-forming drugs: they trigger the arrival of dopamine, a substance that supports conduct. Consequently, playing computer games can be a habit-forming boost. These realities show that dependence on computer games might be conceivable. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

My mother always gave the same condition to my sister for her to do her job.  Everything must be done so we would get together to watch tv and enjoy p1zza on the weekends.Modals VerbsModal verbs are used to express a variety of fictitious circumstances, such as suggestions, capacities, or demands. They are used in conjunction with a primary verb to subtly alter its meaning. They can't necessarily be used on their own because they are auxiliary verbs. (A modal verb should only be used by itself if the context makes it obvious what the primary verb is.). Modals are sometimes known as pronouns or auxiliary verbs. Modals, which are auxiliary verbs, can also be referred to as Modal Auxiliary Verbs or Modal Verbs in this context.Types of Modals Verb1. Modals PresentWill example: Will you carry that bag for me?Shallexample:  I shall meet her tomorrowMustexample:  You must go now May example: She may not come tonightShould/ought to example: The work ought to have been finished l4st weekCanexample: Can I smoke here?2. Modals Past: Wouldexample: Would you like to come to her office?Shouldexample:  When he came to my house I should goMust/Had to, example: You must/had to study in Biology cl4ss yesterday. Might, example:  Joni might do the exam well.Couldexample: Could I borrow your dictionary?3.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>a</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Students should not be permitted to use smartphones in school. Using smartphones during school allows students to use it in the middle of discussion .  Students will be more distracted by cell phones and pay less attention to the teacher and to the lesson.  Students have a higher chance of getting in trouble if they use cell phones in school rather than if they are not allowed to use it in school. </p><p> </p><p></p><p>A.When cell phones ring during class, it disrupts the students and teacher; this often causes the teacher to lose his or her train of thought. Thus, cell phones can be a major learning distraction in public high schools</p><p>B. Because may deter crime and increase student safety. School uniforms keep students focused on their education, not their clothes. School uniforms create a level playing field among students, reducing peer pressure and bullying. Wearing uniforms enhances school pride, unity, and community spirit</p><p>C. Yes. You can’t be in a relationship if it is already broken. I am referring to battered and emotionally disturbed wives and also the wives whose husbands are cheating. Annulment takes so long and it is very expensive.</p><br />
